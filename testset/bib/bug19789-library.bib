@book{Ramachandran2009,
annote = {In Spring 2010 I used this book to teach a calculus-based undergraduate course in statistics and probability at Metropolitan State University in Saint Paul. I covered chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12 and 13. 

        
In short, I cannot recommend the book. Explanations are often verbose and hard to follow, there are no problem solutions in the back of the book, and there is a plethora of typos and more serious mistakes throughout the book. Below is a detailed list of the mistakes I found in the first printing of the first edition. It is to be hoped that these will be corrected in later printings. 

        
The numbers of many problems haven't been checked, often leading to outrageous and unrealistic probabilities or p-values etc. Examples are the problems 4.1.8, 4.1.9, 4.1.10, 4.1.13, 4.1.14, 4.4.5, 4.4.6, 7.1.6, 7.4.8, 7.4.12, 7.4.15, 7.5.5, 7.6.3, 7.6.4, 12.4.7. 

        
P.8 Definition 1.3.1 falsely asserts that if every element of the population has the same chance of being chosen, then every size n subset is equally likely. 

        
P.27 Definition 1.5.2 for upper and lower quartile is incorrect (or at least unclear) in the case of several identical data items. 

        
P.67 Birthday paradox example, final answer for n=40 is wrong. 

        
P.73 Example 2.4.3 notation and concept of "genetic makeup" and "allele" are not sufficiently explained for non-biologists. 

        
P.77 Step three of Bayes' Rule: "denominator probability" is not explained; the rule as written is not clear. 

        
P.83 Problem 2.6.29 Variable i is used twice. "Head ith probability p" is unclear. 

        
P.85 Line 5: "for all real values x of X" should be "for all real numbers"; this is the whole point of the sentence. 

        
P.90 Problems 2.5.2 and 2.5.3 use the terms "probability function" and "distribution"; should be "probability mass function". 2.5.4 should not use the notation p(x) for the cdf. 

        
P.91 Problem 2.5.5 No random variable can have the given cdf, since it isn't right continuous. 

        
P.95 Definition 2.6.3 The crucial difference between E((X-mu)^2) and (E(X-mu))^2 is obscured by writing E(X-mu)^2. The definition is not clear. Ambiguous notations such as E(X-mu)^2, EX^2, E(X-my)^3 and E(X-muX)(Y-muY) are used throughout the book. 

        
P.106 Problem 2.6.8: variance 4 is not needed. 

        
P.121 The Poisson approximation "rule of thumb" np<5 is only valid for large n. 

        
P.128 Explanation of QQ plot is not intelligible. r_i is not "the rank i-th observation", but the "rank of the i-th observation". Figure 3.3 cannot be understood; there should be just as many points to the right of 0.0 as there are to the left. Furthermore, on p.312 the horizontal and vertical axes of QQ plots are reversed. On p.222 it is called "normal-score plot", using a different rule. Step 4 (45 degree line) is wrong. 

        
The fundamental relationship of Poisson variables and exponential variables in describing Poisson processes is nowhere mentioned. 

        
P.141 last line: the very first double integral in the book is wrong, confusing students immensely. "dxdy" should be "dydx". On p.142 bottom, "dxdy" is missing altogether. 

        
P.146 Definition 3.3.5 E(X,Y) should be E(XY). 

        
P.147 Theorem 3.3.2(b) Var(X|Y) has not been defined. 

        
P.149 top: rho does not depend on lower case x and y, so rho(x,y) does not make sense. The statement "if Y=aX+b (a<>0) then rho=1" is false. In the "Properties" box, Cov(X;Y) must be replaced by rho. 

        
The crucial theorem stating that the variance of a sum of independent variables equals the sum of the variances is used throughout the book, but never clearly stated or proved. 

        
P.151 Problem 3.3.5 These are marginal probability mass functions, not density functions. 

        
P.152 Problem 3.3.14 The notation for "proportional" has not been introduced. 

        
P.153 Problem 3.3.18 X and Y cannot be independent. 

        
P.165 line 6: restriction K>=2 not needed. However it should be mentioned that Chebyshev's Theorem is only interesting for K>1. 

        
P.166 Theorem 3.5.2 The notations X-bar and S_n have not been defined. In the proof, the undefined abbreviation "iid" is used (which also cannot be found in the index). However, the variables were not assumed to be iid. 

        
P.168 Theorem 3.5.2 It should be emphasized that the central limit theorem has one important assumption: that the mean and variance be finite. On the other hand, the moment generating function is not needed for the statement. 

        
P.169 Example 3.5.7 (b) assumption n=300 is missing. (c) what is n? 

        
P.170 Example 3.5.8 is completely unclear. "such that they can be confident"? How confident? In the solution the confidence 0.99 appears out of the blue. The maximum of pq should be explained with calculus. The fundamental importance of this example needs to be explained: it is used to estimate any unknown probability, not just unfair coins. 

        
P.172 Problem 3.5.4 This should be "number of cars arriving at a busy intersection in a given 20 minute interval". 

        
P.173 All the problems from section 3.5 return later in section 4.1. 

        
P.184 line 5: the normal distribution is not called "the theorem of de Moivre-Laplace". 

        
P.185 Example 4.1.1 The last paragraph should not be part of the example. 

        
P.186 Theorem 4.1.1 Was already used on p.167. The last sentence is Theorem 3.5.2. 

        
P.187 Example 4.1.2 Cannot be solved at this point, needs Corollary 4.2.2! 

        
P.213 "z-series" should be "z-scores" 

        
P.215 "(a+0.5)" should be "(b+0.5)" 

        
P.217 Problem 4.4.10 "90 heads" should be "at least 90 heads". 

        
P.316 line 2: "we know that" should give a reference to the proper theorem. 

        
P.328 Problem 6.5.9 "1997" and "1998" should be "2000" and "2001". 

        
P.341 figure at the bottom: explain the meaning of the two distributions, "critical value" has not been explained. 

        
Many hypothesis tests are taken to be one-tailed, without proper justification. In the real world, such justification is extremely rare. 

        
While the text emphasizes the importance of computing p-values, the worked examples almost never show the computation of p-values. 

        
The crucial difference between the size of an effect and the statistical significance of an effect is not sufficiently emphasized. 

        
P.345 Example 7.1.5 is unrealistic, testing a null hypothesis of mu=15 against an alternative of mu=16. The value mu=16 should only be used to compute beta, not as alternative hypothesis. 

        
P.346 The example is unintelligible, since mu_a is not explained. 

        
P.349 Problem 7.1.5(c) beta=0.8 is completely unrealistic. 

        
P.365 Top: Assumption n>=30 for the large sample case is incomplete: we also need finite variance! 

        
P.373 Line 4: X_{1n_1}, X_{2n_2} 

        
P.387 Problem 7.5.9: Cannot assume that the samples are independent; only part (c) makes any sense. 

        
P.389 Top: Definitions of Q^2 is wrong; denominator should be np_i. 

        
P.390 Box: "exact methods are available etc." is not an assumption. 

        
P.390 Should point out the crucial logical issue here: if Q^2 is small, then we don't have enough evidence to reject H_0; this DOES NOT imply that we have evidence in favor of H_0! Same mistake in example 7.6.3. 

        
P.391 "n=4" should be "k=4"; n is 500. 

        
P.392 Section 7.6.2 Horrible language. 

        
P.393 bottom of box: E_{ij} = n_{i.}n_{.j} (Same typo on p.394). 

        
P.393 Explanation for the degrees of freedom formula (r-1)(c-1) is missing. 

        
P.398 Problem 7.6.5 Where does H_0 come from? Does it talk about before or after advertising? 

        
P.601 Line 6: "differing only in median or mean 3"?? 

        
P.602 The given approach for computing confidence intervals for the median is wrong. The median will be below X_{a+1} with probability alpha/2. 

        
P.603 Example 12.2.1. Don't report this as a 95% confidence interval; state the correct confidence level instead. 

        
P.607 Section 12.3.1 Assumption of continuous distribution should be stated first; no need to repeat P(X<=M)=0.5 later. 

        
P.608 Bottom. Explain what "ties" are. 

        
P.621 Step 2 of box is not clear. 

        
P.621 Bottom: why switch from N_{1b} to N_{1a}? 

        
P.622 Box: Variance formula contradicts the one given on the previous page; expected value formula should have n_1, not N_1. 

        
P.625 Line 6: denominator should be sqrt(1.68), not sqrt(16,900). 

        
P.685 Metropolis Algorithm: the problem that the algorithm solves is not motivated. Surely it should be trivial to generate values according to a given discrete probability distribution? After all, step 1 of the algorithm requires just that. 

        
P.659 Why are "pseudo values" defined if they are not used for the jackknife estimate? 

        
P.666 Example 13.3.2 Last sentence: 12.37 and 43.9 should not be compared: one is a standard error, the other a standard deviation. Need to divide by square root of 12. 

        
P.671 line 5: g(x,y)|theta should be g(x,y|theta) 

        
P.663 The word "resampling" is used, but the core idea of resampling is not explained. 

        
P.684 line 1: state space S is not used. 

        
P.684 line 8: p(x,y) = p_{m,m+1}(x,y) 

        
P.684 "...then the limiting distribution is the invariant distribution" does not make sense: they are always the same! 

        
P.684 "ergodic" is not defined. 

        
P.689 Metropolis-Hastings algorithm: "x_n = x_{n-1}" should be "x_{k+1}=x_k". 

        
P.758 Appendix III: In Def 3.2.7, the exponential distribution was given with a parameter beta, not lambda. 

        
P.758 Appendix III: Formula for the pdf of a normal distribution is wrong. },

In the latter situation, many different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

@article{Allen1986,
abstract = {This study tested Pascarella's reconceptualization of Tinto's model of the persistence/withdrawal process for use in a non-residential institution. Subjects (n=372) were college freshmen who had attended freshmen orientation and had completed an opinionnaire both during orientation and at the end of their first year in a medium-sized, urban commuter institution. Path analysis and estimates of direct and indirect causal effects were used to test the predictive validity of the model. Results tended to confirm the importance of applying causal models cautiously even within the same types of institutions. Results further suggest that there is considerable between-institution variance within the broad category of commuter colleges. The influence of key concepts such as social integration and institutional commitment were found to vary significantly from the reconceptualized version of Tinto's model. The degree of fit between the individual student and the institutional environment was largely predicated upon the magnitude of relationship between academic integration and institutional commitment. Other things being equal, the greater the individual's level of academic integration, the greater his or her subsequent commitment to the institution. The combination of academic integration and subsequent commitment were seen as having a positive influence on persistence. (Author/ABL)},

However, these students often have difficulties navigating social systems, and higher education presents great challenges.

Parents reported a variety of strategies that colleges can use to support students with Asperger’s Syndrome within postsecondary settings and provided insights into their expectations for college-level supports. Implications for practice and recommendations for future research are discussed.},
annote = {Students with Aspbergers syndrome (AS) have typical intellectual abilities yet limited social skills which may inhibit success in a post-secondary environment. A survey from parents showed there need to be more advocacy for students with AS and more knowledge abuot AS, parents noted especially effective in working one on one with workers in universities. in addition alternative routes should be there to transition into adult life, community colleges are a good step to a 4 year school that may not have some of the supports. There was also need for students to be taught to be better self advocates, but also being in a place where they feel supported. Although all parents in this study noted there would be higher level of involvement than typically developing peers.},

@article{RamakrishnaRao,
abstract = {Yoga-Sutras of Patanjali is a foundational psychological text that organizes, codifies, and systematically presents in s_tra form the psychology as practised in India around second century BCE. Its theme is to help humans free themselves from their congenital bondage due to conditioned existence and consequent suffering. The goal is to restore the person to her inherent unconditioned blissful being. The quintessence of Yoga is meditation. Meditation consists of dharana (concentration, focused attention) and dhyana, a contemplative state of passive attention precipitated by a prolonged practice of concentration. Dhy_na practice leads to sam_dhi, a stand-still altered state in which the mind is controlled and restrained from habitual cognitive processing. This paper provides a theoretical background of Patanjali Yoga and a select review of empirical research on the neurophysiological correlates of meditation, highlighting on the one hand some of its methodological shortcomings and conceptual problems and suggesting on the other hand the areas of promise for further research on meditation},

@book{Jones2009,
abstract = {Known for its versatility, the free programming language R is widely used for statistical computing and graphics, but is also a fully functional programming language well suited to scientific programming. An Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using Rteaches the skills needed to perform scientific programming while also introducing stochastic modelling. Stochastic modelling in particular, and mathematical modelling in general, are intimately linked to scientific programming because the numerical techniques of scientific programming enable the practical application of mathematical models to real-world problems. Following a natural progression that assumes no prior knowledge of programming or probability, the book is organised into four main sections: Programming In Rstarts with how to obtain and install R (for Windows, MacOS, and Unix platforms), then tackles basic calculations and program flow, before progressing to function based programming, data structures, graphics, and object-oriented code A Primer on Numerical Mathematicsintroduces concepts of numerical accuracy and program efficiency in the context of root-finding, integration, and optimization A Self-contained Introduction to Probability Theorytakes readers as far as the Weak Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, equipping them for point and interval estimation Simulation teaches how to generate univariate random variables, do Monte-Carlo integration, and variance reduction techniques In the last section, stochastic modelling is introduced using extensive case studies on epidemics, inventory management, and plant dispersal. A tried and tested pedagogic approach is employed throughout, with numerous examples, exercises, and a suite of practice projects. Unlike most guides to R, this volume is not about the application of statistical techniques, but rather shows how to turn algorithms into code. It is for those who want to make tools, not just use them.},

The spectral representations of the likelihood ratio test and the restricted likelihood ratio test statistics are used as the basis of efficient simulation algorithms of their null distributions. The large sample $\chi$2 mixture approximations using the usual asymptotic theory for a null hypothesis on the boundary of the parameter space have been shown to be poor in simulation studies. Our asymptotic calculations explain these empirical results. The theory of Self and Liang applies only to linear mixed models for which the data vector can be partitioned into a large number of independent and identically distributed subvectors. One-way analysis of variance and penalized splines models illustrate the results.},

A quantitative causal model, that relied on several theoretical frameworks, was tested via structural equation modelling for categorical data that incorporated constructs from the financial aid literature as well as the persistence literature. The research design was longitudinal in nature and analyses were conducted on a sample of 466 college students who were attending a large public urban commuter institution in the spring of 1989. In sum, results appeared to suggest that financial aid is important, not only because it equalizes opportunities between affluent and low-income students, but also because it facilitates the integration of the student into both the academic and social components of the institution as well as influencing his or her commitment to stay in college. Contains 51 references. (Author/GLR)},

@article{Kabaila2009,
abstract = {It is very common in applied frequentist ("classical") statistics to carry out a preliminary statistical (i.e. data-based) model selection by, for example, using preliminary hypothesis tests or minimizing AIC. This is usually followed by the inference of interest, using the same data, based on the assumption that the selected model had been given to us a priori. This assumption is false and it can lead to an inaccurate and misleading inference. We consider the important case that the inference of interest is a confidence region. We review the literature that shows that the resulting confidence regions typically have very poor coverage properties. We also briefly review the closely related literature that describes the coverage properties of prediction intervals after preliminary statistical model selection. A possible motivation for preliminary statistical model selection is a wish to utilize uncertain prior information in the inference of interest. We review the literature in which the aim is to utilize uncertain prior information directly in the construction of confidence regions, without requiring the intermediate step of a preliminary statistical model selection. We also point out this aim as a future direction for research. En statistiques appliqu\'{e}es de l'approche fr\'{e}quentiste ("classique"), il est courant de proc\'{e}der \`{a} une s\'{e}lection pr\'{e}liminaire du mod\`{e}le statistique (c'est-\`{a}-dire bas\'{e}e sur des donn\'{e}es) en utilisant, par exemple, des tests pr\'{e}liminaires fond\'{e}s sur des hypoth\`{e}ses ou en minimisant AIC. Ceci est g\'{e}n\'{e}ralement suivi par l'inf\'{e}rence d'int\'{e}r\^{e}t, o\`{u} les m\^{e}mes donn\'{e}es sont utilis\'{e}es, et qui suppose que le mod\`{e}le choisi nous avait \'{e}t\'{e} donn\'{e}\`{a} priori. Cette supposition est erron\'{e}e et peut entra\^{\i}ner une inf\'{e}rence inexacte et trompeuse. Nous examinons un cas primordial o\`{u} l'inf\'{e}rence d'int\'{e}r\^{e}t constitue une r\'{e}gion de confiance. Nous \'{e}tudions la documentation qui indique que les r\'{e}gions de confiance qui en r\'{e}sultent ont en principe des propri\'{e}t\'{e}s d'application r\'{e}duites. Nous examinons \'{e}galement de mani\`{e}re succincte les \'{e}crits en \'{e}troite relation qui d\'{e}crivent les propri\'{e}t\'{e}s d'application des intervalles de pr\'{e}diction apr\`{e}s la s\'{e}lection pr\'{e}liminaire du mod\`{e}le statistique. Il est possible que la motivation sous-tendant la s\'{e}lection pr\'{e}liminaire du mod\`{e}le statistique repr\'{e}sente un d\'{e}sir d'utilizer des renseignements pr\'{e}alables incertains dans l'inf\'{e}rence d'int\'{e}r\^{e}t. Nous \'{e}tudions la documentation o\`{u} l'objectif est d'utilizer des renseignements pr\'{e}alables incertains directement dans l'\'{e}laboration de r\'{e}gions de confiance, sans exiger de recourir \`{a} l'\'{e}tape interm\'{e}diaire de s\'{e}lection pr\'{e}liminaire du mod\`{e}le statistique.

Comparisons are made with a traditional logistic regression approach. The data pertain to one large university. The techniques illustrated may be extended to the analysis of data sets encompassing many institutions, making meaningful interinstitutional comparisons of performance feasible even when there is hierarchical clustering present in the data.},

abstract = {What enables young people with significant impairments to make the transition to adulthood? Becoming householders, finding work, becoming parents, feeling included as citizens: these are all more challenging in the context of housing needs, a discriminatory labour market, the need for personal assistance and transport. Our study interviewed a group of 31 young adults in receipt of disability living allowance, who had jobs and independent households, and smaller comparative groups, who had one or neither of these. We explored disabled people's own accounts of adulthood and what had facilitated their achievement of jobs and independent living. Education, family, employment, personal assistance, housing, benefits and welfare services were on our agenda, but respondents' own accounts are of exceptional' parents as the key.However, not everyone can have exceptional parents. We discuss the politics and economics of parenthood that prevailed while our respondents grew up, when parental responsibilities were extended and parental resources reduced. And we ask how much the politics of parenthood under New Labour offers to families with disabled children.},
annote = {This article discusses the nature of parenting, and gets into the idea of "exceptional" parents. While it does deviate into politics which are not relevant in the US (the article written under policies of the United Kingdom) the idea of "exceptional" parents is a universal one. Disability inevitably brings lower resources and higher stress and more responsibility on a family system, and the ability to cope with this will vary among individuals. The difference in parenting styles will have dramatic effects on their children and the relationships young adults have with their parents will directly affect their chances of a successful transition.},

The analytic sample is limited to first-time, full-time, degree-seeking undergraduates attending 4-year colleges and universities nationwide. This study finds that selectivity, as measured by the average student academic ability at an institution, has a contextual effect on college student persistence that reflects a positive increment to the chance of persistence that accrues to a student beyond student-level predictors of persistence. Although the implications of the findings are mainly for theory and methods, policy implications are discussed.},

This article presents review of literature on faculty attitudes towards persons with disabilities in four different parts: attitudes as a construct, views on attitudes towards disabilities, measurement of attitude towards disabilities, and studies done at colleges and universities with faculty. The fourth section discusses various variables that influence attitudes of faculty towards disabilities. Implications for future studies are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The present research examines whether mastery and performance goals predict different ways of reacting to a sociocognitive conflict with another person over materials to be learned, an issue not yet addressed by the achievement goal literature. Results from 2 studies showed that mastery goals predicted epistemic conflict regulation (a conflict regulation strategy focused on the attempt to integrate both points of view), whereas performance goals predicted relational conflict regulation (a conflict regulation strategy focused on the evaluation and affirmation of self-competence). Study 1 shows these links via direct self-report measures of conflict regulation. Study 2 shows the same links using the amount of competence reported for the self and for the other as subtle measures of conflict regulation.

The study utilized data on 58,281 students who participated in the 2006 University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES). The findings reveal differences in the frequency of student–faculty interaction across student gender, race, social class and first-generation status, and differences in the effects of student–faculty interaction (i.e., conditional effects) that depended on each of these factors except first-generation status. The findings provide implications for educational practice on how to maximize the educational efficacy of student–faculty interaction by minimizing the gender, race, social class, and first-generation differences associated with it.},

@article{Carpenter1994,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE. Research in rehabilitation has been focused primarily on provision of care issues and treatment intervention outcome measures. The input of the clients involved has not been solicited in a systematic way. As a physical therapist practicing in rehabilitation, the researcher became increasingly aware of a discrepancy between the perception of spinal cord injury and its consequences held by health professionals and those people who experience the injury over many years. It was recognition of this discrepancy that formed the background from which this study evolved. The purpose of this qualitative research study was to explore individual conceptions of the experience of spinal cord injury from the perspective of adult learning. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 individuals who had sustained a traumatic spinal cord injury 3 to 5 years prior to the interview. Questions asked were nondirective and designed to trigger accounts of meaningful aspects of the subjects' disability experience since their injury. Data analysis entailed several thorough readings of the interview transcripts from which three categories of meaning developed and for which criteria were established. RESULTS. The categories of meaning--rediscovery of self, redefining disability, and establishing a new identity--represented commonalities of conceptions of the spinal cord injury and the resulting disability experience. The continuity of "self" was of primary importance to the ongoing experience of disability, and the learning involved was diverse and intensely personal. Strategies used by the subjects in achieving these categories are discussed. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION. Although the contribution of the rehabilitation instruction, and particularly that of individual health care professionals, was acknowledged by the subjects, the adequacy of the preparation of clinicians for their role as adult educators in the rehabilitation process is questioned. A theory of transformative learning is introduced as a possible explanatory model for the study findings, application of which may facilitate a more client-centered approach to rehabilitation practice.},

Studies of capital inform postsecondary transition research and practice in key areas including self-determination, parent participation, access to appropriate curriculum, and linkages to adult services. Expanding the foci of postsecondary transition to include the study of capital may increase the efficacy of transition planning and instruction for youth with disabilities from other marginalized groups.},

abstract = {This study explored the role of financial aid in promoting year-to-year persistence over a five-year period following reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 1992. The study cohort included 6,711 full-time beginning freshmen in the fall 1993/1994 terms at Arizona State University. Variables examined were (1) effects of receiving any financial aid, (2) amount of financial aid, (3) amount of debt, and (4) type of debt. The study found that receipt of aid had a positive influence on persistence, although only in the second-to-third year when aided students were more than twice as likely to return; amount of aid had a significant effect in the first three years, with the odds of persisting increasing from 4 to 12 percent per $1,000 of additional aid; amount of debt has a positive and significant effect in the first three years, with a student having more than $1,000 of debt being 2 to 8 percent more likely to return; unsubsidized debt was negatively associated with persistence in each transition period, although not at a significant level. The paper concludes that the 1992 financial aid program promotes year-to-year persistence, and that the amount and type of debt assumed by students has not had a significantly negative impact on retention.

@article{Adams1997,
abstract = {Although theoretical statements regarding the conceptualization of marital commitment abound in the literature, no research has attempted to compare these conceptualizations empirically. Six studies involving 1,787 participants explored the conceptual structure of marital commitment through a variety of empirical methods. Results suggested the existence of 3 primary dimensions of marital commitment: an attraction component based on devotion, satisfaction, and love, a moral normative component based on a sense of personal responsibility for maintaining the marriage and on the belief that marriage is an important social and religious institution, and a constraining component based on fear of the social, financial, and emotional costs of relationship termination. These factors most strongly resemble the three dimensions proposed by M. P. Johnson (1991) but also appear to represent the general features of interpersonal commitment described in most theoretical treatments of the construct and correspond well with couples' personal accounts of what it feels like to be in a committed relationship.

The current pilot study explores the perceptions of primarily 8-12 year old Mexican-American children in relation to viewing a photograph of a child in a wheelchair versus a child sitting in a kitchen chair. Quantitative results indicated that respondents generally expressed optimistic attitudes regarding the child in the wheelchair's future in relation to work, attending college, marrying and having a family. The child in the wheelchair was also perceived as happy but having fewer friends. Qualitative responses centered around the child in a wheelchair's perceived preoccupation with being in a wheelchair and wanting to walk.

abstract = {College students use information and communication technologies at much higher levels and in different ways than prior generations. They are also more likely to multitask while using information and communication technologies. However, few studies have examined the impacts of multitasking on educational outcomes among students. This study fills a gap in this area by utilizing a large-sample web-based survey of college student technology usage to examine how instant messaging and multitasking affect perceived educational outcomes. Since multitasking can impede the learning process through a form of information overload, we explore possible predictors of academic impairment due to multitasking. Results of this study suggest that college students use instant messaging at high levels, they multitask while using instant messaging, and over half report that instant messaging has had a detrimental effect on their schoolwork. Higher levels of instant messaging and specific types of multitasking activities are associated with students reporting not getting schoolwork done due to instant messaging. We discuss implications of these findings for researchers studying the social impacts of technology and those in higher education administration.},

abstract = {We consider random effects meta-analysis where the outcome variable is the occurrence of some event of interest. The data structures handled are where one has one or more groups in each study, and in each group either the number of subjects with and without the event, or the number of events and the total duration of follow-up is available. Traditionally, the meta-analysis follows the summary measures approach based on the estimates of the outcome measure(s) and the corresponding standard error(s). This approach assumes an approximate normal within-study likelihood and treats the standard errors as known. This approach has several potential disadvantages, such as not accounting for the standard errors being estimated, not accounting for correlation between the estimate and the standard error, the use of an (arbitrary) continuity correction in case of zero events, and the normal approximation being bad in studies with few events. We show that these problems can be overcome in most cases occurring in practice by replacing the approximate normal within-study likelihood by the appropriate exact likelihood. This leads to a generalized linear mixed model that can be fitted in standard statistical software. For instance, in the case of odds ratio meta-analysis, one can use the non-central hypergeometric distribution likelihood leading to mixed-effects conditional logistic regression. For incidence rate ratio meta-analysis, it leads to random effects logistic regression with an offset variable. We also present bivariate and multivariate extensions. We present a number of examples, especially with rare events, among which an example of network meta-analysis.},

Personal characteristics and overall climate associated with each institutional type explained statistically significant but modest amounts of the variance in student participation in specific campus activities that help define campus life. Moreover, several personal characteristics were related to students' campus behavior differently across institutional types.

abstract = {A study was conducted to investigate the validity of Tinto's model of college withdrawal in a public four-year college and a private two-year institution. The model consists of six sets of variables in a causal sequence; i.e., background characteristics, initial goal and institutional commitment, academic and social integration, subsequent goal and institutional commitment, intention to persist or withdraw, and persistence/withdrawal behavior. Data for the study were collected during the 1986-87 and 1987-88 academic years from 400 randomly selected, full-time, white, female, residential freshmen. The students were surveyed regarding their interactions with peers, faculty, and the institution, and regarding the educational goal commitments that resulted from integration into the social and academic systems of the institution. Additional information on student background characteristics were supplied by the schools. Study findings, based on responses from 165 (83%) of the junior college students and 100 (51%) of the university students, included the following: (1) in the pooled sample, persistence was directly affected only by intention, though both institutional commitment and social integration had indirect effects on persistence; (2) in both samples, background characteristics played a minimal role in predicting persistence/withdrawal behavior, which was consistent with Tinto's model; (3) at the private institution, academic integration was seen to have a direct negative effect on academic persistence; and (4) institutional commitment was strongly linked to social integration, but, contrary to theoretical expectations, goal commitment was not associated with academic integration.

Seidman and his contributors also lay out the financial implications and trends of retention in one of their updated chapters. Completely new to this edition are three chapters that examine several recent issues: the current theories of retention, retention of online students, and retention in community colleges. Tying all of these components together, Seidman then presents his formula and highly successful model for student success that colleges can implement to effect change in retaining students and helping them to complete their academic and personal goals.},

abstract = {Affect and emotions are frequently seen as outcomes of mastery and performance goals, but affective experiences may also predict goal adoption. In a predictive study (N = 669 first-year college students), the authors used structural equation modeling to estimate relationships from 2 initial affective experiences to mastery and performance-approach goals, from goals to discrete emotions, and from discrete emotions to final grades in a university course while controlling for prior achievement. Representing initial affective experiences, hopefulness positively predicted mastery and performance goals, whereas helplessness negatively predicted mastery goals. Mastery goals positively predicted enjoyment, which in turn positively predicted achievement, and negatively predicted boredom, which in turn negatively predicted achievement. Anxiety was negatively predicted by mastery goals, positively predicted by performance goals, and exerted a negative predictive influence on achievement. The findings suggest that predictive relationships between goals and achievement are mediated by students’ emotions. Results are discussed with regard to the importance of affect and emotions for achievement goal theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (from the journal abstract)},

Four experimenters (2 male and 2 female) requested directions to the bookstore from a total of 160 college students on a university campus. Each experimenter portrayed a student with a disability using a wheelchair and a student without a disability. Conversations were surreptitiously recorded, and verbal interaction patterns were analyzed. Significant differences were observed on all dependent variables, word counts, frequency of interrogatives, and use of locator words. Findings suggest that individuals with a disability are addressed differently than those without disabilities, and provide limited behavioral replication of research documenting differential responses of college students to persons with and without disabilities.

abstract = {In many biometrical applications, the count data encountered often contain extra zeros relative to the Poisson distribution. Zero-inflated Poisson regression models are useful for analyzing such data, but parameter estimates may be seriously biased if the nonzero observations are over-dispersed and simultaneously correlated due to the sampling design or the data collection procedure. In this paper, a zero-inflated negative binomial mixed regression model is presented to analyze a set of pancreas disorder length of stay (LOS) data that comprised mainly same-day separations. Random effects are introduced to account for inter-hospital variations and the dependency of clustered LOS observations. Parameter estimation is achieved by maximizing an appropriate log-likelihood function using an EM algorithm. Alternative modeling strategies, namely the finite mixture of Poisson distributions and the non-parametric maximum likelihood approach, are also considered. The detemidnation of pertinent covariates would assist hospital administrators and clinicians to manage LOS and expenditures efficiently.},

Previous studies, often based on aggregated data on public protests, focus on the effects of elections on established social movement organizations (SMOs). Some find that SMOs flourish during election years, taking advantage of the political opportunities that elections pose. Others conclude that elections hurt SMOs, siphoning members and resources. Using ethnographic, in-depth interview, and document data on new and emerging social movement groups (SMGs) in Pittsburgh for 20 months before and after the 2004 U.S. presidential election, we examine how members think about elections and whether and how groups decide to respond to national electoral campaigns. We find that SMGs vary considerably in the strategies of action or inaction they adopt, depending on their changing sense of whether the election poses an opportunity or a threat to the group and that these strategies of action are patterned in path-dependent sequences. We conclude with a discussion of the possibilities for integrating concepts of path-dependency and timing into social movement research.},

abstract = {1 The onset and duration of action of benzodiazepines after single oral doses depend largely on absorption rate and extent of distribution, respectively. 2 The rate and extent of accumulation during multiple dosage depend on elimination half-life and clearance. A framework is proposed for classification of benzodiazepines according to elimination half-life. 3 Long-acting benzodiazepines have half-life values usually exceeding 24 hours. Drugs in this category have long-acting pharmacologically active metabolites (often desmethyldiazepam), accumulate extensively during multiple dosage, and may have impaired clearance in the elderly and those with liver disease. 4 Intermediate and short-acting benzodiazepines have half-life values from 5-24 hours. Active metabolites are uncommon. Accumulation during multiple dosage is less extensive than with the long-acting group, and diminishes as the half-life becomes shorter. Age and liver disease have a small influence on metabolic clearance. 5 The half-life of ultrashort acting benzodiazepines is less than 5 hours. These drugs are essentially non-accumulating. 6 Pharmacokinetic classification may assist in understanding of differences among benzodiazepines, but does not explain all of their clinical actions.},

abstract = {Although models have been proposed to explain common factors that maintain comorbid pain and PTSD [Sharp TJ, Harvey AG. Chronic pain and posttraumatic stress disorder: mutual maintenance? Clin Psychol Rev 2001; 21: 857-77], the exact nature of the relationship between these two conditions and their impact on quality of life (QOL) is unknown. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the unique and interactive effects of PTSD and pain on role functioning and life satisfaction--two important domains of QOL. The study utilized a help-seeking sample of motor vehicle accident (MVA) survivors whose accidents resulted in symptoms of comorbid PTSD and pain (N=192). Hierarchical regression models were used to examine the relationship between four PTSD symptom clusters, pain, and the interaction of each cluster and pain on role functioning and life satisfaction separately. Results of these analyses revealed a significant interaction of pain and emotional numbing on role functioning, suggesting a multiplicative effect on this domain of QOL. Decomposition of this interaction revealed a negative association between numbing and functioning at low levels of pain but no relationship at higher levels. A marginal interaction of pain and hyperarousal also was noted for life satisfaction. Decomposition of the interaction effect revealed a marginal association between hyperarousal and decreased satisfaction only at high levels of pain. A main effect of emotional numbing on decreased life satisfaction also was observed in this model, suggesting a unique influence of numbing. The results of the current research indicate that the synergistic relationship of pain and PTSD may vary across domains of QOL.},

        What is the article about?
        
          

        after turning 19 what is the first seven years of political participation like for young people.
          

          
In the literature review and/or conceptual framework, how do authors talk about the relationship between political participation/orientation and life course experiences, and/or the relationship between political participation/orientation and college experiences?
        
          

        they mention many of the things we have talked about, setling down, marriage, community ties, getting a job, leaving school (although thats often less mentioned), since this focuses on seven years it captures some of what we are studing since it captuers a few years after college graduation.
          

          
What interesting thoughts or assertions did authors make in literature review or discussion that we can use in our paper? (e.g., “the need to promote political participation is essential for our democracy,” “those who do not participate politically are likely to have a highly undemocratic view of the world”) Basically think about things we can use for fodder.
        
          

        looks at the first years of life, which includes college years for most young people.
          

          
What variables or concepts relate to political participation?
        
          

        voter turn out of young adults.
          

          
What are the research questions of the study?
        
          

        what predicts voter turn out of young adults.
          

          
What data was used or collected?
        
          

        current population survey
          

          
What methodologies were employed?
        
          

        logistic regression
          

          
IF SEM, describe model they intend to estimate
        
          

        NA
          

          
What findings were relevant to understanding political participation? 
home ownership, residential stability, labor force status, being female, more education, higher family income and greater age led to greater voting. living with parents and being married exerted negative effects, the other effects were positive.
          

          
What interesting things stated in the discussion can we use for our paper.  Make sure you cite everything.
        
          

        leaving home, being single, and having a higher family income led to greater participation of voting (my personal reflections, not from discussion). 
          

          
List citations of other studies that authors reference of regarding the relationship between political participation/orientation and/or the relationship between life course experiences, and/or political participation and college experiences?

abstract = {Objective: To investigate possible barriers to successful social and sexual relationships in adolescents and young adults of normal intelligence with cerebral palsy. Design: A literature review based on a PubMed and PsycINFO search for the period 1990-2003. Included were studies focusing on one or more of the outcome parameters (i.e. social, intimate and sexual relationships) or on associated factors that described relationships with the outcome parameters. Results: Fourteen papers were selected. Two studies investigated exclusively people with cerebral palsy whereas 12 concerned people with a congenital disability and/or physical disabilities, including people with cerebral palsy. All studies addressed adolescents or adults of normal intelligence. A. Social and sexual relationships: In social relationships adolescents and young adults with cerebral palsy were less active than their age mates, and dating was often delayed and less frequent. Adolescents with congenital disabilities indicated that sexuality is an important aspect of their lives, but they experienced difficulties developing a sexual relationship. B. Associated factors: Psychological maladjustment, insufficient self-efficacy and low sexual self-esteem may impair the development of social and sexual relationships. Overprotection in raising children with cerebral palsy and the negative attitudes of other people may have a negative influence on the self-efficacy of people with cerebral palsy. Conclusion: The reviewed studies suggest many factors that may influence the development of social and sexual relationships in adolescents and young adults with cerebral palsy. However, evidence was found only for the personal factors self-efficacy and sexual self-esteem and their interrelationships with the parents' way of raising their children and successful experiences in social situations.},

abstract = {Traditionally, youth with learning, cognitive, and intellectual disabilities (LCID) have not been given the option of participating in and thus benefiting from a postsecondary education. There are school districts and community colleges across the country, however, that are creating opportunities for these youth to have the option of meaningful participation in a postsecondary education while still in secondary school (i.e., Dual Enrollment). The present study involved a national survey of 25 postsecondary education options that support youth with LCID in postsecondary education while still enrolled in secondary school as an empirical foundation for future research on these service models. The main findings indicate that although most programs provide some combination of “life-skills” training and community-based instruction combined with employment training, some innovative service models (i.e., Inclusive Programs) focus primarily on inclusive postsecondary educa- tional services for students with LCID. Inclusive programs tend to be relatively new, to serve fewer individuals than other service models, and are more collaborative (i.e., high schools, colleges and adult service agencies support students). Main survey findings are presented and discussed, followed by detailed profiles of six programs, and recommendations for future research are presented.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the social, intimate and sexual relationships of Dutch adolescents with cerebral palsy compared with their able-bodied age mates. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: A total of 103 adolescents with cerebral palsy without severe learning problems aged 16-20 years. METHODS: We used a structured interview and questionnaires to assess subject characteristics such as age, type of cerebral palsy, gross motor function and level of education. Main outcome measures on social, intimate and sexual relationships are the Life-Habits questionnaire, the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale, and a structured interview developed for Dutch studies in able-bodied persons and persons with spina bifida. Experienced competence was assessed with the Dutch version of the Self-Perception Profile of Adolescents and the Physical Disability Sexual and Body Esteem Scale. These data were compared with matching reference data, mainly from able-bodied (Dutch) adolescents. RESULTS: Approximately 30% of the subjects functioned socially below their age level. Adolescents with cerebral palsy find it difficult to develop intimate relationships and they have less sexual experience than their able-bodied age mates. CONCLUSION: Although adolescents with cerebral palsy do have social relationships, it is difficult for them to develop intimate relationships. They perceive various barriers, but seem to have a positive self-perception.},

Bourdieu's theory has had someapplication in the US (Berger 2000).

abstract = {Research traditionally has focused on the development of individual symptoms in those who experienced trauma directly but has overlooked the interpersonal impact of trauma. The current study reports data from 45 male Army soldiers who recently returned from a military deployment to Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) or Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom) and their female spouses/partners. The results indicated that increased trauma symptoms, particularly sleep problems, dissociation, and severe sexual problems, in the soldiers significantly predicted lower marital/relationship satisfaction for both soldiers and their female partners. The results suggest that individual trauma symptoms negatively impact relationship satisfaction in military couples in which the husband has been exposed to war trauma.

Here we show, by introducing a histidine-to-arginine point mutation at position 101 of the murine alpha1-subunit gene, that alpha1-type GABA(A) receptors, which are mainly expressed in cortical areas and thalamus, are rendered insensitive to allosteric modulation by benzodiazepine-site ligands, whilst regulation by the physiological neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid is preserved. alpha1(H101R) mice failed to show the sedative, amnesic and partly the anticonvulsant action of diazepam. In contrast, the anxiolytic-like, myorelaxant, motor-impairing and ethanol-potentiating effects were fully retained, and are attributed to the nonmutated GABA(A) receptors found in the limbic system (alpha2, alpha5), in monoaminergic neurons (alpha3) and in motoneurons (alpha2, alpha5). Thus, benzodiazepine-induced behavioural responses are mediated by specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes in distinct neuronal circuits, which is of interest for drug design.},

        What is the article about?
        
          

        political participation between african american and caucasian women
          

          
In the literature review and/or conceptual framework, how do authors talk about the relationship between political participation/orientation and life course experiences, and/or the relationship between political participation/orientation and college experiences?
        
          

        the main idea is since the womens rights movement was mostly white women they would be more engaged later on and african american women would see it as less important to them. 
          

          
What interesting thoughts or assertions did authors make in literature review or discussion that we can use in our paper? (e.g., “the need to promote political participation is essential for our democracy,” “those who do not participate politically are likely to have a highly undemocratic view of the world”) Basically think about things we can use for fodder.
        
          

        this brings to light the idea of differences in race/gender of political participation, and although the participants here are from the civil rights era we still may want to look at the effects of gender/race and compare that to previous college generations.
          

          
What variables or concepts relate to political participation?
        
          

        how often people participated in specific political behaviors, on a continous scale of self reports.
          

          
What are the research questions of the study?
        
          

        5 hypothesis taken from the article:
Hypothesis I: At midlife, Black women who were young adults during the social movements of the late 1960s and the early 1970s will report that the civil rights movement had a larger impact on their lives than did the women's movement. Conversely, we expect that White women of this cohort will endorse the women's move- ment as having had a greater impact on their subsequent lives than did the civil rights movement.Hypothesis 2: Level of political participation at midlife will be pre- dicted by student activism for both Black and White women.
Hypothesis 3: High scores on measures tapping the construct of political identity will be associated with midlife political participa- tion in women of both racial groups.
Hypothesis 4: Black women will endorse higher levels of power dis- content than will White women; however, power discontent will be associated with midlife political participation for both groups.
Hypothesis 5: Social responsibility will be related to midlife political participation for both Black and White women.
          

          
What data was used or collected?
        
          

        self-report survey mailed to university of michigan alumni.
          

          
What methodologies were employed?
        
          

        factor analysis and group comparisions, MANOVA.
          

          
IF SEM, describe model they intend to estimate
        
          

        NA
          

          
What findings were relevant to understanding political participation?
        
          

        through groups were found out of the factor analysis, political identity, power discontent and social responsibility,  and thesse were differnet between race groups, also the amount of activism spent, which may relate to political participation.
          

          
What interesting things stated in the discussion can we use for our paper.  Make sure you cite everything.
        
          

        while both groups participated differently in the movement, it had similar moderate effect on their mid-life participation, so race may become less of an issue as time goes on (King, 1988). dispels the myth african american women werent interested in civil rights movement, one interesting quote "It supports, instead, the contention that African American women have a "multiple (political) consciousness" corresponding to the "multiple jeop ardy" they experience as members of two relatively disempowered groups (King, 1988)."

        
          
List citations of other studies that authors reference of regarding the relationship between political participation/orientation and/or the relationship between life course experiences, and/or political participation and college experiences?

Use of multiple levels gives rise to an enormous range of statistical benefits. To aid in understanding these benefits, this article provides an elementary introduction to the conceptual basis for multilevel modelling, beginning with classical frequentist, Bayes, and empirical-Bayes techniques as special cases. The article focuses on the role of multilevel averaging ( shrinkage') in the reduction of estimation error, and the role of prior information in finding good averages.},

@article{Cummings2009,
abstract = {When a study outcome is rare in all strata used for an analysis, the odds ratio estimate of causal effects will approximate the risk ratio; therefore, odds ratios from most case-control studies can be interpreted as risk ratios. However, if a study outcome is common, the odds ratio will be further from 1 than the risk ratio. There is debate regarding the merits of risk ratios compared with odds ratios for the analysis of trials and cohort and cross-sectional studies with common outcomes. Odds ratios are conveniently symmetrical with regard to the outcome definition; the odds ratio for outcome Y is the inverse of the odds ratio for the outcome not Y. Risk ratios lack this symmetry, so it may be necessary to present 1 risk ratio for outcome Y and another for outcome not Y. Risk ratios, but not odds ratios, have a mathematical property called collapsibility; this means that the size of the risk ratio will not change if adjustment is made for a variable that is not a confounder. Because of collapsibility, the risk ratio, assuming no confounding, has a useful interpretation as the ratio change in average risk due to exposure among the exposed. Because odds ratios are not collapsible, they usually lack any interpretation either as the change in average odds or the average change in odds (the average odds ratio).},

@article{ORBACH1982,
abstract = {The efficiency of induced self-esteem in reducing various deficits caused by learned helplessness was tested in this study. Sixty undergraduate students were divided into three equal groups. The first group received uncontrollability treatment, the second received controllability treatment, and the third received no treatment. The subjects in the first two groups were asked to reduce the anxiety reaction of a confederate, as shown on an oscilloscope, by talking to him. The anxiety waves were shown on the oscilloscope and were preprogrammed so that subjects in the uncontrollability treatment group experienced lack of control over the results, while the ones in the controllability group were led to belive that they successfully controlled the changes of the confederate's anxiety. Then, half of the subjects in each of the three groups received positive feedback on their personality, while the other half received no feedback. In the last phase all subjects participated in a word recognition task using a tachistoscope operated by a combined push-button and microphone device. Response latency, number of correct identifications, and persistence in the task were recorded. In addition, the subjects completed a mood scale. The results indicate that subjects who received induced self-esteem treatment showed significantly more deficit reversal as reflected in response latency, persistence, feelings of potency, and sadness. The results are discussed in relation to (a) the assumption regarding the similarities between learned helplessness and depression, and (b) the usefulness of induced self-esteem as a form of treatment for helplessness depression.},

We advance this work by distinguishing theoretically a concern for others in general (altruism) from a concern for others in certain groups (social identification). We posit that both concerns generate increased benefits from participation. To test these theories, we use allocations in dictator games towards an unidentified anonymous recipient and two recipients identified only as a registered Democrat or a registered Republican. These allocations permit a distinction between altruism and social identification. The results show that both altruism and social identification significantly increase political participation. The results also demonstrate the usefulness of incorporating benefits that stem from sources beyond material self-interest into rational choice models of participation.},

There were no significant differences in the extent of treatment discrimination experienced by individuals with and without disabilities. The current study also explored the level of job satisfaction reported by currently employed respondents with and without physical disabilities. Results indicated that access discrimination significantly reduced current job satisfaction, and, when it was statistically controlled, individuals with disabilities reported marginally higher levels of job satisfaction than individuals without physical disabilities.

This avoids the problem that the model you select depends upon the order in which variable selection and outlier identification are carried out. Our method can find multiple outliers and appears to be successful in identifying masked outliers. We also address the problem of model uncertainty via Bayesian model averaging. For problems where the number of models is large, we suggest a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to approximate the Bayesian model average over the space of all possible variables and outliers under consideration. Software for implementing this approach is described. In an example, we show that model averaging via simultaneous variable selection and outlier identification improves predictive performance and provides more accurate prediction intervals as compared to any single model that might reasonably be selected.},

Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression models can be used to account for excess zeros in count data. We propose an extension of the ZIP model that is appropriate for longitudinal data. Our extension includes a non stationary, observation-driven time series model based correlation structure. We discuss estimation of the model parameters and the inefficiency of the estimators when the correlation structure is mis-specified. The model's application to the analysis of health care utilization data is also discussed.},

@article{MAAS2004,
abstract = {A crucial problem in the statistical analysis of hierarchically structured data is the dependence of the observations at the lower levels. Multilevel modeling programs account for this dependence and in recent years these programs have been widely accepted. One of the major assumptions of the tests of significance used in the multilevel programs is normality of the error distributions involved. Simulations were used to assess how important this assumption is for the accuracy of multilevel parameter estimates and their standard errors. Simulations varied the number of groups, the group size, and the intraclass correlation, with the second level residual errors following one of three non-normal distributions. In addition asymptotic maximum likelihood standard errors are compared to robust (Huber/White) standard errors. The results show that non-normal residuals at the second level of the model have little or no effect on the parameter estimates. For the fixed parameters, both the maximum likelihood-based standard errors and the robust standard errors are accurate. For the parameters in the random part of the model, the maximum likelihood-based standard errors at the lowest level are accurate, while the robust standard errors are often overcorrected. The standard errors of the variances of the level-two random effects are highly inaccurate, although the robust errors do perform better than the maximum likelihood errors. For good accuracy, robust standard errors need at least 100 groups. Thus, using robust standard errors as a diagnostic tool seems to be preferable to simply relying on them to solve the problem.},

abstract = {Determining the importance of independent variables is of practical relevance to ecologists and managers concerned with allocating limited resources to the management of natural systems. Although techniques that identify explanatory variables having the largest influence on the response variable are needed to design management actions effectively, the use of various indices to evaluate variable importance is poorly understood. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compared six different indices commonly used to evaluate variable importance; zero-order correlations, partial correlations, semipartial correlations, standardized regression coefficients, Akaike weights, and independent effects. We simulated four scenarios to evaluate the indices under progressively more complex circumstances that included correlation between explanatory variables, as well as a spurious variable that was correlated with other explanatory variables, but not with the dependent variable. No index performed perfectly under all circumstances, but partial correlations and Akaike weights performed poorly in all cases. Zero-order correlations was the only measure that detected the presence of a spurious variable, whereas only independent effects assigned overlap areas correctly once the spurious variable was removed. We therefore recommend using zero-order correlations to eliminate predictor variables with correlations near zero, followed by the use of independent effects to assign overlap areas and rank variable importance.},

abstract = {Subjectivism has become the dominant philosophical foundation for Bayesian inference. Yet in practice, most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called noninformative priors, that is, priors constructed by some formal rule. We review the plethora of techniques for constructing such priors and discuss some of the practical and philosophical issues that arise when they are used. We give special emphasis to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his viewpoint about the interpretation of priors, away from unique representation of ignorance toward the notion that they should be chosen by convention. We conclude that the problems raised by the research on priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may not be dismissed lightly: When sample sizes are small (relative to the number of parameters being estimated), it is dangerous to put faith in any default solution; but when asymptotics take over, Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain reasonable choices. We also provide an annotated bibliography.},

annote = {From NLTS2, the results show many individuals with disabilities will go on to college and the plurality chooses community colleges or two year schools. Most will choose academic than vocational programs. Employment was positive with many individuals with disabilities having jobs, receiving benefits, and enjoying their work. The study also looks at different disabilities and the interaction with the community and employment in comparison to individuals in the general population. 

        
Receiving appropriate supports and accommodations in postsecondary programs has been shown to be related to school success and retention for students with disabilities (Mull, Sitlington, and Alper 2001; Pierangelo and Crane 1997; Stodden and Dowrick 2000; Stodden, Jones, and Chang 2002).

        
Many adults consider employment a central component of their lives (Levinson andPalmer 2005). Employment has been linked to a range of positive outcomes, including economic independence and enhanced self-esteem (Fabian 1992; Lehman et al. 2002; Polak and Warner 1996).

@article{min2005random,
abstract = {For count responses, the situation of excess zeros (relative to what standard models allow) often occurs in biomedical and sociological applications. Modeling repeated measures of zero-inflated count data presents special challenges. This is because in addition to the problem of extra zeros, the correlation between measurements upon the same subject at different occasions needs to be taken into account. This article discusses random effect models for repeated measurements on this type of response variable. A useful model is the hurdle model with random effects, which separately handles the zero observations and the positive counts. In maximum likelihood model fitting, we consider both a normal distribution and a nonparametric approach for the random effects. A special case of the hurdle model can be used to test for zero inflation. Random effects can also be introduced in a zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial model, but such a model may encounter fitting problems if there is zero deflation at any settings of the explanatory variables. A simple alternative approach adapts the cumulative logit model with random effects, which has a single set of parameters for describing effects. We illustrate the proposed methods with examples.},

First, it allows researchers to incorporate prior information into the mediation analysis, thus potentially improving the efficiency of estimates. Second, under the Bayesian mediation analysis, inference is straightforward and exact, which makes it appealing for studies with small samples. Third, the Bayesian approach is conceptually simpler for multilevel mediation analysis. Simulation studies and analysis of 2 data sets are used to illustrate the proposed methods.

It focuses on findings from interviews conducted with 24 children, aged 6 to 19, who had disabled siblings, exploring their perceptions of impairment, disability and difference. Most were very aware of their sibling's impairment but the majority did not see that as making their siblings different. Where difference was perceived, this was sometimes attributed to their siblings' experience of disability—unequal treatment and the hostile attitudes of others. Most children saw their disabled sibling as holding various identities and their shared biographies, as members of the same family, may have taken precedence over any perceived differences.

        What is the article about?
        
          

        looking at higher education content to see if it will predict political participation.
          

          
In the literature review and/or conceptual framework, how do authors talk about the relationship between political participation/orientation and life course experiences, and/or the relationship between political participation/orientation and college experiences?
        
          

        the author uses the civic engagement hypothesis, arguing the more poeple learn about politics the more they will become engaged in the political process and accept democratic principles. the more education a person gets the more they will understand teh system and the costs of political partiicpation go down.
          

          
What interesting thoughts or assertions did authors make in literature review or discussion that we can use in our paper? (e.g., “the need to promote political participation is essential for our democracy,” “those who do not participate politically are likely to have a highly undemocratic view of the world”) Basically think about things we can use for fodder.
        
          

        this gives some evdience to our argument that majors (or content areas) may be relevant to future political partiicpation.
          

          
What variables or concepts relate to political participation?
        
          

        many control variables, but the numer of credits in business, science and education, whether they have an advanced degree, political interest. also verbal SAT scores help understand intellectual performance, 
          

          
What are the research questions of the study?
        
          

        does what you study and your intellectual abilities affect political participation.
          

          
What data was used or collected?
        
          

        B&B
          

          
What methodologies were employed?
        
          

        logistic regression, for whether voted or not, and whether they participated in political activites
          

          
IF SEM, describe model they intend to estimate
        
          

        NA
          

          
What findings were relevant to understanding political participation?
        
          

        intellect is not related to political participation, but social science credits, humanitities credit in college are positively related, business and science are negatively related to political participation. post college political interest is related. whether voting or not, none of the majors except social science and education are related. 
          

          
What interesting things stated in the discussion can we use for our paper.  Make sure you cite everything.
        
          

        those in social sciences and humanities were more likely to partiicpate incommunity service, vote, discuss politics and participate in politics right after college.
          

          
List citations of other studies that authors reference of regarding the relationship between political participation/orientation and/or the relationship between life course experiences, and/or political participation and college experiences?

Average grade earned in high school enters first, accounting for 19% of the variance in GPA. Self-control enters second, and SAT third; these account for 9% and 5% of the variance, respectively. No other predictors accounted for substantial portions of variance. This pattern of results converges with findings reported by other investigators using other measures of personality. It was recommended that the global trait of self-control or conscientiousness be systematically assessed and used in college admissions decisions.},

abstract = {College student spiritual development constitutes an important, yet understudied topic in higher education research. In particular, very little is known about whether and how this development varies among students from diverse religious backgrounds. Using a longitudinal sample of 14,527 students from 136 institutions, the current study explored the degree to which spiritual development is related to the religious affiliations of students and the type of colleges and universities they attend. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses demonstrate numerous differences between students who identify with religious majority groups (e.g., Lutherans, Methodists), religious minority groups (e.g., Muslims, Seventh Day Adventists), and no religion at all. In most instances, the presence of individual differences in spiritual development depends upon the religious affiliation of the institution. Moreover, several college experiences are positively associated with spiritual development. Implications for higher education practitioners and administrators are discussed.},

-- Research questions
        
First, how are religious minority status and insti- tutional type related to spiritual development?

        What is the article about?
        
          

        what is the effect on high school community service on political participation.
          

          
In the literature review and/or conceptual framework, how do authors talk about the relationship between political participation/orientation and life course experiences, and/or the relationship between political participation/orientation and college experiences?
        
          

        community service hours in high school may affect political participation later in life.
          

          
What interesting thoughts or assertions did authors make in literature review or discussion that we can use in our paper? (e.g., “the need to promote political participation is essential for our democracy,” “those who do not participate politically are likely to have a highly undemocratic view of the world”) Basically think about things we can use for fodder.
        
          

        similar to other articles, that civic engagement in high school will lead to greater political partiicpation later in life, justifying a life course perspective but starting earlier than our data allows us to.
          

          
What variables or concepts relate to political participation?
        
          

        local voting, president voting, civic volunteer, youth volunteer
          

          
What are the research questions of the study?
        
          

        effect of civic knowledge, community service, and extracurricular participation on adult civic participation.
          

          
What data was used or collected?
        
          

        NELS:88
          

          
What methodologies were employed?
        
          

        logistic regression on each of the four categories.
          

          
IF SEM, describe model they intend to estimate
        
          

        NA
          

          
What findings were relevant to understanding political participation?
        
          

        service frquency wasnt relevant but volunteer service, mixed service, and required service were related to voting, all types of service were related to presidential election year voting, service frequency and mixed service were significant to volunteering, and all except required servic was related to youth volunteering (see tables 2-5 for results). voluntary service, mixed and required service were predictive of civic knowledge.

        
          
What interesting things stated in the discussion can we use for our paper.  Make sure you cite everything.
        
          

        community service may be more important than we thought and this effect may start earlier in life and we just may not be able to test it. extra curricular activities and community service lead to higher rates of viting and volunteering.

@article{Rothmann2003,
abstract = {For many indications where there is an effective standard therapy, active controlled trials are generally conducted when it is unethical to use a placebo. The efficacy objective of most such trials is the demonstration that the experimental therapy has superior efficacy to the active-control. The efficacy objective of a non-inferiority trial may be to rule out that the experimental treatment loses some prespecified fraction of the active-control effect. The size of the active-control effect may be based on previous trials comparing this active-control with a placebo-for example, through a meta-analysis. Delta-method 95% confidence interval procedures are among the testing procedures that have been proposed to test a non-inferiority hypothesis that an experimental treatment retains more than some prespecified fraction of the active-control effect. For time-to-event endpoints using hazard ratios, we will examine the type I error probability of such testing procedures under the assumption that the current active-control effect has been correctly modeled. Conditions are discussed for when such testing procedures maintain a desired approximate type I error rate and when such testing procedures will not. Two applications (one in Cardiorenalogy and one in Oncology) are given-one maintains the desired approximate type I error probability and the other does not. The delta-method 95% confidence interval procedures will also be contrasted with Fieller 95% confidence intervals. Testing based on Fieller 95% confidence intervals will maintain a desired approximate type I error rate. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This paper builds on the work of Sol Levine to examine a disability paradox: Why do many people with serious and persistent disabilities report that they experience a good or excellent quality of life when to most external observers these individuals seem to live an undesirable daily existence? The paper uses a qualitative approach to develop an explanation of this paradox using semi-structured interviews with 153 persons with disabilities. 54.3% of the respondents with moderate to serious disabilities reported having an excellent or good quality of life confirming the existence of the disability paradox. Analysis of the interviews reveals that for both those who report that they have a good and those who say they have a poor quality of life, quality of life is dependent upon finding a balance between body, mind and spirit in the self and on establishing and maintaining an harmonious set of relationships within the person's social context and external environment. A theoretical framework is developed to express these relationships. The findings are discussed for those with and without disabilities and directions are given for future research.},

abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is arguably the most widely used approach to hypothesis evaluation among behavioral and social scientists. It is also very controversial. A major concern expressed by critics is that such testing is misunderstood by many of those who use it. Several other objections to its use have also been raised. In this article the author reviews and comments on the claimed misunderstandings as well as on other criticisms of the approach, and he notes arguments that have been advanced in support of NHST. Alternatives and supplements to NHST are considered, as are several related recommendations regarding the interpretation of experimental data. The concluding opinion is that NHST is easily misunderstood and misused but that when applied with good judgment it can be an effective aid to the interpretation of experimental data.},

abstract = {This research examines potential psychosocial predictors of freshman academic achievement and retention. College students were assessed on various dimensions, (i.e., demographics, prior academic record, smoking, drinking, health-related quality of life, social support, coping) during the first week of their freshman year, and at the beginning of the next academic year. A multiple linear regression equation predicting cumulative GPA using 10 predictors accounted for 56% of the variance in academic achievement while a logistic equation predicting retention rates was not statistically significant. The amount of variance accounted for in first year cumulative GPA (56%) represents a substantial improvement in prediction over using highschool GPA and SAT scores alone (25%; Wolfe &amp; Johnson, 1995). However, similar to past research, some health and psychosocial variables (e.g., smoking, drinking, health-related quality of life, social support, and maladaptive coping strategies) were related to retention. This model may be used as a tool to proactively identify students at high risk for poor academic performance during their freshman year and to provide direction regarding proactive intervention strategies for maladaptive behaviors predictive of poor academic performance (e.g., smoking, binge-drinking, social support, coping).

abstract = {Method: This study examined the association between marijuana-related problems and social norms, impulsivity, and perceived use utility among 292 college students. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to simultaneously predict expected nonusers as well as predict counts of reported marijuana-related problems among expected users. Gender, social norms, impulsivity, and perceived use utility were used to predict expected nonusers as well as number of marijuana-related problems among expected users. Results: Only social norms were associated with the prediction of zero-values. In contrast, only perceived use utility was associated with the prediction of number of marijuana-related problems. Conclusions: Results generally are consistent with theories of the differential association of social-environmental and biopsychological variables with use and problems, respectively. Zero-inflated regression models are a useful strategy to examine risk behaviors with low base rates.},

abstract = {Although several psychological theories predict that members of stigmatized groups should have low global self-esteem, empirical research typically does not support this prediction. It is proposed here that this discrepancy may be explained by considering the ways in which membership in a stigmatized group may protect the self-concept. It is proposed that members of stigmatized groups may (a) attribute negative feedback to prejudice against their group, (b) compare their outcomes with those of the ingroup, rather than with the relatively advantaged outgroup, and (c) selectively devalue those dimensions on which their group fares poorly and value those dimensions on which their group excels. Evidence for each of these processes and their consequences for self-esteem and motivation is reviewed. Factors that moderate the use of these strategies and implications of this analysis for treatment of stigmas are also discussed.},

@article{Brzezinski2005,
abstract = {Exogenous melatonin reportedly induces drowsiness and sleep, and may ameliorate sleep disturbances, including the nocturnal awakenings associated with old age. However, existing studies on the soporific efficacy of melatonin have been highly heterogeneous in regard to inclusion and exclusion criteria, measures to evaluate insomnia, doses of the medication, and routes of administration. We reviewed and analyzed (by meta-analysis) available information on effects of exogenous melatonin on sleep. A MEDLINE search (1980 to December 2003) provided English-language articles, supplemented by personal files maintained by the authors. The analysis used information derived from 17 different studies (involving 284 subjects) that satisfied inclusion criteria. Sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, and sleep efficiency were selected as the outcome measures. The study effect size was taken to be the difference between the response on placebo and the mean response on melatonin for each outcome measured. Melatonin treatment significantly reduced sleep onset latency by 4.0 min (95% CI 2.5, 5.4); increased sleep efficiency by 2.2% (95% CI 0.2, 4.2), and increased total sleep duration by 12.8 min (95% CI 2.9, 22.8). Since 15 of the 17 studies enrolled healthy subjects or people with no relevant medical condition other than insomnia, the analysis was also done including only these 15 studies. The sleep onset results were changed to 3.9 min (95% CI (2.5, 5.4)); sleep efficiency increased to 3.1% (95% CI (0.7, 5.5)); sleep duration increased to 13.7 min (95% CI (3.1, 24.3)).},

abstract = {Objective: To examine the associations and predictors of posttraumatic stress among individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI) in the framework of a Person x Disability x Traumatic Event model. Design: An exploratory study involving analyses of variance, correlations, and a hierarchical multiple regression of a cross-sectional sample. Participants: Three hundred twelve individuals with SCI using a veteran or a civilian SCI clinic. Main Outcome Measures: Purdue Posttraumatic Stress Disorder--Revised scale (PPTSD-R). Results: Four out of all the examined variables had significant regression coefficients: spiritual-religious coping, pain level, severity of SCI, and number of traumatic events. Severity of SCI was a significant predictor, but data suggested that severity of SCI had a curvilinear association with both total posttraumatic stress levels and hyperarousal scores. Conclusion: Treatment of an individual's pain may reduce posttraumatic stress symptoms. Clinicians also can evaluate for previous trauma unrelated to the onset of the SCI and can intervene with the goal of reducing the impact of previous trauma on the individual's present emotional state and reactions to SCI.

abstract = {Negative social exchanges have been more reliably related to psychological health than have positive social exchanges. Little research, however, has sought to understand how underlying appraisal processes link such exchanges to psychological health. This study examined the frequencies of occurrence and appraisals of four parallel domains of positive and negative exchanges in relation to positive well-being and psychological distress in a national sample of 916 older adults. Structural equation analyses revealed that negative exchanges were related both to less well-being and greater psychological distress, whereas positive exchanges were related only to positive well-being. Furthermore, results supported a process in which appraisals mediated the link between social exchanges and psychological health. This social appraisal process helps explain the disproportionate impact of negative exchanges on psychological health.},

A total of 98 graduate students participated in this study. A conjoint measurement of 38 cards (representing people with varying disability type, gender, ethnicity, age, education, and employment status) was used. The authors found that (a) disability-related factors were heavily involved in the preference-making process, (b) attitude or preference formation was also significantly affected by other client characteristics unrelated to disability, and (c) factors influencing attitude/preference formation were similar across the three social contexts. Conjoint analysis could increase our ability to understand factors contributing to the formation of attitudes/preferences in multiple social contexts.

abstract = {Context Hypochondriasis is a chronic, distressing, and disabling condition that is prevalent in ambulatory medical practice. Until recently, no specific treatment has been clearly demonstrated to be effective. Objective To assess the efficacy of a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for hypochondriasis. Design A randomized, usual care control group design, conducted between September 1997 and November 2001. The individual primary care physician was the unit of randomization, and all patients clustered within each physician's practice were assigned to the experimental treatment (individual CBT and a consultation letter to the primary care physician) or to the control condition. Subjects were assessed immediately before and 6 and 12 months after the completion of treatment. Setting and Participants Participants were 80 patients from primary care practices and 107 volunteers responding to public announcements, all of whom exceeded a predetermined cutoff score on a hypochondriasis self-report questionnaire on 2 successive occasions. Intervention A scripted, 6-session, individual CBT intervention was compared with medical care as usual. The CBT was accompanied by a consultation letter sent to the patient's primary care physician. Main Outcome Measures Hypochondriacal beliefs, fears, attitudes, and somatic symptoms; role function and impairment. Results A total of 102 individuals were assigned to CBT and 85 were assigned to medical care as usual. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were similar at baseline. Using an intent-to-treat analytic strategy, a consistent pattern of statistically and clinically significant treatment effects was found at both 6- and 12-month follow-up, adjusting for baseline covariates that included educational level, generalized psychiatric distress, and participant status (patient vs volunteer). At 12-month follow-up, CBT patients had significantly lower levels of hypochondriacal symptoms, beliefs, and attitudes (P<.001) and health-related anxiety (P = .009). They also had significantly less impairment of social role functioning (P = .05) and intermediate activities of daily living (P<.001). Hypochondriacal somatic symptoms were not improved significantly by treatment. Conclusion This brief, individual CBT intervention, developed specifically to alter hypochondriacal thinking and restructure hypochondriacal beliefs, appears to have significant beneficial long-term effects on the symptoms of hypochondriasis.},

abstract = {Many colleges speak of the importance of increasing student retention. Many even invest substantial resources in programs to achieve that end. Witness, for instance, the growth of the freshman seminar. Some institutions even go so far as to hire retention consultants who promise significant gains in retention if only you use their programs. But while many colleges have adopted a variety of programs to enhance retention, most programs are add-ons that are marginal to the academic life of the institution. Too many colleges have adopted what Parker Palmer calls the add a course strategy. Need to address the issue of diversity? Add a course in diversity studies. Need to address the success of new students? Add a freshman seminar. Need to address student retention? Bring in a consultant and establish a committee or office charged with that responsibility. The result is a growing segmentation of services for students into increasingly autonomous fiefdoms whose functional responsibilities are reinforced by separate budget and promotion systems. Therefore, while it is true that retention programs abound on our campuses, most institutions, in my view, have not taken student retention seriously. They have done little to change the way they organize their activities, done little to alter student experience, and therefore done little to address the deeper roots of student attrition. As a result, most efforts at enhancing student retention, though successful to some degree, have had more limited impact than they should or could.},

abstract = {Abstract. Chronic childhood illness, disability, and psychosocial problems are receiving major attention in current pediatric care. Much of the evidence associating chronic physical problems and mental health and adjustment problems has come from clinic-based studies and is often inconsistent in its conclusions. This paper reports the findings of the Ontario Child Health Study, an epidemiologic survey of 3,294 children 4 to 16 years of age in the general community, concerning the relationship of psychiatric disorders and social adjustment problems among children with chronic illness, medical conditions, and long-term disability in contrast to children free of chronic physical health problems. Age- and sex-adjusted risks for psychiatric disorders and social problems, compared with those for healthy peers, were calculated: children with both chronic illness and associated disability were at greater than threefold risk for psychiatric disorders and considerable risk for social adjustment problems. Children with chronic medical conditions, but no disability, were at considerably less risk: about a twofold increase in psychiatric disorders but little increased risk for social adjustment problems was observed. A relative underuse of specialized mental health services by children who might benefit supports the opinion that all physicians in the community who care for children with chronic health problems should become skilled in the recognition of existing or incipient mental health and social problems and familiar with preventive and treatment approaches that may lessen the excessive burden of psychosocial problems among those with chronic ill-health.

abstract = {Most large-scale secondary data sets used in higher education research (e.g., NPSAS or BPS) are constructed using complex survey sample designs where the population of interest is stratified on a number of dimensions and oversampled within certain of these strata. Moreover, these complex sample designs often cluster lower level units (e.g., students) within higher level units (e.g., colleges) to achieve efficiencies in the sampling process. Ignoring oversampling (unequal probability of selection) in complex survey designs presents problems when trying to make inferences—data from these designs are, in their raw form, admittedly nonrepresentative of the population to which they are designed to generalize. Ignoring the clustering of observations in these sampling designs presents a second set of problems when making inferences about variability in the population and testing hypotheses and usually leads to an increased likelihood of committing Type I errors (declaring something as an effect when in fact it is not). This article presents an extended example using complex sample survey data to demonstrate how researchers can address problems associated with oversampling and clustering of observations in these designs.},

Comparison of findings among 93 patients disclosed a moderate level of agreement (r = 0.44-0.63) between the scales, providing limited evidence that a single construct is being measured by each. The questionnaires were more strongly related to each other than to psychosocial scales, which suggests that findings are distinguishable from distress. However, higher distress was significantly associated with greater reports of disability. This was most discernible in the form of more enduring characteristics that may reflect neuroticism. These findings allow modest support for the construct validity of the four questionnaires and suggest a need for caution with their use because persistently negative affect may be a biasing factor.},

However, student veterans entering college today have a unique set of qualities and experiences. As an emerging student population, little is known about the experiences and perceptions these student veterans bring with them to college (DiRamio, Ackerman, & Mitchell, 2008). This study explored the nature of contemporary student veteran transition experiences from military life to college life to uncover (a) the factors that had positive effects on the contemporary student veteran transition process, and (b) the factors that posed challenges to the contemporary student veteran transition process. The information presented in this study has significance as it fills a knowledge gap that in existing literature regarding transitional experiences and perceptions of contemporary student veterans. In addition, the findings may serve as a foundation to improve the quality of resources available for those working to serve the needs of this growing student population.},

@article{Amemiya1981,
abstract = {ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT developments in econometrics in the past ten years has occurred in the area of qualitative response models, henceforth to be abbreviated as QR models, also known as quantal, categorical, or discrete models. In these statistical models the endogenous random variables take only discrete values. In this paper I will present what I consider to be the basic facts about QR models. I believe that QR models are so important in economics that every applied researcher should acquire at least a cursory knowledge of these facts. I will start with the discussion of the simplest model-the model for a univariate dichotomous dependent variable (Section 2), and then move on to multi-response (some say multinomial or polychotomous) and multivariate (meaning more than one discrete dependent variable) models (Sections 3 and 4). Most of Section 2, except 2.C, is rudimentary. Sections 2.C, 3, and 4 are novel, not in the sense that I obtain new results but that I organize results in my own way and give a critical evaluation. I will pay attention to the following three problems: (1) how to specify a model which is consistent with economic theory and which is at the same time statistically manageable, (2) how to estimate and test hypotheses on the parameters of a model, and (3) what criteria to use for choosing among competing models. Topic (2) is discussed in Sections 2.B and 3.A. The reader who finds these sections too technical may skip them without affecting the understanding of the other sections. The reader should bear in mind that the field is still growing and there are still many unsolved issues in each of the three categories above-especially, (1) and (3). The discussion of each topic will be illustrated by examples taken from the aforementioned list of references. My major aim in writing this survey has been to present a critical evaluation of a large number of multi-response and multivariate QR models, which have been proposed in the biometr...

Most geneticists are taught classical statistics, which includes hypothesis testing, estimation and the construction of confidence intervals; this framework has proved more than satisfactory in many ways. What does a Bayesian framework have to offer geneticists? Its utility lies in offering a more direct approach to some questions and the incorporation of prior information. It can also provide a more straightforward interpretation of results. The utility of a Bayesian perspective, especially for complex problems, is becoming increasingly clear to the statistics community; geneticists are also finding this framework useful and are increasingly utilizing the power of this approach.},

Canonical analysis for the female students yielded significant results that were generally consistent with theoretical expectations. Hypothesized characteristics of insecure attachment and 2 dimensions of maladaptive family structure—parental marital conflict and perceived family anxiety concerning separation—were associated with difficulties in social competence and the presence of psychological symptoms. For male students the results of the canonical analysis were not significant. The findings suggest that for college women close parental attachments are adaptive when combined with a family structure that supports individuation.

Because of increased accessibility, attitudes more strongly predicted future behavior when participants had direct experience with the attitude object and reported their attitudes frequently. Because of the resulting attitude stability, the attitude-behavior association was strongest when attitudes were confident, when participants formed their attitude on the basis of behavior-relevant information, and when they received or were induced to think about one- rather than two-sided information about the attitude object.

It is still not clear what methods, practices and types of contact are most likely to promote positive attitudes in children toward disabled peers and disability generally. AIMS: To consider two theoretical models of inter-group contact, both claiming to identify precursors for generalised attitude change, in relation to the attitudes of non-disabled children toward disabled peers as a function of different classroom contact. SAMPLE: Participants were 256 non-disabled school children aged 5-11 years (128 girls and 128 boys). METHODS: Measures of sociometric preference and the evaluation of psychological and physical attributes were used to ascertain children's perceptions of known and unknown peers with disabilities. RESULTS: A relationship was found between the type of contact the children had with disabled peers, and their perceptions of psychological and physical attributes (stereotypes) of groups of unknown disabled and non-disabled peers. CONCLUSIONS: Results show generalisation of stereotypic attitude/judgments from one type of disability to another as a consequence of the two types of contact situation. Findings have important implications for integrating disabled children into mainstream.},

The social and quality of life problems arising from a diagnosis of epilepsy can represent greater challenges than are warranted by its clinical severity. The relationship between stigma and impaired quality of life is well documented.

@article{Sahu2011,
abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Bayesian space-time modeling of daily maximum eight-hour average ozone concentration levels. Hierarchical models based on well known time series modeling methods such as the dynamic linear models (DLM) and the auto-regressive (AR) models are often used in the literature. The DLM, developed as a result of the popularity of Kalman filtering methods, provide a dynamical state-space system that is thought to evolve from a pair of state and observation equations. The AR models, on the other hand, cast in a Bayesian hierarchical setting, have recently been developed through a pair of models where a measurement error model is formulated at the top level and an AR model for the true ozone concentration levels is postulated at the next level. Each of the modeling scenarios is set in an appropriate multivariate setting to model the spatial dependence. This paper compares these two methods in hierarchical Bayesian settings. A simplified skeletal version of the DLM taken from Dou et al. (2009) is compared theoretically with a matching hierarchical AR model. The comparisons reveal many important differences in the induced space-time correlation structures. Further comparisons of the variances of the predictive distributions by conditioning on different sets of data for each model show superior performances of the AR models under certain conditions. These theoretical investigations are followed-up by a simulation study and a real data example implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for modeling daily maximum eight-hour average ozone concentration levels observed in the state of New York in the months of July and August, 2006. The hierarchical AR model is chosen by all the model choice criteria considered in this example.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

@article{Nowicki2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Past research has shown that children can be biased against peers with disabilities, but the association of attitudes with gender, age and disability preferences, as well as interactions between these variables, are unclear. The objectives of this study were to examine these issues in a cross-sectional, split-plot study to clarify: (1) if elementary school children's attitudes towards peers with disabilities are related to age, gender and type of disability; (2) if interactions between these variables exist; and (3) if convergent validity could be achieved across three theoretically linked dependent variables. METHODS: One hundred elementary school children between 4 and 10 years old were assessed for attitudes towards target children with no disability, a physical or an intellectual disability, and a combined intellectual/physical disability. Measures were completed in an interview format. RESULTS: Attitudes towards a target child with physical disabilities and a target child without disabilities did not differ. There was a significant interaction for age and disability. Attitudes towards target children with intellectual and intellectual/physical disabilities were negatively biased, and were negatively associated with age. Results were consistent across measures except for a main effect of gender in one measure and a gender by age interaction in another. CONCLUSIONS: Children's attitudes appear to be associated with several factors, including age and the presence or absence of disability. Gender differences in attitudes may be because of gender-based response biases rather than disability biases. Because of the multifaceted nature of childhood attitudes, cross-sectional designs with several dependent and independent variables provide an opportunity to examine consistency of results across measures and potential interactions between factors that may not be uncovered when variables are examined in isolation.},

abstract = {The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides that disabled individuals who are otherwise qualified to perform a job cannot be discriminated against because of their disabilities. However, an increasing number of federal court rulings are creating a situation where a plaintiffs impairment must be so severe that the individual is unable to pet-form the job in question in order to be adjudged as disabled. Therefore, if a plaintiff who suffered discrimination is healthy enough to perform the job, he or she is not disabled and cannot sue under the ADA; however, if a plaintiff proves an impairment that is severe enough to be a disability, he or she is not qualified for the job. Either way, the employee-applicant-plaintiff loses. Certain medical conditions are listed that are all serious, chronic impairments that have been involved in case decisions under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. Many other medical conditions may or may not be serious or chronic, such as arthritis, back problems, vision problems, and high blood pressure. These would continue being handled on a case-by-case basis to determine if the condition causes a substantial limitation on a major life activity, but judged as to any limitations imposed under the unmedicated test.},

abstract = {Near-death experiences (NDE) are lucid events that take place when a person is so physically compromised that he would die if its condition does not improve. He is unconscious, without heartbeats and breath, and with a flat-line electroencephalogram. NDE may include some of the following elements: Out of the body experiences or separation of consciousness from the physical body, increase in sensory perception and intense emotions, travel into or through a tunnel, encounter with a brilliant light and mystical beings, deceased relatives or friends, a sense of alteration in time and space, visualization of unworldly realms and a special knowledge, encounter with a barrier or boundary, and a return to the body, either voluntary or involuntary. The fact that children NDE are similar to adult NDE is an evidence that these experiences are real and not due to pre-existing beliefs, cultural influences or previous experiences in the present life. The characteristics of NDE are similar worldwide. No evidence supports the physiological, psychological, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical hypothesis proposed to explain the NDE. Multifactorial models, based on the combination of all of them (brain anoxia or hypoxia, release of serotonin, endorphins and ketamine-like compounds) have also been proposed. Although physiological, psychological, and socio-cultural factors could interact in the NDE, the hypothesis proposed consist essentially in unsupported speculations about what might be happening during the NDE.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the relationship between condom-related protective behavioral strategies (PBS; including those that require active behavior and mental planning) and condom use at both global and event levels. College students (N = 623; 57.8% female) completed self-report measures of condom-related PBS, as well as drinking and sexual behavior. Logistic regression findings indicated that students who reported greater use of condom-related PBS were more likely to discuss their and their partner's HIV status, sexually transmitted infection (STI) history (other than HIV), and protection against STIs (such as HIV and other STIs) the first time they had sex with their most recent vaginal sexual partner. Logistic regression findings also indicated that more frequent use of condom-related PBS was associated with being more likely to use a condom during the most recent vaginal sexual experience. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression results showed that condom-related PBS predicted condom non-users and that condom-related PBS were associated with increased use of condoms during sexual behavior in the previous three months. These results extend prior research by demonstrating that both active and mental planning condom-related PBS are associated with condom use at both the global and event levels, which suggests that condom-related PBS may be useful to incorporate in interventions targeting risky sexual behavior among young adults.},

abstract = {One important component of model selection using generalized linear models (GLM) is the choice of a link function. We propose using approximate Bayes factors to assess the improvement in fit over a GLM with canonical link when a parametric link family is used. The approximate Bayes factors are calculated using the Laplace approximations given in [32], together with a reference set of prior distributions. This methodology can be used to differentiate between different parametric link families, as well as allowing one to jointly select the link family and the independent variables. This involves comparing nonnested models and so standard significance tests cannot be used. The approach also accounts explicitly for uncertainty about the link function. The methods are illustrated using parametric link families studied in [12] for two data sets involving binomial responses.},

abstract = {A longitudinal cohort study of 100 people with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) was performed to determine the prevalence and severity of different types of pain (musculoskeletal, visceral, neuropathic at-level, neuropathic below-level) at 5 years following SCI. Prospective data on the characteristics of pain up to 6 months following injury had been collected previously and allowed comparisons between the presence of pain at different time points. In addition, we sought to determine the relationship between the presence of pain and physical factors related to the injury such as level of lesion, completeness and clinical SCI syndrome. We also obtained information regarding mood, global self-rated health and the impact of pain on function. Of the 100 subjects in the original cohort, 73 were available for follow up. When all types of pain were included, 59 of the 73 subjects (81%) reported the presence of pain. Musculoskeletal pain was the most common type of pain experienced and was present in 43 subjects (59%), at-level neuropathic pain was present in 30 subjects (41%), below-level neuropathic pain was present in 25 subjects (34%) and visceral pain was present in four subjects (5%). Overall, 58% reported their pain as severe or excruciating and those with visceral pain were most likely to rate their pain in these categories. There was no relationship between the presence of pain overall and level or completeness of lesion, or type of injury. However, tetraplegics were more likely to report below-level neuropathic pain. This study prospectively demonstrates the differing time courses of different types of pain over the first 5 years following SCI. There was a strong correlation between the presence of both types of neuropathic pain at 5 years and earlier time points but both visceral pain and musculoskeletal pain demonstrated a poor correlation between time points. Chronic visceral pain occurs in a small percentage of patients and does not correlate with the presence of visceral pain early following injury. Those with neuropathic pain early following their injury are likely to continue to experience ongoing pain and the pain is likely to be severe. In contrast, chronic musculoskeletal pain is more common but less likely to be severe and cannot be predicted by the presence of pain in the first 6 months following injury.},

abstract = {For the problem of variable selection for the normal linear model, fixed penalty selection criteria such as AIC, Cp, BIC and RIC correspond to the posterior modes of a hierarchical Bayes model for various fixed hyperparameter settings. Adaptive selection criteria obtained by empirical Bayes estimation of the hyperparameters have been shown by George and Foster [2000. Calibration and Empirical Bayes variable selection. Biometrika 87(4), 731–747] to improve on these fixed selection criteria. In this paper, we study the potential of alternative fully Bayes methods, which instead margin out the hyperparameters with respect to prior distributions. Several structured prior formulations are considered for which fully Bayes selection and estimation methods are obtained. Analytical and simulation comparisons with empirical Bayes counterparts are studied.},

abstract = {A key area left open in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) is the distinction between activity and participation. This paper suggests characteristics to distinguish between the components in the ICF model which explicitly include the relationship of contextual factors to the different components. Ten distinguishing characteristics are presented which fall into three major groups: the construct of the component, individual effects, and contextual influences. Application of these suggests that there are four distinguishable components of functioning, disability, and health, which are labeled body functions and structures, acts, tasks, and societal involvement. The body functions and structures component is the same as the ICF component. Acts, tasks, and societal involvement are sub-components of the combined ICF components of activity and participation. Contextual influences operate both as facilitators or barriers (as suggested in the ICF) and as scene-setters. An enhanced model of the relationship between the components is presented, suggesting that there are reciprocal relationships between contextual factors acting as scene-setters, contextual factors acting as facilitators or barriers, societal involvement, tasks, and acts. Further research is needed to determine to what extent these characteristics can be operationalized to distinguish between items in the ICF combined activity and participation classification.},

abstract = {Successful publication of a research study usually requires a small p value, typically p < 0.05. Many clinicians believe that a p value represents the probability that the null hypothesis is true, so that a small p value means the null hypothesis must be false. In fact, the p value provides very weak evidence against the null hypothesis, and the probability that the null hypothesis is true is usually much greater than the p value would suggest. Moreover, even considering "the probability that the null hypothesis is true" is not possible with the usual statistical setup and requires a different (Bayesian) statistical approach. We describe the Bayesian approach using a well-established diagnostic testing analogy. Then, as a practical example, we compare the p-value result of a study of aprotinin-associated operative mortality with the more illuminative interpretation of the same study data using a Bayesian approach.},

In the ten years since publication of the first edition of this bestselling text, great strides have been made in the development of new methods and in software for generalized linear models and other closely related models.Thoroughly revised and updated, An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition continues to initiate intermediate students of statistics, and the many other disciplines that use statistics, in the practical use of these models and methods. The new edition incorporates many of the important developments of the last decade, including survival analysis, nominal and ordinal logistic regression, generalized estimating equations, and multi-level models. It also includes modern methods for checking model adequacy and examples from an even wider range of application.Statistics can appear to the uninitiated as a collection of unrelated tools. An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models, Second Edition illustrates how these apparently disparate methods are examples or special cases of a conceptually simple structure based on the exponential family of distribution, maximum likelihood estimation, and the principles of statistical modelling.},

abstract = {Increasingly, children with disabling conditions are surviving through childhood into adolescence and beyond. This places increased importance on understanding adolescent, family, and peer relationships, which are critical to healthy development among adolescents in general and to transitions to successful adulthood among youths with physical disabilities in particular. The purpose of this study was to identify the patterns of family and peer interactions. One hundred two youths with spina bifida and 60 adolescents with cerebral palsy between the ages of 12 and 22 completed written psychological measures as well as an in-depth structured interview. Approximately 90% of youths with spina bifida and cerebral palsy resided at home, of whom 80.4% and 72% lived with both parents. Almost without exception, parental relationships were defined as positive, with no difference of attitude noted toward the mother and father. Relationships with parents for teenagers with spina bifida were marked by high levels of dependence on parents for personal care such as bowel programs and, for both groups, low levels of responsibility at home and lack of discussion with parents about sexuality or menstruation. Although friends were viewed as very important by most respondents (approximately 83%), relationships were characterized by extremely limited out-of-school contacts, negligible participation with organized social activities, and a primary orientation toward sedentary activities. Finally, regarding heterosexual relationships, whereas 44.1% of respondents with spina bifida and 54.2% of respondents with cerebral palsy said their friends dated, only 14.7% and 28.3% of study participants indicated that they had ever been on a date and, even for those teenagers, heterosexual social contacts were infrequent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Three theoretical models by which social support may influence the impact of stressful life events on cancer patients' psychological state were tested: 1) the additive model, in which social support and stressful life events each directly influence cancer patients' adjustment, irrespective of the magnitude of the other; 2) the buffering hypothesis, in which stressful events occurring in the presence of social support should produce less distress than if they occur in its absence; and 3) both additive and buffering models. METHODS: One hundred seventy-nine patients who had Stage II breast cancer (median age, 56 yrs; 68% disease free), treated a mean of 6.8 years since entry to Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 8541, were interviewed by telephone concerning their psychosocial adjustment. The following measures were used: Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS), Life Experience Survey (LES) a measure of stressful life events within the past 12 months, European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) a measure of quality of life, Mental Health Inventory (MHI), and the Systems of Belief Inventory (SBI) a measure of spiritual and religious involvement. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that less than excellent levels of social support (P < 0.01), greater negative impact of LES fateful life events (e.g., death of family member) (P < 0.05), personal illness or injury (P < 0.05), and all other negative life events in the past year (< 4; P < 0.01) were significant predictors of greater MHI psychological distress, in addition to being divorced or separated (P < 0.001), and more recently treated for cancer on CALGB 8541 (P < 0.05). The interaction of LES scores with MOS-SSS or SBI social support, used to test the buffering hypothesis, did not significantly improve the prediction of MHI psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the additive model, with both stressful life events and social support independently and significantly affecting patients' emotional state. However, the level of social support needed to be very high to reduce the likelihood of severe psychological distress.},

abstract = {Large, randomized clinical trials ("megatrials") are key drivers of modern cardiovascular practice, since they are cited frequently as the authoritative foundation for evidence-based management policies. Nevertheless, fundamental limitations in the conventional approach to statistical hypothesis testing undermine the scientific basis of the conclusions drawn from these trials. This review describes the conventional approach to statistical inference, highlights its limitations, and proposes an alternative approach based on Bayes' theorem. Despite its inherent subjectivity, the Bayesian approach possesses a number of practical advantages over the conventional approach: 1). it allows the explicit integration of previous knowledge with new empirical data; 2). it avoids the inevitable misinterpretations of p values derived from megatrial populations; and 3). it replaces the misleading p value with a summary statistic having a natural, clinically relevant interpretation-the probability that the study hypothesis is true given the observations. This posterior probability thereby quantifies the likelihood of various magnitudes of therapeutic benefit rather than the single null magnitude to which the p value refers, and it lends itself to graphical sensitivity analyses with respect to its underlying assumptions. Accordingly, the Bayesian approach should be employed more widely in the design, analysis, and interpretation of clinical megatrials.},

This study summarizes three types of HLM-based multilevel mediation models, and then explains that in two types of these models confounding can be produced and erroneous conclusions may be derived when using popularly recommended procedures. A Monte Carlo simulation study illustrates that these procedures can underestimate or overestimate true mediation effects. Recommendations are provided for appropriately testing multilevel mediation and for differentiating within-group versus between-group effects in multilevel settings.},

Women with rheumatoid arthritis completed measures of unmitigated communion, social constraints, and psychological distress at study entry and repeated the distress measure one year later. As expected, unmitigated communion was associated with psychological distress.

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2.�Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3.�Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4.�Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

However, there is little factual information about the services available to these students in campus disability services offices or the extent to which they use these services. This article reports the results of a survey of disability services offices at colleges and universities in 10 states. Data from 275 schools revealed the number of students with psychiatric disabilities seeking assistance from disability services offices, characteristics of these offices, and the types of services they provide. Survey data also identified barriers to full participation of these students in academic settings. Implications of the study are discussed to inform policy and postsecondary institutional practices with the goal of better serving psychiatrically disabled students to maximize their talents and potential.},

Bootstrap tests are powerful because they detect that the sampling distribution of the mediated effect is skewed away from 0. They argue that R. M. Baron and D. A. Kenny's (1986) recommendation of first testing the X Y association for statistical significance should not be a requirement when there is a priori belief that the effect size is small or suppression is a possibility.

The analyses for each of two entry years produced very similar results. The analyses indicated that academic performance was highly related to high school academic grade point average (gpa). After controlling for SAT Verbal and SAT Math scores and high school academic gpa, race and the academic grouping of the student's major were significantly related to academic performance. However, for students of a given race and in a given academic grouping with the same SAT Verbal scores, the same SAT Math scores, and the same high school academic gpas, there was no significant difference in the predicted probability of academic dismissal for (1) men and women students, (2) dormitory and commuter students, and (3) full-time and part-time students.},

annote = {·         What is the article about? The development of political activism over adolescence and its impact on future jobs, political participation. This was a study and not so much about primary data analysis but looking at the role of ethnicity and political participation on later political participation. 
·         In the literature review and/or conceptual framework, how do authors talk about the relationship between political participation/orientation and life course experiences, and/or the relationship between political participation/orientation and college experiences? Political participation was looked through the lens of ethnicity and previous political participation and how political participation at such an early age (high school) can have effects on political participation. 
·         What interesting thoughts or assertions did authors make in literature review or discussion that we can use in our paper? (e.g., “the need to promote political participation is essential for our democracy,” “those who do not participate politically are likely to have a highly undemocratic view of the world”) Basically think about things we can use for fodder. We should look at the idea what happens in college may just be the middle and not the catalyst to future political participation. 
·         What variables or concepts relate to political participation?  voting in elections, protests, rallies.
·         What are the research questions of the study? does identity development play a role in whether or not people begin to identify with political issues or political participation.
·         What data was used or collected?
        
alumni data from a high school from 3 different years of graduates
·         What methodologies were 
employed? descriptive statistics, chi-square tests of independence
·         IF SEM, describe model they intend to estimate  NA
·         What findings were relevant to understanding political participation? political participation can (and does) start earlier in life than college and seemingly unrelated issues like identity development can impact whether people becoming participatory in political issues. The authors argue they become more aware of politics and their role in the political system.
·         What interesting things stated in the discussion can we use for our paper. Make sure you cite everything. Race seems to play an issue with regards to political participations among those who were politically active at a college in the mid 1950-1963. differences were found between protesters and non-protesters (Fendrich, 1993).        
·         List citations of other studies that authors reference of regarding the relationship between political participation/orientation and/or the relationship between life course experiences, and/or political participation and college experiences?

Students with disabilities in their study display many of the characteristics that are recognized as potential risk factors for attrition in higher education. The results from chisquare tests reveal that academic and social integration and disability-related accommodations are significantly associated with first-to-second-year persistence of students with disabilities; however, when controlling for other demographic, entry, and in-college characteristics, they do not hold significant in the final logistic regression model. Among in-college characteristics, on-campus living, full-time enrollment, degree expectations, first-year GPA, and net price of attendance emerge as significant predictors of persistence of students with disabilities. Recommendations for rehabilitation counselors and disability services staff in higher education are provided.},

abstract = {The authors examined the extent to which college student drinkers are at risk for experiencing negative alcohol-related consequences during Spring Break. A sample of first-year college student drinkers (N = 726) participated by completing an online survey assessing typical drinking, as well as Spring Break drinking and related consequences. Findings suggest Spring Break drinking was positively associated with alcohol-related consequences during Spring Break, even after controlling for sex and typical drinking. Furthermore, results indicated that typical drinking moderated the relationship between Spring Break drinking and expected zero-values (i.e., not reporting any Spring Break consequences), such that the association between Spring Break drinking and the likelihood of being a zero-score was less evident for those who are typically lighter drinkers. Identifying and examining temporal and contextually relevant events and associated drinking is critical for understanding and ultimately preventing extreme drinking and associated consequences associated with specific events like Spring Break, which place many students at high risk for experiencing acute harm.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a 2-year mixed methodology (quantitative and qualitative) study examining the reintegration and quality of life of community-residing adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). A convenience sample of 100 individuals with SCI completed three questionnaires for the quantitative study phase. A self-selected subsample of 34 of the participants then attended qualitative focus groups to further explore adjustment to living in the community after SCI. The results revealed that locus of control is crucial to subjective quality of life, productivity status, satisfaction with performance of daily activities and satisfaction with community integration. Respondents confirmed that substantial adjustments are required after SCI, and that these can be aided through education, involvement in productive activity and participation in social and leisure activities. A dominant finding was that social support and peer mentoring were invaluable. Stable health and appropriate pain management were crucial to subjective satisfaction with community integration, yet for many of the respondents these were elusive. Although the participants valued the rehabilitation process, they felt that "the system" was not client-centred and that the timing of services and information was not always relevant to individual needs. The clinical and practical implications of these results are discussed.},

abstract = {Research on faculty productivity fails to account for the hierarchical nature of the data. Faculty members within an academic discipline more closely resemble one another than faculty in other disciplines, resulting in dependent observations and thus inaccurate statistical results. Unlike ordinary least squares, multilevel modeling takes into account this grouping effect. This article analyzes the research productivity of 1,104 tenured/tenure-track faculty from the 1993 NSOPF survey to compare traditional regression models with a random coefficients model. The results indicate a large grouping effect on research productivity, and the statistical as well as the substantive results of the random coefficients model differ significantly from the regression approach.},

abstract = {Using national survey data, multilevel modeling techniques, and descriptive statistics, this study makes an effort to understand the influence of the financial context of institutions on the chance of college completion for low socioeconomic status (SES) students at four-year colleges and universities. This research shows that college completion is positively associated with an institution’s tuition revenue as a percent of total revenue and educational and general expenditures per full-time equivalent student. This study also documents that, compared to high SES students, low SES students are disproportionately enrolled in institutions with lower levels of financial resources and higher dependence on tuition as a source of total revenue. The results of this research have implications for policy with regard to addressing the chances of college completion for low SES students.},
annote = {
        -- A paragraph or two about the nature of paper. Why was the study necessary?
        
Does the financial qualities of an institution affect the kind of students it brings and can help. Low SES students have lower completion rates than their higher SES counterparts.  
          
-- Research questions
        
1. After taking other student- and institution-level variables into account, how does SES influence college completion?2. After taking student- and institution-level variables into account, is there a difference by SES in the chance of college completion?
3. After taking into account student-level and other institution-level variables, do institutional revenue and expenditure patterns help to explain the difference by SES in college completion?

        
          
-- What data were analyzed? Who sponsored the data? Some studies use multiple sources so be clear about what the sources are and where they came from?
        
1996–2001 Beginning Postsecondary Students survey, by NCES.
          
-- What was the sample under study? Be brief here. One or two sentences
        
incoming undergraduates.  
          
-- What was the major outcome variable? Continuous? Dichotomous?
        
having completed a bachelor’s degree program within six years after first enrolling in the same four-year institution, binary variable. 
          
-- What were the student-level predictors? It may be helpful to think of categories (e.g., 
socio-demographic, cognitive functioning, teacher quality, etc.)
        
measures of student background characteristics, college experiences, unmet financial need, hours worked, and working off campus. Student background characteristics include pre-college academic performance, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Racial groups of African American, Hispanic, Asian, and White.
          
-- What were the institutional-level predictors? Be very clear/specific here because we are going to recommend so ways to think about creating level-2 variables here.
        measures of student
        
peer characteristics, structural-demographic characteristics, and financial aspects of a four-year institution. Student peer group characteristics are measured by the percent female, racial/ethnic diversity, and the average SES of full-time freshmen attending the same institution, high selectivity (the SAT score for students in the highest quartile); low selectivity (the SAT score for students in the lowest quartile); and middle selectivity (the SAT score for students in the second and third quartiles).
financial context of a four-year institution is measured by variables reflecting institutional revenues and expenditures. The revenue variables include the following: percent of total revenue from state appropriations; percent of total revenue from tuition; percent of total revenue from competitive grants and contracts; and percent of total revenue from endowments.

        -- What software was used? 
        
unknown  
          
-- What were major findings?
        
HLM5  
          
-- How does this study relate to our article?
        
This is good of we want to look at a dichotomous outcome, using a hierarchial generalized linear model is a way to do it well thats statistically valid.},

Three main points among many were: 
Civic knowledge promotes political participation. All other things being equal, the more knowledge people have, the more likely they are to participate in civic and political affairs. 

        
Civic knowledge helps citizens understand their interests as individuals and as members of groups. There is a rational relationship between one’s interests and particular legislation. The more knowledge we have, the more readily and accurately we connect with and defend our interests in the political process. 

        
Civic knowledge helps citizens learn more about civic affairs. It is difficult to acquire more knowledge unless we have a certain basis of knowledge. The new knowledge we do gain can be effectively used only if we are able to integrate it into an existing framework. 

        
·         What interesting thoughts or assertions did authors make in literature review or discussion that we can use in our paper? (e.g., “the need to promote political participation is essential for our democracy,” “those who do not participate politically are likely to have a highly undemocratic view of the world”) Basically think about things we can use for fodder. education can lead to impacts on political participation, so not only what you do in high school or college but also what you learn will impact your future political participation.
·         What variables or concepts relate to political participation?   Review article, no data analysis
·         What are the research questions of the study?        Review article, no data analysis
·         What data was used or collected?        Review article, no data analysis
·         What methodologies were employed?        Review article, no data analysis
·         IF SEM, describe model they intend to estimate        Review article, no data analysis
·         What findings were relevant to understanding political participation?         no findings from data analysis, just what theories were dicussed above.
·         What interesting things stated in the discussion can we use for our paper. Make sure you cite everything.
        
since the mid 60's, every indicator of civic engagement has fallen by half, political knowledge is way down and more use of internet than tv or newspapers (Olander, 2003).
·         List citations of other studies that authors reference of regarding the relationship between political participation/orientation and/or the relationship between life course experiences, and/or political participation and college experiences?

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS-C) in a sample of 110 patients. Criterion-related and construct validities of the MOS-SSS-C were evaluated by correlations with the Chinese version of the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Survey (r = .82) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (r = -.58). Confirmatory factor analysis affirmed the four-factor structure of the MOS-SSS-C in measuring the functional aspects of perceived social support. Cronbach's alphas for the subscales ranged from .93 to .96, whereas the alpha for the overall scale was .98. The 2-week test-retest reliability of the MOS-SSS-C as measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient was .84. The MOS-SSS-C is a psychometrically sound multidimensional measure for the evaluation of functional aspects of perceived social support by Chinese patients with chronic disease. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {The transition to adulthood is a potentially formative period of the life course for individuals with intellectual disability. In this investigation, we examined the transition using traditional criteria for launching and role functioning and also explored how the concept of emerging adulthood applies to young adults who have intellectual disability. The targets were 140 young adults (ages 18–33 years, mean = 24 years) who participated in a long-term follow-up of a longitudinal investigation of family and child development for children with mild and moderate intellectual disability. Overall, there was limited evidence of launching and financial independence for the young adults, with most living with parents and few able to support themselves financially. As expected, greater progress toward independence occurred for individuals with mild as opposed to moderate intellectual disability. However, relatively few adult outcomes were predicted by childhood behavior problems, and there were few gender differences. Despite this situation, most of the parents reported that the target individual had “reached adulthood” and, similar to normative samples, they focused on criteria for adulthood that emphasized independent thought and free choice over role transitions and financial independence. The findings suggest an expanded view of emerging adulthood for individuals with intellectual disability who are transitioning into adulthood characterized by interdependence rather than independence.},
annote = {Defining adulthood and independence has been an issue for disability since the civil rights movement began. Due to teh fact many can not become financially or physically independent, the definition clearly needs changing. this study shows an emerging definition for those with mild to moderate intellectual disability is grounded more in thought and free choice than financial or physical independence, although this is similar to normative comparison samples. This could be a major point for disability, or a major social change in the interaction between young adults in general, more research is needed.},

@article{Obrien2007,
abstract = {The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and tolerance are both widely used measures of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb most commonly the rule of 10 associated with VIF are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical textbooks). When VIF reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index. These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and find that threshold values of the VIF (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients. Values of the VIF of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analyses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index.},

These models use longitudinal growth modeling techniques to identify effective schools or teachers based upon the results of changes in student achievement test scores. Given their increasing popularity, this article demonstrates how to perform the data analysis necessary to fit a general value-added model using the nlme package available for the R statistics environment. We demonstrate techniques for inspecting the data prior to fitting the model, walk a practitioner through a sample analysis, and discuss general extensions commonly found across the literature that may be incorporated to enhance the basic model presented, including the estimation of multiple outcomes and teacher effects.},

The statistic T$\sim$d is asymptotically equivalent to the scaled difference test statistic T̄(d) introduced in Satorra (2000), which requires more involved computations beyond standard output of SEM software. The test statistic T$\sim$d has been widely used in practice, but in some applications it is negative due to negativity of its associated scaling correction. Using the implicit function theorem, this note develops an improved scaling correction leading to a new scaled difference statistic T̄(d) that avoids negative chi-square values.},

abstract = {Study of the conformational and electronic aspects of molecules may throw some light on the conformational preference for binding with the receptor and also their pharmacological importance. The transmitter substances, their agonists and antagonists are flexible molecules which appear to interact with quite distinct receptors. The electronic properties of GABA ([gamma]-aminobutyric acid) and several GABA-inhibitors have been investigated by calculating molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP) with a localized bond orbital technique. The GABA-inhibitors include several GABA-uptake inhibitors (e.g., [beta]-amino-isobutyric acid, guvacine and homo-[beta]-proline) and GABA-agonists (e.g., isoguvacine, isonipecotic acid and muscimol). The zwitterionic forms of these molecules have been investigated using their low energy conformers. The isopotential contour maps for various low energy conformers of GABA have been compared with the MEP contours of GABA inhibitors to find the biologically active species of these molecules. The MEP calculations on different forms of GABA show that there is a high positive potential zone around the nitrogen head and a deep negative potential zone around the carboxyl head. Superimposition of the simplified and partial MEP of GABA and GABA inhibitors leads to the pharmacophoric model of GABA-receptor and uptake carrier ligands.},

abstract = {This article seeks to demonstrate that, to function as a truly emancipatory phenomenon, disability culture must be relieved of the paradox that keeps it trapped in modernist assumptions that serve to reinforce its marginalised status. The paradox of disability culture may be stated as follows. How can we claim unity without falling into the same exclusionary practices that have served to create our divisive identifications in the first place? Conversely, how can we relinquish the practices of identification that are based on binary oppositions without losing the ability to claim identities at all? I argue that, by extricating it from its origins in essentialist assumptions, disability culture can be reinvigo rated as a truly emancipatory device, which is capable of devising positive identities which, rather than celebrating the 'disabled identity', rely on its dissolution.

abstract = {In applications involving count data, it is common to encounter an excess number of zeros. In the study of outpatient service utilization, for example, the number of utilization days will take on integer values, with many subjects having no utilization (zero values). Mixed-distribution models, such as the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB), are often used to fit such data. A more general class of mixture models, called hurdle models, can be used to model zero-deflation as well as zero-inflation. Several authors have proposed frequentist approaches to fitting zero-inflated models for repeated measures. We describe a practical Bayesian approach which incorporates prior information, has optimal small-sample properties, and allows for tractable inference. The approach can be easily implemented using standard Bayesian software. A study of psychiatric outpatient service use illustrates the methods.},

@article{Platt2008,
abstract = {Normatively and intuitively, we conceive of political participation as an integral component of democratic policymaking. However, research on participation generally does not include policy considerations as part of individuals’ decisions to engage in activism. I offer an opportunity model of participation that begins to study how policy goals shape individual participation and how aggregate participation shapes policymaking. The central argument is that individuals’ policy goals allow them to recognize those moments when it is most efficient and/or effective to take action. Examining black participation from 1980 to 1994, I show that black Americans are more likely to participate when they face external threats, are embedded in social networks, and have greater access to policymakers. Most importantly, the recognition of these opportunities varies according to individuals’ resources. This research moves beyond the discussion of who participates to address the equally fundamental question: participation for what?},
annote = {
        What is the article about?
        
          

        is wanting to change policy a motivating factor for political participation.
          

          
In the literature review and/or conceptual framework, how do authors talk about the relationship between political participation/orientation and life course experiences, and/or the relationship between political participation/orientation and college experiences?
        
          

        the main focus is how wanting to change policy, and access to policy makers may impact political participation relating to black politics. 
          

          
What interesting thoughts or assertions did authors make in literature review or discussion that we can use in our paper? (e.g., “the need to promote political participation is essential for our democracy,” “those who do not participate politically are likely to have a highly undemocratic view of the world”) Basically think about things we can use for fodder.
        
          

        in our variable of wanting to change political structure, that may be a proxy to support or not support this hypothesis, also with wanting to be a community leader, these may have in them policy goals and reasons for participation.
          

          
What variables or concepts relate to political participation?
        
          

        see below on what data was collected, overall 4 groups, participation, petitions, party and rally.

        
          
What are the research questions of the study?
        
          

        are people more likely to be active if someone (Reagan) that perceived to be against african ameriacns are in office, having allies in congress helps raise participation, as the nation more conservative and less access for black americans it may decrease participation, those who are in network are more likely to participate, and greater black participation will lead to more actions from congress on black issues.
          

          
What data was used or collected?
        
          

        good paragraph from the article:
"The Roper Center asks about 12 activities.5 Of these 12 forms of participation,five relate to individual efforts to communicate one’s preferences—contacting a member of Congress, attending a public meeting, writing a letter to a periodical, writing an article for a periodical, and making a speech. Three activities are concerned with organizational affiliation and service—serving on a committee in a local organization, serving as an officer for a club or organization, and being a member of a ‘‘good government’’ organization. Lastly, there are three forms of participation that incorporate individual efforts into some broader collective action—attending a political rally, working for a political party, and signing a petition. Given the impracticality of analyzing how all of these activities are shaped by opportunities and in turn influence congressional attention, I focus on these last three acts that involve collective efforts to influence policy."
          

          
What methodologies were employed?
        
          

        two stage random effects logit models, on the four groups then OLS regression on 58 parameters on aggregate level vairables looking at age, house hold income, education and organizational activity. 
          

          
IF SEM, describe model they intend to estimate
        
          

        NA
          

          
What findings were relevant to understanding political participation?
        
          

        new participants are needed to change policy agenda (Cobb and Elder 1972; Schattschneider 1975; Cobb et al. 1976; Baumgartner and Jones 1993). so therefore people that want to change political structure or be a community leader may be wanting to change policy, this is tangential i know but still could be discussed in future directions.
          

          

          
What interesting things stated in the discussion can we use for our paper.  Make sure you cite everything.
        
          

        black individuals are more likely to participate in high unemployment, durign the Reagan administration, when they are apart of a social network and have greater access to policy makers. no relationship was found with congressional attention to black issues.

The concept of participation plays an important role in the classification and has become a central construct in health care, rehabilitation, and in occupational therapy. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical analysis of the concept of participation in the ICF. As background, the origins and current presentation of the ICF are presented. The use and function of the ICF and the contemporary discussions regarding the classification are reviewed. An occupational perspective on participation in the ICF reveals major shortcomings regarding the subjective experience of meaning and autonomy. Furthermore, the ICF has limitations in capturing different kinds of participation in a single life situation. Following these analyses we discuss the advantages and shortcomings of using the ICF, and how an occupational perspective can contribute to an ongoing discussion about the development of the ICF.},

Content and concurrent validity of the Inventory were assessed by comparing the scores of clients grounded by medical diagnosis and by relating scores to counselors' judgments of severity of disability and employability. Clients with various primary disabilities appeared to differ from one another on the factor scales and on individual items in predictable ways. Total Functional Limitations scores were highly correlated with counselors' ratings of severity of disability and employability.},

@article{Carrasco2005,
abstract = {In any field in which decisions are subject to measurements, interchangeability between the methods used to obtain these measurements is essential. To consider methods as interchangeable, a certain degree of agreement is needed between the measurements they provide. The concordance correlation coefficient is an index that assesses the strength of agreement and it has been widely applied in situations in which measurements are made on a continuous scale. Recently the concordance correlation coefficient has been defined as a specific intraclass correlation coefficient estimated by the variance components of a Normal-Normal mixed linear model. Although this coefficient was defined for the continuous scale case, it may also be used with a discrete scale. In this case the data are often transformed and normalized, and the concordance correlation is applied. This study discusses the expression of the concordance correlation coefficient for discrete Poisson data by means of the Poisson-Normal generalized linear mixed model. The behaviour of the concordance correlation coefficient estimate is assessed by means of a simulation study, in which the estimates were compared using four models: three Normal-Normal mixed models with raw data, log-transformed data and square-root transformed data, and the Poisson-Normal generalized linear mixed model. An example is provided in which two different methods are used to measure CD34+ cells.},

When p=1 then b≡r and enhancement cannot occur. When p=2, for all full-rank R xx≠I, R xx=E[xx′]=V $\Lambda$ V′ (where V $\Lambda$ V′ denotes the eigen decomposition of R xx; $\lambda$ 1&gt;$\lambda$ 2), the set contains four vectors; the set ; contains an infinite number of vectors. When p≥3 (and $\lambda$ 1&gt;$\lambda$ 2&gt;⋯&gt;$\lambda$ p ), both sets contain an uncountably infinite number of vectors. Geometrical arguments demonstrate that B 1 occurs at the intersection of two hyper-ellipsoids in ℝ p . Equations are provided for populating the sets B 1 and B 2 and for demonstrating that maximum enhancement occurs when b is collinear with the eigenvector that is associated with $\lambda$ p (the smallest eigenvalue of the predictor correlation matrix). These equations are used to illustrate the logic and the underlying geometry of enhancement in population, multiple-regression models. R code for simulating population regression models that exhibit enhancement of any degree and any number of predictors is included in Appendices A and B.},

abstract = {Count data with excess zeros relative to a Poisson distribution are common in many biomedical applications. A popular approach to the analysis of such data is to use a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model. Often, because of the hierarchical study design or the data collection procedure, zero-inflation and lack of independence may occur simultaneously, which render the standard ZIP model inadequate. To account for the preponderance of zero counts and the inherent correlation of observations, a class of multi-level ZIP regression model with random effects is presented. Model fitting is facilitated using an expectation-maximization algorithm, whereas variance components are estimated via residual maximum likelihood estimating equations. A score test for zero-inflation is also presented. The multi-level ZIP model is then generalized to cope with a more complex correlation structure. Application to the analysis of correlated count data from a longitudinal infant feeding study illustrates the usefulness of the approach.},

annote = {·         What is the article about? Activists in the 1960s fell into three groups, Radical Activists, Institutional Activists, and Noninvolved, and their experiences as activists in college did impact their later political participation. The authors did state that though given low political participation in general society, their small numbers may be offset by their level of participation. This shows historical relevance, that college predictors go back to the civil rights era of the 1960s, but without the radical movements going on, I wonder how strong the results are compared to back then. 
·         In the literature review and/or conceptual framework, how do authors talk about the relationship between political participation/orientation and life course experiences, and/or the relationship between political participation/orientation and college experiences?        five dimensions of politicla participation, protest, community activism, party and campaign work, political communication and voting and patriotism (patriotism being defined as having a feeling for love of my country and show my patritosm by flying the flag or other way), the first three being more active forms of participation while the latter two are more passive.
·         What interesting thoughts or assertions did authors make in literature review or discussion that we can use in our paper? (e.g., “the need to promote political participation is essential for our democracy,” “those who do not participate politically are likely to have a highly undemocratic view of the world”) Basically think about things we can use for fodder. not all political activities may be active (like voting, or patriotism), and these may be in the calculus of how mcuh people participate. if a person is busy with life (like in 1997 variables) they still might be able to be "patriotic" since they require minimal resources.
·         What variables or concepts relate to political participation?        a survey was used to discuss political participation (see Table 1 of article for all questions), and these are divided in the groups.
·         What are the research questions of the study?        were there groups of students based on their level of activism in college many years after graduation.
·         What data was used or collected?        survey data, N=85 of returned surveys.
·         What methodologies were employed? EFA to determine how many factors there were, three were extracted with an eigenvalue >= 1, and then ANOVA on the factors relating to the political participation.
·         IF SEM, describe model they intend to estimate NA
·         What findings were relevant to understanding political participation?        different kind of activism can lead to different types of political participation 
·         What interesting things stated in the discussion can we use for our paper. Make sure you cite everything.        activists from the 1960s still tend to be active politically and so their experiences in college play a prominent role in their political participation after college 25 years after (Jennings 1987; Marwell et al. 1987; Whalen and Flacks 1980).
·         List citations of other studies that authors reference of regarding the relationship between political participation/orientation and/or the relationship between life course experiences, and/or political participation and college experiences?

@article{Burgess2010,
abstract = {Partial sleep deprivation is increasingly common in modern society. This study examined for the first time if partial sleep deprivation alters circadian phase shifts to bright light in humans. Thirteen young healthy subjects participated in a repeated-measures counterbalanced design with 2 conditions. Each condition had baseline sleep, a dim-light circadian phase assessment, a 3-day phase-advancing protocol with morning bright light, then another phase assessment. In one condition (no sleep deprivation), subjects had an 8-h sleep opportunity per night during the advancing protocol. In the other condition (partial sleep deprivation), subjects were kept awake for 4 h in near darkness (<0.25 lux), immediately followed by a 4-h sleep opportunity per night during the advancing protocol. The morning bright light stimulus was four 30-min pulses of bright light ($\sim$5000 lux), separated by 30-min intervals of room light. The light always began at the same circadian phase, 8 h after the baseline dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO). The average phase advance without sleep deprivation was 1.8 ± 0.6 (SD) h, which reduced to 1.4 ± 0.6 h with partial sleep deprivation (p < 0.05). Ten of the 13 subjects showed reductions in phase advances with partial sleep deprivation, ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 h. These results indicate that short-term partial sleep deprivation can moderately reduce circadian phase shifts to bright light in humans. This may have significant implications for the sleep-deprived general population and for the bright light treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder.},

@article{Baer,
abstract = {The 'Hard Problem' of consciousness and its 'Explanatory Gap' can only be explained if we develop a physical theory which recognizes the Universe as a cognitive being and is based upon a fundamental process that transforms mind into body and back again. The physical requirements needed to realize such a transformation cycle are investigated and an explicit implementation of the consciousness process is presented. This implementation consists of an integrated mind-body activity that explains mental experiences with a model of the activity itself. Such a self-referential loop is shown to be both a fundamental physical process and a container of primitive self- awareness from which complex experiences can be built. Explaining consciousness requires an expansion of current physical theories. To develop this expansion I will first associate the components of the consciousness process with individual operations occurring in the architecture of quantum theory. This will provide explicit mathematical equations required to describe conscious phenomena and show their limits. Because quantum equations apply to the content of space, but not to the sensation of space itself, they can only represent an approximate description of the consciousness process and are hence incomplete. I will, therefore, go on to discuss the approximations which limit quantum theory from providing a complete explanation of consciousness and suggest the metaphysical underpinnings required to expand quantum physics into a more complete description of reality. Lastly, I will discuss the implications of a reality model in which all parts of the universe, including the reader, are fundamentally self- measurement processes and the sensation of space is not that of an a priori container, but rather a 'what it feels like' to be a time-stable event.},

This study focuses on the practical implications of applying logistic regression, probit analysis, and linear regression to the problem of predicting college student retention. Rather than simply assuming that one technique is analytically superior to others based on theoretical grounds, this study explores how these techniques compare in predicting student retention using data provided by registrars from a national sample of colleges and universities. Results indicate that despite the theoretical advantages offered by logistic regression and probit analysis, there is little practical difference between either of these two techniques and more traditional linear regression.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop and assess a prejudice-reduction intervention for young children based on a relatively recent psychological concept, extended contact. A number of extended contact interventions were tested based on different models of generalized intergroup contact. A 3 (type of extended contact: neutral, decategorization, and “intergroup”) × 2 (time of interview: pre- vs. post-extended contacts) mixed design was used, with the latter variable being within participants. Non-disabled children ( N= 67) aged 5–10 years took part in a 6-week intervention involving reading stories featuring disabled and non-disabled children in friendship contexts. The main dependent variables were children's attitudes and intended behavior toward non-disabled and disabled people. Results showed that extended contact led to increased positivity toward the disabled, and this was most pronounced in the intergroup-extended contact condition. These findings suggest that extended contact can provide a prejudice-reduction intervention tool that can be used with young children in contexts in which the opportunity for direct contact is low. The findings also add to the psychological literature, providing support of the Hewstone and Brown (1986) “intergroup” model in the context of extended contact. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

·         What interesting thoughts or assertions did authors make in literature review or discussion that we can use in our paper? (e.g., “the need to promote political participation is essential for our democracy,” “those who do not participate politically are likely to have a highly undemocratic view of the world”) Think about things we can use for fodder.        discussions among individuals who are politically active may make them more knowledgeable about political issues and allow them to be more politically active. they also can pick up cues from others on their political predispositions (zaller 1992). 
·         What variables or concepts relate to political participation?        political talk, political agreement, and political knowledge. also controlled for was respondant knowledge, interest, strength of partisanship and political contact, and volume of political talk, % agreeing with discussants and political knolwedge. 
·         What are the research questions of the study?        does political talk affect participation.
·         What data was used or collected?        survey administered during 1996 political participation on two midwestern communities.
·         What methodologies were employed?        negative binomial regression and linear regression, ordinered regression

·         What interesting things stated in the discussion can we use for our paper. Make sure you cite everything.        that the people around you can influence your political participation and it can be also who you choose to hang out with as possible predictive of political participation.
·         List citations of other studies that authors reference of regarding the relationship between political participation/orientation and/or the relationship between life course experiences, and/or political participation and college experiences?

This study was part of a larger mixed-method investigation that explored comprehensive aspects of adaptation in adolescents with spina bifida (SB). The purpose of this qualitative component of the study was to explore the experiences of peer relationships in 31 adolescent women with SB. The participants were interviewed, and analysis was conducted for common themes. The five major themes and one subtheme were peers without disabilities (subtheme: peers with disabilities), normalization, challenges in peer connectedness, peer connectedness with adults, and romantic connectedness. Whereas some participants voiced close connections with peers, others described prejudices, stereotyping, and limited dating experiences. Results from this study support the need for comprehensive assessment of social relationships in adolescent women with SB and active interventions to address problems identified. Rehabilitation nurses are in a key position to implement social interventions in adolescents and young women with SB.},

abstract = {This article discusses the relation between empirical and normative approaches in bioethics. The issue of dwarf tossing, while admittedly unusual, is chosen as a point of departure because it challenges the reader to look with fresh eyes upon several central bioethical themes, including human dignity, autonomy, and the protection of vulnerable people. After an overview of current approaches to the integration of empirical and normative ethics, we consider five ways that the empirical and normative can be brought together to speak to the problem of dwarf tossing: prescriptive applied ethics, theoretical ethics, critical applied ethics, particularist ethics and integrated empirical ethics. We defend a position of critical applied ethics that allows for a two-way relation between empirical and normative theories. Against efforts fully to integrate the normative and the empirical into one synthesis, we propose that the two should stand in tension and relation to one another. The approach we endorse acknowledges that a social practice can and should be judged both by the gathering of empirical data and by normative ethics. Critical applied ethics uses a five stage process that includes: (a) determination of the problem, (b) description of the problem, (c) empirical study of effects and alternatives, (d) normative weighing and (e) evaluation of the effects of a decision. In each stage, we explore the perspective from both the empirical (sociological) and the normative ethical point of view. We conclude by applying our five-stage critical applied ethics to the example of dwarf tossing.},

Although achievement levels for both groups were comparable, students with LD scored significantly lower than students without LD in word reading, processing speed, semanticprocessing, and short-term memory. Differences were also found between groups in self-regulation and number of hours of studying Results showed that students with LD compensated for their processing deficits by relying on verbal abilities, learning strategies, and help seeking.},

There are lower expectations and high anxiety among students with LD. There was a relationship between LD and help seeking behavior. Those with low help seeking behavior had low GPA in the LD group while it did not have any effect in the non LD group. This shows that students with LD can do well in a post-secondary environmenet but they need to be able to be taught strong self-advocacy skills and know what skills to work on to be successful.},

In particular, value-added models (VAM) that use longitudinal student achievement data linked to teachers and schools to make inferences about teacher and school effectiveness have burgeoned. Depending on the available data and desired inferences, the models can range from straightforward hierarchical linear models to more complicated and computationally demanding cross-classified models. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how R, via the lme function for linear mixed effects models in the nlme package (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000), can be used to estimate all of the most common valueadded models used in educational research. After providing background on the substantive problem, we develop notation for the data and model structures that are considered. We then present a sequence of increasingly complex models and demonstrate how to estimate the models in R. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the R facilities for modeling longitudinal student achievement data.},

abstract = {Statisticians most often use the linear mixed model to analyze Gaussian longitudinal data. The value and familiarity of the R(2) statistic in the linear univariate model naturally creates great interest in extending it to the linear mixed model. We define and describe how to compute a model R(2) statistic for the linear mixed model by using only a single model. The proposed R(2) statistic measures multivariate association between the repeated outcomes and the fixed effects in the linear mixed model. The R(2) statistic arises as a 1-1 function of an appropriate F statistic for testing all fixed effects (except typically the intercept) in a full model. The statistic compares the full model with a null model with all fixed effects deleted (except typically the intercept) while retaining exactly the same covariance structure. Furthermore, the R(2) statistic leads immediately to a natural definition of a partial R(2) statistic. A mixed model in which ethnicity gives a very small p-value as a longitudinal predictor of blood pressure (BP) compellingly illustrates the value of the statistic. In sharp contrast to the extreme p-value, a very small R(2) , a measure of statistical and scientific importance, indicates that ethnicity has an almost negligible association with the repeated BP outcomes for the study.},

Treatment consisted of 9 twice-weekly, individual sessions. Independent evaluations were conducted at pretreatment; posttreatment; and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. All 3 active treatments reduced severity of PTSD and depression compared with WL but did not differ significantly from each other, and these gains were maintained throughout the follow-up period. However, in the intent-to-treat sample, PE was superior to SIT and PE-SIT on posttreatment anxiety and global social adjustment at follow-up and had larger effect sizes on PTSD severity, depression, and anxiety. SIT and PE-SIT did not differ significantly from each other on any outcome measure.},

abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) continue to grow in popularity due to their ability to directly acknowledge multiple levels of dependency and model different data types. For small sample sizes especially, likelihood-based inference can be unreliable with variance components being particularly difficult to estimate. A Bayesian approach is appealing but has been hampered by the lack of a fast implementation, and the difficulty in specifying prior distributions with variance components again being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly review previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples, carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated spline model for which we examine our prior specification in terms of the implied degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference is now practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies may be less accurate for such data.},

Chicago: University of Chicago Press) theory of student departure. The fact that there is limited empirical support for Tinto’s theory (Braxton, Sullivan, & Johnson, 1997, Handbook of Theory and Research, 12, 107–164) suggests the need to expand the theoretical grounding of the field, and use a broader set of theories or conceptual frameworks. The main objective of this study is to provide a thorough review of the different theories and conceptual frameworks that have been developed and/or applied in education, economics, sociology, and psychology to study the process of college persistence and attainment. The chapter contributes to the literature by providing an in-depth description of the theories that have been developed in other social sciences in the last four decades. This review would hopefully encourage scholars and graduate students in the field to expand the theoretical grounding and as a result address a broader set of research questions that need to be explored to gain a better understanding of the complexities of the process of college persistence and attainment.},

Both groups received melatonin and placebo treatment for 4 weeks with a 1-week washout period in between. Participants underwent a clinical interview and psychometric evaluation to assess depression, and overnight polysomnographic sleep studies were carried out at baseline and at the end of melatonin and placebo treatments. Furthermore, melatonin secretion rhythm as a circadian phase marker was assessed by measuring urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin levels. Results Melatonin treatment significantly reduced depression scores in the depressed patients as measured by the CES-D and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale – 17. Melatonin treatment improved sleep continuity in both groups compared to placebo and baseline conditions. Group I individuals showed marked alterations in melatonin rhythms compared to Group II individuals. Conclusion Exogenous melatonin treatment may be an effective treatment modality for individuals with circadian rhythm sleep disorders and associated comorbid depressive symptomatology.},

In a between-subjects experimental design with more than 600 participants, we evaluated the roles of disability type (AIDS, cerebral palsy, and stroke), stigma, and employee characteristics in acceptance of a coworker with a disability. Stigma largely mediated the relationship between disability type and acceptance. Employee characteristics had direct effects on some aspects of acceptance. Exploratory factor analysis of stigma revealed six factors; however, only a "performance impact" factor was consistently related to acceptance, suggesting that perceived implications of the coworker's disability for job performance are critical.},

Patterson and Thompson (1971) proposed a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach which takes into account the loss in degrees of freedom resulting from estimating fixed effects. Miller (1973) developed a satisfactory asymptotic theory for ML estimators of variance components. There are many iterative algorithms that can be considered for computing the ML or REML estimates. The computations on each iteration of these algorithms are those associated with computing estimates of fixed and random effects for given values of the variance components.},

abstract = {Recent public policy has sought to broaden the role of Medicaid, which typically serves people with limited income, to include increasing employment among people with disabilities and supporting people with disabilities who are working. In late 2001, we surveyed Medicaid agencies regarding their provision of services to working people with disabilities and collaboration with disability- and employment-related agencies and services. One third to one half of respondents were involved in Workforce Investment Act implementation at the state level and/or were implementing a Medicaid Buy-In option for working adults with disabilities. Collaboration with disability- or employment-focused agencies occurred at similarly moderate rates, with activities such as trainings and working groups being the most common types of collaboration reported. These findings suggest that while policy efforts to expand Medicaid's role in supporting employment of people with disabilities have been somewhat successful, there is potential for considerably more engagement of Medicaid agencies in this important issue.},

abstract = {Construct validity theory holds that (a) validity is a property of test score inter- pretations in terms of constructs that (b) reflects the strength of the evidence for these interpretations. In this paper, we argue that this view has absurd consequences. For instance, following construct validity theory, test score in- terpretations that deny that anything is measured by a test may themselves have a high degree of construct validity. In addition, construct validity theory implies that now defunct test score interpretations, like those attached to phlogiston measures in the 17th century, were valid at the time but became invalid when the theory of phlogiston was refuted. We propose an alternative view that holds that (a) validity is a property of measurement instruments that (b) codes whether these instruments are sensitive to variation in a targeted attribute. This theory avoids the absurdities of construct validity theory, and is broadly consistent with the view, commonly held by working researchers and textbook writers but not construct validity theorists, that a test is valid if it measures what it should measure. Finally, we discuss some pressing problems in psychological measurement that are salient within our conceptualization, and argue that the time has come to face them.},

Leaving college: rethinking the causes and cures of student attrition. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press student integration model and Bean and Metzner's Rev. Educ. Res. 55 (1985) 485 student attrition model have been influential in explaining persistence and attrition in higher education programs. However, these models were developed with on-campus programs in mind and, although they are broadly relevant to distance education programs, their ability to explain the persistence of online students is limited. Distance education students have characteristics and needs that differ from traditional learners and the virtual learning environment differs in important ways from an on-campus environment. This article draws chiefly from Tinto's and Bean and Metzner's models and the results of research into the needs of online distance education students in order to synthesize a composite model to better explain persistence and attrition among the largely nontraditional students that enroll in online courses.},

abstract = {Tinto postulates that students enter college with expectations. If these expectations are unmet, there is early disenchantment with the social and academic communities. Such disenchantments hinder academic and social integration which, in turn, influence subsequent institutional and goal commitments and ultimately student departure. These formulations are tested in a multi-institutional study of 263 first-time freshmen who entered four-year colleges and universities. The findings indicate that both academic and social integration are positively influenced by the meeting of expectations for academic and career development. Social integration is positively influenced by expectations for opportunities for personal involvement, but negatively affected by expectations for a collegiate atmosphere. Indirect effects on intentions to remain in the focal college are indirectly influenced by collegiate atmosphere and academic and career development. Implications for enrollment management and the development of linkages between theories of college choice and student departure are drawn.},

@article{Primorac2001,
abstract = {Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), or brittle bone disease, is a heritable disorder characterized by increased bone fragility. Four different types of the disease are commonly distinguished, ranging from a mild condition (type I) to a lethal one (type II). Types III and IV are the severe forms surviving the neonatal period. In most cases, there is a reduction in the production of normal type I collagen or the synthesis of abnormal collagen as a result of mutations in the type I collagen genes. These classic forms of OI are described in this review. There are instances, however, where alterations in bone matrix components, other than type I collagen, are the basic abnormalities of the OI. Recently, three such discrete types have been identified by histomorphometric evaluation (types V and VI) and linkage analysis (Rhizomelic OI). They provide evidence for the as yet poorly understood complexity of the phenotype-genotype correlation in OI. We also discuss bisphosphonates treatment as well as fracture management and surgical correction of deformities observed in the patients with OI. However, ultimately, strengthening bone in OI will involve steps to correct the underlying genetic mutations that are responsible for this disorder. Thus, we also describe different genetic therapeutic approaches that have been tested either on OI cells or on available OI murine models.},

abstract = {Research on science attitudes has focused mostly on teacher variables and learning environment variables. Furthermore, in the parent involvement literature, the outcome variable of interest has been mostly science achievement rather than science attitudes. Limited research is available on the joint influence of teacher and parent variables on science attitudes. This article proposes a model of parent and teacher influences on the science attitudes of eighth graders using data from the base year survey of the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling methodology for categorical data. The results show that the availability of science facilities has a significant direct effect on science experiments. Parental involvement has significant direct as well as indirect effects on science attitudes mediated through science activities and library/museum visits. Science activities have a significant direct effect on science attitudes. This study suggests that improving the quality of science instruction and science activities in schools will have implications for science education in schools and this will, in turn, indirectly affect the science attitudes of students. More importantly, the findings of this study provide concrete empirical evidence that parents play a very important role in the development of science attitudes of students},

This method has often been challenged, has occasionally been defended, and has persistently been used through most of the history of scientific psychology. This article reviews both the criticisms of NHST and the arguments brought to its defense. The review shows that the criticisms address the logical validity of inferences arising from NHST, whereas the defenses stress the pragmatic value of these inferences. The author suggests that both critics and apologists implicitly rely on Bayesian assumptions. When these assumptions are made explicit, the primary challenge for NHST—and any system of induction—can be confronted. The challenge is to find a solution to the question of replicability.},

In this report, we describe the statistical approaches that underlie these different procedures and discuss their strengths and weaknesses when applied to fit correlated binary responses. We then illustrate these considerations by applying these procedures implemented in some popular software packages to simulated and real study data. Our simulation results indicate a lack of reliability for most of the procedures considered, which carries significant implications for applying such popular software packages in practice.

abstract = {One out of every seven people in the United States has a disabling condition that interferes with their lives (Pope & Tarlov, 1991). A variety of research has shown that the more contact a person has with a disability, the more likely that person will have a more positive attitude toward others with disabilities. Another contributor to attitudes about others and interactions with them may relate to social abilities and concerns about how the peer group views you. The current study is exploring the link between the attitudes of people without disabilities towards people with disabilities, how much contact the person has with someone with a disability, and the amount of social anxiety the person has. Results show that the more contact a person has with a disability, the more positive their attitude will be. Results also indicate that the more social anxiety a person has, the less positive their attitude will be. A third significant analysis is that the more a person understands the issues related to those with disabilities, the more positive their attitude will be. The last significant result indicates that the more contact a person has with disabilities, the more he/she will understand the issues. Implications of this study include exposure to and normalizing disabilities, consistent or genuine contact with disabilities to increase positive attitudes, and general education about the various types of disabilities.},

abstract = {It is common to summarize statistical comparisons by declarations of statistical significance or nonsignificance. Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitraryfor example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1% significance level to 4.9%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities. The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problemsthat statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between "significant" and "not significant" is not itself statistically significant.},

It is based on the principle of data augmentation and a latent variable is introduced, similar to the approach of Albert and Chib (J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 88 (1993) 669), who applied it to the probit model. In general, the full conditional distributions are intractable, but with the introductions of the latent variable all conditional distributions are uniform, and the Gibbs sampler is easily applicable. Marginal likelihoods for model selection can be obtained at the expense of additional Gibbs cycles. The technique is extended and can be applied with nominal or ordinal polychotomous data.},

abstract = {This article attempts to explain why the social constructionist paradigm has failed to replace the medical model in American disability theory. The social movement led by American disability activists attempted to reframe the definition of disability using a minority group model based on the social constructionist paradigm. This paper argues that the disability movement was unable to successfully advance the social constructionist paradigm because the activists accepted the Americans With Disabilities Act (1990) despite its ideological basis in the medical model of disability, and the social constructionist theory does not adequately account for the importance of structural constraints to redefinition.

abstract = {Social Integration has been found by several scholars to have a significant impact on the subsequent institutional commitment and retention of college students. Few of these scholars, however, have attempted to examine whether social integration has a different impact on female students as compared to male students. This paper presents the results of a study which examined whether the impact of social integration on subsequent institutional commitment is conditional on gender. Findings suggest the need to slightly revise how higher education scholars and practitioners think about social integration and its impact of student retention.},

@article{Gaher2007,
abstract = {Two studies examined the associations between evaluations (good-bad) and expected likelihood (likely-unlikely) of alcohol- and marijuana-related problems and hazardous consumption and problems among college students. Participants provided data on alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and expectancies and evaluations of alcohol problems; marijuana use indices, marijuana-related problems, marijuana effect expectancies, and likelihood and evaluations of marijuana problems. Evaluations of alcohol problems were positively related to the number of binge drinking occasions and alcohol-related problems. The interaction between evaluations and expectancies was significant in predicting the number of binge drinking occasions. Expectancies demonstrated a curvilinear relationship with binge drinking and alcohol-related problems. Marijuana users evaluated marijuana-related problems as less negative and less likely to occur than did nonusers. Expectancies, but not evaluations, of negative consequences were significantly associated with marijuana use intensity. Expectancies of problems demonstrated a curvilinear relationship with marijuana-use intensity and marijuana problems. Men evaluated alcohol and marijuana problems less negatively than did women. In summary, the expected likelihood of alcohol-marijuana problems and the evaluation of such problems represent a vulnerability factor associated with increased liability for hazardous alcohol and marijuana use.},
