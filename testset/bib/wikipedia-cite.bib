@article{Chib1995,
abstract = {We provide a detailed, introductory exposition of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a powerful Markov chain method to simulate multivariate distributions. A simple, intuitive derivation of this method is given along with guidance on implementation. Also discussed are two applications of the algorithm, one for implementing acceptance-rejection sampling when a blanketing function is not available and the other for implementing the algorithm with block-at-a-time scans. In the latter situation, many different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {There have recently been significant theoretical developments in multilevel statistical modeling, and improved software is readily available. This study demonstrates the application of multilevel modeling to one of the most common issues that confront institutional researchers: that of student attrition, where the response variable is typically binary rather than continuous. Comparisons are made with a traditional logistic regression approach. The data pertain to one large university. The techniques illustrated may be extended to the analysis of data sets encompassing many institutions, making meaningful interinstitutional comparisons of performance feasible even when there is hierarchical clustering present in the data.},
