The proof does not need observables localized in space-time regions of arbitrarily small volume, but uses relativistic invariance in an essential way. I t is given for the case of spinless neutral particles, but is easily extendable to all cases of charge and spin.

If T maps light cones onto light cones and dim M >= 3, it is shown that T is, up to a scale factor, an inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation.

	abstract = {Holonomy algebras arise naturally in the classical description of Yang-Mills fields and gravity, and it has been suggested, at a heuristic level, that they may also play an important role in a non-perturbative treatment of the quantum theory. The aim of this paper is to provide a mathematical basis for this proposal. The quantum holonomy algebra is constructed, and, in the case of real connections, given the structure of a certain C-star algebra. A proper representation theory is then provided using the Gel'fand spectral theory. A corollory of these general results is a precise formulation of the ``loop transform'' proposed by Rovelli and Smolin. Several explicit representations of the holonomy algebra are constructed. The general theory developed here implies that the domain space of quantum states can always be taken to be the space of maximal ideals of the C-star algebra. The structure of this space is investigated and it is shown how observables labelled by ``strips'' arise naturally.},

A similar geometric description is valid for the algebras associated with double cones. Moreover essential duality holds on the Minkowski space $M$, and Haag duality for double cones holds provided the net of local algebras is extended to a pre-cosheaf on the superworld $\tilde M$, i.e. the universal covering of the Dirac-Weyl compactification of $M$. As a consequence a PCT symmetry exists for any algebraic conformal field theory in even space-time dimension. Analogous results hold for a Poincare covariant theory provided the modular groups corresponding to wedge algebras have the expected geometrical meaning and the split property is satisfied. In particular the Poincare representation is unique in this case.},

The quantum nature of the underlying spacetime replaces a local interaction by a specific nonlocal effective interaction in the ordinary Minkowski space. A detailed study of interacting QFT and of the smoothing of ultraviolet divergences is deferred to a subsequent paper. In the classical limit where the Planck length goes to zero, our Quantum Spacetime reduces to the ordinary Minkowski space times a two component space whose components are homeomorphic to the tangent bundle TS^2 of the 2-sphere.

The well-known on-shell crossing symmetry of the S-Matrix and of formfactors (cyclicity relation) in such theories is intimately related to the KMS properties of new quantum-local PFG (one-particle polarization-free generators) of these wedge algebras. These generators are ``on-shell'' and their Fourier transforms turn out to fulfill the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. As the wedge algebras contain the crossing symmetry informations, the double cone algebras reveal the particle content of fields. Modular theory associates with this double cone algebra two very useful chiral conformal quantum field theories which are the algebraic versions of the light ray algebras.},

In the context of real, linear scalar field theory on an arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetime, we establish a worldline quantum inequality on the normal ordered energy density, valid for arbitrary smooth timelike trajectories of the observer, arbitrary smooth compactly supported weight functions and arbitrary Hadamard quantum states. Normal ordering is performed relative to an arbitrary choice of Hadamard reference state. The inequality obtained generalises a previous result derived for static trajectories in a static spacetime. The underlying argument is straightforward and is made rigorous using the techniques of microlocal analysis. In particular, an important role is played by the characterisation of Hadamard states in terms of the microlocal spectral condition. We also give a compact form of our result for stationary trajectories in a stationary spacetime.},

In this case, the field net and the gauge group can be constructed as in Minkowski spacetime. The second part of this paper derives spin-statistics theorems on spacetimes with appropriate symmetries. Two situations are considered: First, if the spacetime has a bifurcate Killing horizon, as is the case in the presence of black holes, then restricting the observables to the Killing horizon together with modular covariance for the Killing flow yields a conformally covariant quantum field theory on the circle and a conformal spin-statistics theorem for charged sectors localizable on the Killing horizon. Secondly, if the spacetime has a rotation and PT symmetry like the Schwarzschild-Kruskal black holes, geometric modular action of the rotational symmetry leads to a spin-statistics theorem for charged covariant sectors where the spin is defined via the SU(2)-covering of the spatial rotation group SO(3).},

Because of the abstract nature of the underlying concepts, this theory became (except for some sporadic results) a technique for quantum eld theory only in the beginning of the nineties. In this review the results obtained up to this point will be collected and some problems for the future will be discussed at the end. In the rst section the technical tools will be presented. Then in the second section two concepts, the half-sided translations and the half-sided modular inclusions, will be explained. These concepts have revolutionized the handling of quantum eld theory. Examples for which the modular groups are explicitly known are presented in the third section. One of the important results of the new theory is the proof of the PCT-theorem in the theory of local observables. Questions connected with the proof are discussed in section four. Section ve deals with the structure of local algebras and with questions connected with symmetry groups. In section six a theory of tensor product decompositions will be presented. In the last section problems closely connected with the modular theory and should be treated in the future will be discussed.},

Although we do not restrict ourselves to the immersive smooth or analytical case, any finite set of paths depends on a finite set of independent paths, a so-called hyph. This generalizes the well-known directedness of the set of smooth webs and that of analytical graphs, respectively. Due to these propositions, on the one hand, the projections from $\Ab$ to the lattice gauge theory are surjective and open.

In this case, replacing the vacuum with a suitable ``infravacuum'' state can improve the localisability of the charges in such a way that the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) theory of superselection sectors is applicable. As an explicit example for this phenomenon, we consider a certain class of sectors of the free massless scalar field. These sectors carry a charge of electric type, and the corresponding infravacuum background may be interpreted as a cloud of infrared radiation. Motivated by this situation, we propose a model-independent definition of infravacuum representations and derive some of their properties. We analyse in particular their role as reference representations for DHR theory and investigate to what an extent the absence of a translation invariant vector affects the results of the DHR analysis. Special emphasis is put on the functorial aspects of the theory and on the description of the covariance and the spectral properties of charged sectors in terms of so-called charge transporting cocycles.},

Here we propose a new concept which does not suffer from this limitation. It is based on a procedure which cannot be directly formulated in terms of pointlike fields but requires ``holographic'' manipulations of the algebras generated by those fields. We illustrate the new concepts in the setting of factorizable d=1+1 models and show that the known fact of absence of ultraviolet problems in those models (in the presence of higher than canonical dimensions) also passes to their holographic images. In higher spacetime dimensions d>=1+1 the holographic image lacks the transversal localizability; however this can be remedied by doing holography on d-2 additional lightfronts which share one lightray (Scanning by d-1 chiral conformal theories).},

The term modern\" in the title refers to the fact that the quantum theory is based on formulating classical general relativity as a theory of connections rather than metrics as compared to in original version due to Arnowitt, Deser and Misner. Canonical quantum general relativity is an attempt to define a mathematically rigorous, non-perturbative, background independent theory of Lorentzian quantum gravity in four spacetime dimensions in the continuum. The approach is minimal in that one simply analyzes the logical consequences of combining the principles of general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics. The requirement to preserve background independence has lead to new, fascinating mathematical structures which one does not see in perturbative approaches, e.g. a fundamental discreteness of spacetime seems to be a prediction of the theory providing a first substantial evidence for a theory in which the gravitational field acts as a natural UV cut-off. An effort has been made to provide a self-contained exposition of a restricted amount of material at the appropriate level of rigour which at the same time is accessible to graduate students with only basic knowledge of general relativity and quantum field theory on Minkowski space.},

For a quantum system on the space-time modeled by a net of local algebras, the associated dynamics is expressed via a suitable family of ``propagators''. In the best of situations, this dynamics is covariant, but more typically the dynamics will be ``quasi-covariant'' in a sense we make precise. We then show by using our technique of ``transplanting'' states and nets of local algebras from de Sitter space to Robertson-Walker space that there exist quantum systems on Robertson-Walker spaces with quasi-covariant dynamics.

Here we study another more recent aspect. We explain in this paper modular concepts by which we are able to construct the local operator algebras for all standard positive energy representations directly i.e. without going through field coordinatizations. In this way the artificial emphasis on Lagrangian field coordinates is avoided from the very beginning. These new concepts allow to treat also those cases of ``exceptional'' Wigner representations associated with anyons and the famous Wigner ``spin tower''which have remained inaccessible to Lagrangian quantization. Together with the d=1+1 factorizing models (whose modular construction has been studied previously), they form an interesting family of theories with a rich vacuum-polarization structure (but no on shell real particle creation) to which the modular methods can be applied for their explicit construction. We explain and illustrate the algebraic strategy of this construction. We also comment on possibilities of formulating the Wigner theory in a setting of a noncommutative spacetime substrate. This is potentially interesting in connection with recent unitarity- and Lorentz invariance- preserving results of the special nonlocality caused by this kind of noncommutativity.},

The content of the present note is the observation that under some mild assumptions, the mathematical structure of representations of A can be analyzed rather effortlessly, to a certain extent: Each representation can be labeled by sets of functions and measures on the space of (generalized) connections that fulfill certain conditions. These considerations are however mostly of mathematical nature. Their physical content remains to be clarified, and physically interesting examples are yet to be constructed.},

The features that distinguish it from other quantum gravity theories are 1) background independence and 2) minimality of structures. Background independence means that this is a non-perturbative approach in which one does not perturb around a given, distinguished, classical background metric, rather arbitrary fluctuations are allowed, thus precisely encoding the quantum version of Einstein's radical perception that gravity is geometry. Minimality here means that one explores the logical consequences of bringing together the two fundamental principles of modern physics, namely general covariance and quantum theory, without adding any experimentally unverified additional structures. The approach is purposely conservative in order to systematically derive which basic principles of physics have to be given up and must be replaced by more fundamental ones. QGR unifies all presently known interactions in a new sense by quantum mechanically implementing their common symmetry group, the four-dimensional diffeomorphism group, which is almost completely broken in perturbative approaches.

In analogy with Weyl theorem on the asymptotic density distribution of the Laplacian eigenvalues, passing to a quantum system with infinitely many degrees of freedom, we regard these coefficients as noncommutative geometric invariants. Under a natural modularity assumption, the leading term of the entropy (noncommutative area) is proportional to the central charge c, the first order correction (noncommutative Euler characteristic) is proportional to log\mu\_A, where \mu\_A is the global index of A, and the second spectral invariant is again proportional to c. We give a further general method to define a mean entropy by considering conformal symmetries that preserve a discretization of S^1 and we get the same value proportional to c. We then make the corresponding analysis with the proper Hamiltonian associated to an interval. We find here, in complete generality, a proper mean entropy proportional to log\\mu\_A with a first order correction defined by means of the relative entropy associated with canonical states. By considering a class of black holes with an associated conformal quantum field theory on the horizon, and relying on arguments in the literature, we indicate a possible way to link the noncommutative area with the Bekenstein-Hawking classical area description of entropy.},

For quantum systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom the simplest possibility, i.e., factors of type I in the terminology of Murray and von Neumann, are perfectly adequate. In relativistic quantum field theory (RQFT), on the other hand, factors of type III occur naturally. The same holds true in quantum statistical mechanics of infinite systems. In this brief review some physical consequences of the type III property of the von Neumann algebras corresponding to localized observables in RQFT and their difference from the type I case will be discussed. The cumulative effort of many people over more than 30 years has established a remarkable uniqueness result: The local algebras in RQFT are generically isomorphic to the unique, hyperfinite type ${ III}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_{1}$ factor in Connes' classification of 1973.

We present rigorous QEI bounds for a class of interacting quantum fields, namely the unitary, positive energy conformal field theories (with stress-energy tensor) on two-dimensional Minkowski space. The QEI bound depends on the weight used to average the stress-energy tensor and the central charge(s) of the theory, but not on the quantum state. We give bounds for various situations: averaging along timelike, null and spacelike curves, as well as over a spacetime volume. In addition, we consider boundary conformal field theories and more general 'moving mirror' models. Our results hold for all theories obeying a minimal set of axioms which -- as we show -- are satisfied by all models built from unitary highest-weight representations of the Virasoro algebra. In particular, this includes all (unitary, positive energy) minimal models and rational conformal field theories. Our discussion of this issue collects together (and, in places, corrects) various results from the literature which do not appear to have been assembled in this form elsewhere.},

After a compact introduction to micro-local analysis and the theory of one-parameter groups of automorphisms, which are used exensively throughout the investigation, we are concerned with modular theory and its consequences in mathematics, e.g., Connes' cocycle theorem and classification of type III factors and Jones' index theory, as well as in physics, e.g., the determination of local von Neumann algebras to be hyperfinite factors of type III\_1, the formulation of thermodynamic equilibrium states for infinite-dimensional quantum systems (KMS states) and the discovery of modular action as geometric transformations. However, our main focus are its applications in physics, in particular the modular action as Lorentz boosts on the Rindler wedge, as dilations on the forward light cone and as conformal mappings on the double cone. Subsequently, their most important implications in local quantum physics are discussed. The purpose of this thesis is to shed more light on the transition from the known massless modular action to the wanted massive one in the case of double cones. First of all the infinitesimal generator of the massive modular group is investigated, especially some assumptions on its structure are verified explicitly for the first time for two concrete examples. Then, two strategies for the calculation of group itself are discussed. Some formalisms and results from operator theory and the method of second quantisation used in this thesis are made available in the appendix.},

	abstract = {Recent work indicates an approach to the formulation of diffeomorphism invariant quantum field theories (qft's) on the Groenewold-Moyal (GM) plane. In this approach to the qft's, statistics gets twisted and the S-matrix in the non-gauge qft's become independent of the noncommutativity parameter \theta^{\mu \nu}. Here we show that the noncommutative algebra has a commutative spacetime algebra as a substructure: the Poincar\'{e} and diffeomorphism groups are based on this algebra in the twisted approach. It is natural to preserve gauge symmetries as well by basing it on this algebra. Then gravity and gauge sectors are the same those for \theta^{\mu \nu}=0, but their interaction with matter fields is sensitive to \theta^{\mu \nu}. We calculate e^- + e^- -\&gt; e^- + e^- and \gamma + e^- \-\&gt; \gamma + e^- cross-sections in the tree approximation and explicitly display their dependence on \theta^{\mu \nu}. Remarkably the zero of the elastic e^- + e^-\ -\&gt; e^- + e^- cross-section at 90-degrees in the centre-of-mass system, which is due to Pauli principle, is shifted away as a function of \theta^{\mu \nu} and energy. This shows that noncommutativity modifies Pauli principle. We study this motion of zero in detail. An important final point of this paper is the following: the S-matrix involves time-ordered products of the interaction Hamiltonian densit\y H\_I, a\nd H\_I(x) \and H\_I(y) do not commute when x and y are space-like separated. As a result, the S-matrix is not Lorentz-invariant despite the preceding efforts to maintain it.},

Our choice of the quantum group representations naturally ensures self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian and the higher integrals of motion. These models are studied with the help of the separation of variables method. We show that the spectral problem for the integrals of motion can be reformulated as the problem to determine a subset among the solutions to certain finite difference equations (Baxter equation and quantum Wronskian equation) which is characterized by suitable analytic and asymptotic properties. A key technical tool is the so-called Q-operator, for which we give an explicit construction. Our results allow us to establish some connections to related results and conjectures on the sinh-Gordon theory in continuous space-time.

We define notions of locally covariant QEIs of both 'absolute' and 'difference' types and show that existing QEIs satisfy these conditions. Local covariance permits us to place constraints on the renormalised stress-energy tensor in one spacetime using QEIs derived in another, in subregions where the two spacetimes are isometric. This is of particular utility where one of the two spacetimes exhibits a high degree of symmetry and the QEIs are available in simple closed form. Various general applications are presented, including a priori constraints (depending only on geometric quantities) on the ground-state energy density in a static spacetime containing locally Minkowskian regions. In addition, we present a number of concrete calculations in both two and four dimensions which demonstrate the consistency of our bounds with various known ground- and thermal state energy densities. Examples considered include the Rindler and Misner spacetimes, and spacetimes with toroidal spatial sections. In this paper we confine the discussion to globally hyperbolic spacetimes; subsequent papers will also discuss spacetimes with boundary and other related issues.},

The main result of the paper concerns the representation theory of the kinematical algebra: We show that there is only one cyclic representation invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms. While this result is particularly important for loop quantum gravity, we are rather general: The precise definition of the abstract *-algebra of the basic kinematical observables we give could be used for any theory in which the configuration variable is a connection with a compact structure group. The variables are constructed from the holonomy map and from the fluxes of the momentum conjugate to the connection.

The input in this construction is not a classical Lagrangian, but rather a prescribed factorizing S-matrix, i.e. the inverse scattering problem for such quantum field theories is studied. For a large class of factorizing S-matrices, certain associated quantum fields, which are localized in wedge-shaped regions of Minkowski space, are constructed explicitely. With the help of these fields, the local observable content of the corresponding model is defined and analyzed by employing methods from the algebraic framework of quantum field theory. The abstract problem in this analysis amounts to the question under which conditions an algebra of wedge-localized observables can be used to generate a net of local observable algebras with the right physical properties. The answer given here uses the so-called modular nuclearity condition, which is shown to imply the existence of local observables and the Reeh-Schlieder property. In the analysis of the concrete models, this condition is proven for a large family of S-matrices, including the scattering operators of the Sinh-Gordon model and the scaling Ising model as special examples. The so constructed models are then investigated with respect to their scattering properties. They are shown to solve the inverse scattering problem for the considered S-matrices, and a proof of asymptotic completeness is given.},

We draw the two following conclusions for such theories. (1) The value of the central charge c is an invariant and hence the Virasoro nets for different values of c are not isomorphic as Moebius covariant nets. (2) A vacuum preserving internal symmetry always commutes with the diffeomorphism symmetries. We further use our result to give a large class of new examples of nets (even strongly additive ones), which are not diffeomorphism covariant; i.e. which do not admit an extension of the symmetry to Diff^+(S^1).},

Our method is based on the geometry of the complex de Sitter space-time and on the introduction of a class of holomorphic functions on this manifold, called perikernels, which reproduce mutatis mutandis the structural properties of the two-point correlation functions of the minkowskian quantum field theory. The theory contains as basic elementary case the linear massive field models in their ``preferred'' representation. The latter are described by the introduction of de Sitter plane waves in their tube domains which lead to a new integral representation of the two-point functions and to a Fourier-Laplace type transformation on the hyperboloid. The Hilbert space structure of these theories is then analysed by using this transformation. In particular we show the Reeh-Schlieder property. For general two-point functions, a substitute to the Wick rotation is defined both in complex space-time and in the complex mass variable, and substantial results concerning the derivation of Kallen-Lehmann type representation are obtained.},

The emergent model contains an infinite family of fields which are labelled by different noncommutativity parameters, and related to each other by Lorentz transformations. The relative localization properties of these fields are investigated, and it is shown that to each field one can assign a wedge-shaped localization region of Minkowski space. This assignment is consistent with the principles of covariance and locality, i.e. fields localized in spacelike separated wedges commute. Regarding the model as a non-local, but wedge-local, quantum field theory on ordinary (commutative) Minkowski spacetime, it is possible to determine two-particle S-matrix elements, which turn out to be non-trivial.

The physical space-time is taken to be a product of a continuous four-manifold by a discrete set of points. The treatment of Connes is modified in such a way that the basic algebra is defined over the space of matrices, and the breaking mechanism is planted in the Dirac operator. This mechanism is then applied to three examples. In the first example the discrete space consists of two points, and the two algebras are taken respectively to be those of $2\times 2$ and $1\times 1$ matrices. With the Dirac operator containing the vacuum breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)$ to $U(1)$, the model is shown to correspond to the standard model. In the second example the discrete space has three points, two of the algebras are identical and consist of $5\times 5$ complex matrices, and the third algebra consists of functions.

We show by construction that such a localization structure exists also in the case of massive anyons in d=2+1, i.e. for particles with positive mass and with arbitrary spin s in the reals. The construction is completely intrinsic to the corresponding ray representation of the (proper orthochronous) Poincare group. Our result is of particular interest since there are no free fields for anyons, which would fix a localization structure in a straightforward way. We present explicit formulas for the real subspaces, expected to turn out useful for the construction of a quantum field theory for anyons. In accord with well-known results, only localization in string-like, instead of point-like or bounded, regions is achieved.

@article{Hollands:2007,
	abstract = {We present a proof that quantum Yang-Mills theory can be consistently defined as a renormalized, perturbative quantum field theory on an arbitrary globally hyperbolic curved, Lorentzian spacetime. To this end, we construct the non-commutative algebra of observables, in the sense of formal power series, as well as a space of corresponding quantum states. The algebra contains all gauge invariant, renormalized, interacting quantum field operators (polynomials in the field strength and its derivatives), and all their relations such as commutation relations or operator product expansion. It can be viewed as a deformation quantization of the Poisson algebra of classical Yang-Mills theory equipped with the Peierls bracket. The algebra is constructed as the cohomology of an auxiliary algebra describing a gauge fixed theory with ghosts and anti-fields. A key technical difficulty is to establish a suitable hierarchy of Ward identities at the renormalized level that ensure conservation of the interacting BRST-current, and that the interacting BRST-charge is nilpotent. The algebra of physical interacting field observables is obtained as the cohomology of this charge. As a consequence of our constructions, we can prove that the operator product expansion closes on the space of gauge invariant operators. Similarly, the renormalization group flow is proved not to leave the space of gauge invariant operators.},

	abstract = {We present an algorithm for constructing the Wilson operator product expansion (OPE) for perturbative interacting quantum field theory in general Lorentzian curved spacetimes, to arbitrary orders in perturbation theory. The remainder in this expansion is shown to go to zero at short distances in the sense of expectation values in arbitrary Hadamard states. We also establish a number of general properties of the OPE coefficients: (a) they only depend (locally and covariantly) upon the spacetime metric and coupling constants, (b) they satisfy an associativity property, (c) they satisfy a renormalization group equation, (d) they satisfy a certain microlocal wave front set condition, (e) they possess a ``scaling expansion''. The latter means that each OPE coefficient can be written as a sum of terms, each of which is the product of a curvature polynomial at a spacetime point, times a Lorentz invariant Minkowski distribution in the tangent space of that point. The algorithm is illustrated in an example.},

	abstract = {The general properties of the factorized S-matrix in two-dimensional space-time are considered. The relation between the factorization property of the scattering theory and the infinite number of conservation laws of the underlying field theory is discussed. The factorization of the total S-matrix is shown to impose hard restrictions on two-particle matrix elements: they should satisfy special identities, the so-called factorization equations. The general solution of the unitarity, crossing and factorization equations is found for the S-matrices having isotopic O(N)-symmetry. The solution turns out to have different properties for the cases N = 2 and N greater-or-equal, slanted 3. For N = 2 the general solution depends on one parameter (of coupling constant type), whereas the solution for N greater-or-equal, slanted 3 has no parameters but depends analytically on N. The solution for N = 2 is shown to be an exact soliton S-matrix of the sine-Gordon model (equivalently the massive Thirring model). The total S-matrix of the model is constructed. In the case of N greater-or-equal, slanted 3 there are two ``minimum'' solutions, i.e., those having a minimum set of singularities. One of them is shown to be an exact S matrix of the quantum O(N)-symmetric nonlinear σ-model, the other is argued to describe the scattering of elementary particles of the Gross-Neveu model.},

In the present article, the status of these generators is analyzed in a general setting. It is shown that such operators exist in any theory and in any number of spacetime dimensions. But in more than two dimensions they have rather delicate domain properties in the presence of interaction. If, for example, they are defined and temperate on a translation-invariant, dense domain, then the underlying theory yields only trivial scattering. In two-dimensional theories, these domain properties are consistent with non-trivial interaction, but they exclude particle production. Thus the range of applications of polarization-free generators seems to be limited to the realm of two-dimensional theories.},

	abstract = {A new approach to the construction of interacting quantum field theories on two-dimensional Minkowski space is discussed. In this program, models are obtained from a prescribed factorizing S-matrix in two steps. At first, quantum fields which are localized in infinitely extended, wedge-shaped regions of Minkowski space are constructed explicitly. In the second step, local observ ables are analyzed with operator-algebraic techniques, in particular by using the modular nuclearity condition of Buchholz, d{\rq}Antoni and Longo. Besides a model-independent result regarding the Reeh-Schlieder property of the vacuum in this framework, an infinite class of quantum field theoretic models with non-trivial interaction is constructed. This construction completes a program initiated by Schroer in a large family of theories, a particular example being the Sinh-Gordon model. The crucial problem of establishing the existence of local observables in these models is solved by verifying the modular nuclearity condition, which here amounts to a condition on analytic properties of form factors of observables localized in wedge regions. It is shown that the constructed models solve the inverse scattering problem for the considered class of S-matrices. Moreover, a proof of asymptotic completeness is obtained by explicitly computing total sets of scattering states. Thestructure of these collision states is found to be in agreement with the heuristic formulae underlying the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra.},

This change of variables is checked by comparing the ordinary Dirac-Born-Infeld theory with its noncommutative counterpart.

Wiesbrock has shown that strongly additive nets of von Neumann algebras on the circle are in correspondence with standard half-sided modular inclusions. We show that a finite index endomorphism on a half-sided modular inclusion extends to a finite index endomorphism on the corresponding net of von Neumann algebras on the circle. Moreover, we present another approach to encoding endomorphisms on nets of Neumann algebras on the circle into half-sided modular inclusions. There is a natural way to associate a weight to a Moebius covariant endomorphism. The properties of this weight has been studied by Bertozzini, Conti and Longo. In this paper we show the converse, namely how to associate a Moebius covariant endomorphism to a given weight under certain assumptions, thus obtaining a correspondence between a class of weights on a half-sided modular inclusion and a subclass of the Moebius covariant endomorphisms on the associated net of von Neumann algebras. This allows us to treat Moebius covariant endomorphisms in terms of weights on half-sided modular inclusions. As our aim is to provide a framework for treating endomorphisms on nets of von Neumann algebras in terms of the apparently simpler objects of weights on half-sided modular inclusions, we lastly give some basic results for manipulations with such weights.},

The general techniques are applied to the quantum sine-Gordon model alias the massive Thirring model. Exact expressions of all matrix elements are obtained for several local operators. In particular soliton form factors of charge-less operators as for example all higher currents are investigated. It turns out that the various local operators correspond to specific scalar functions called p-functions. The identification of the local operators is performed. In particular the exact results are checked with Feynman graph expansion and full agreement is found. Furthermore all eigenvalues of the infinitely many conserved charges are calculated and the results agree with what is expected from the classical case. Within the frame work of integrable quantum field theories a general model independent `crossing' formula is derived. Furthermore the `bound state intertwiners' are introduced and the bound state form factors are investigated. The general results are again applied to the sine-Gordon model. The integrations are performed and in particular for the lowest breathers a simple formula for generalized form factors is obtained.},

In this article, this program is mainly illustrated in terms of the sinh-Gordon model and the SU(N) Gross-Neveu model. The nested off-shell Bethe ansatz for an SU(N) factorizing S-matrix is constructed. We review some previous results on sinh-Gordon form factors and the quantum operator field equation. The problem of how to sum over intermediate states is considered in the short distance limit of the two point Wightman function for the sinh-Gordon model.},

	abstract = {We discuss a formulation of quantum field theory on quantum space time where the perturbation expansion of the S-matrix is term by term ultraviolet finite. The characteristic feature of our approach is a quantum version of the Wick product at coinciding points: the differences of coordinates q\_j - \q\_k are not set equal to zero, which would violate the commutation relation between their components. We show that the optimal degree of approximate coincidence can be defined by the evaluation of a conditional expectation which replaces each function of\ q\_j \- q\_k by its expectation value in optimally localized states, while leaving the mean coordinate\s (q\_1 + ..\. + q\_n)/n invariant. The resulting procedure is to a large extent unique, and is invariant under translations and rotations, but violates Lorentz invariance. Indeed, optimal localization refers to a specific Lorentz frame, where the electric and magnetic parts of the commutator of the coordinates have to coincide *). Employing an adiabatic switching, we show that the S-matrix is term by term finite. The matrix elements of the transfer matrix are determined, at each order in the perturbative expansion, by kernels with Gaussian decay in the Planck scale. The adiabatic limit and the large scale limit of this theory will be studied elsewhere. -- *) S. Doplicher, K. Fredenhagen, and J.E.Roberts, Commun. Math.

	abstract = {Quantum field theories (QFT's) on noncommutative spacetimes are currently under intensive study. Usually such theories have world sheet noncommutativity. In the present work, instead, we study QFT's with commutative world sheet and noncommutative target space. Such noncommutativity can be interpreted in terms of twisted statistics and is related to earlier work of Oeckl [1], and others [2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. As an application, we analyse here free scalar field theories with the noncommutative plane as target space, and find the twisted spectra of their free Hamiltonians. The Hamiltonians of such free field theories contain an extra term proportional to a $z$-component angular momentum, resembling a coupling with a magnetic field. We analyse the energy spectrum of one such typical theory, and find that it is split (an effect similar to the Zeeman effect). Its partition function leads to a deformed black body spectrum, which is analysed in detail. The difference between the usual and the deformed black-body spectrum appears in the region of high frequence photons. Therefore we expect that the deformed black-body radiation may potentially be used to compute a GZK cut-off which will depend on the noncommutative parameter $\theta$.},

General properties of states over these algebras are discussed and theorems are given which connect the linked cluster property, translation invariance and the purity of the states. It is proved that pure states over the algebra of observables have the property of 'factorisable off-diagonal long range order'. The class of 'quasi free states' is defined and of these states those which are translation invariant and possess the linked cluster property are analysed. It is shown that this class of states contains a subclass of pure states of the Bogoliubov type and a subclass of states which are mixtures of non-translationally invariant pure states. The applications of these 'quasi free states' to the interacting Bose gas are summarized.},

Following the ideas of SouϊtiAU and SEGAL, but with some modifications, we show that it is possible to realize © as a concrete algebra of smooth transformations of the functionals Φ on the manifold 2!ΐ of smooth solutions to the classical equations of motion. It is even possible to do this in such a way that the action of a chosen dynamical variable, say the Hamiltonian, is given by the classical motion on the manifold, so that the quantum and classical motions coincide. In this realization, constant functionals are realized by multiples of the identity operator. For a finite number of degrees of freedom, n, the space of functionals can be made into a Hubert space Jf using the invariant Liouville volume element the dynamical variables F become operators F in this space. We prove that for any hamiltonian H quadratic in the canonical variables qx... qn> px... pn there exists a subspace ^f x C \& which is invariant under the action of pί9 qk and H, and such that the restriction of j)j, qk to ^>1 form an irreducible set of operators. Therefore, SOTJRIATT'S quantization rule agrees with the usual one for quadratic hamiltonians. In fact, it gives the Bargmann-Segal holo- morphic function realization. For non-linear problems in general, however, the operators pjf qk form a reducible set on any subspace of 3tf invariant under the action of the Hamiltonian. In particular this happens for H = -~-p2 -\- λq^. Therefore, SoTJRiAu's rule cannot agree with the usual quantization procedure for general non-linear systems. The method can be applied to the quantization of a non-linear wave equation and differs from the usual attempts in that (1) at any fixed time the field and its conjugate momentum may form a reducible set (2) the theory is less singular than usual. For a particular wave equation ( • + m2) Φiχ) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- λ φ3(x), we show heuristically that the interacting field may be defined as a first order differential operator acting on c°°-functions on the manifold of solutions. In order to make this space into a Hubert space, one must define a suitable method of functional integration on the manifold; this problem is discussed, without, however, arriving at a satisfactory conclusion.},

@article{BorchersSen:1990,
	abstract = {This is the first of a planned series of investigations on the theory of ordered spaces based upon four axioms. Two of these, the order (1.1.1) and the local structure (II.5.1) axioms provide the structure of the theory, and the other two [the identification (1.1.11) and cone (1.2.7) axioms] eliminate pathologies or excessive generality. In the present paper the axioms are supplemented by the nontriviality conditions (1.1.9) and a regularity property (II.4.2). The starting point is a nonempty set M and a family of distinguished subsets, called light rays, which are totally ordered. The order axiom provides the properties of this order. Positive and negative cones at a point are defined in terms of increasing and decreasing subsets and are used to extend the total order on the light rays to a partial order over all of M. The first significant result is the polygon lemma (1.2.3) which provides an essential constructive tool. A non-topological definition is found for the interiors of the cones; it leads to a ``more homogeneous'' partial order relation on M. In Sect. II, subsets called D-sets (Def. Π.2.2), possessing certain desirable properties, are studied. The key concept of perpendicularity of light rays is isolated (Def. II.3.1) and used to derive the basic ``separation properties,'' provided that the interiors of cones are nonempty. It is shown that, in a D-set, ``good'' properties of one cone can be transported along light rays, so that the structure of a D-set is homogeneous. In particular, if one cone has nonempty interior, so have all others. However, the existence of even one cone with nonempty interior does not follow from the axioms, but has to be imposed as an additional regularity condition. The local structure axiom now states that every point lies in a regular D-set. It is proved that the family of regular D-sets is closed under finite intersections. The order topology is defined as the topology which has this family as a base. This topology is Hausdorlf, and coincides with the usual topology for Minkowski spaces.},

The usual definition of commutative classical fields as sections of associated vector bundles on the homogeneous space does not generalise to the noncommutative setting, and the twisted Poincar\'{e} algebra does not act on noncommutative fields in a canonical way. We make a tentative proposal for the definition of noncommutative classical fields of any spin over the Moyal space, which has the desired representation theoretical properties. We also suggest a way to search for noncommutative Minkowski spaces suitable for studying noncommutative field theory with deformed Poincar\'{e} symmetries.},

	abstract = {We re-examine various issues surrounding the definition of twisted quantum field theories on flat noncommutative spaces. We propose an interpretation based on nonlocal commutative field redefinitions which clarifies previously observed properties such as the formal equivalence of Green's functions in the noncommutative and commutative theories, causality, and the absence of UV/IR mixing. We use these fields to define the functional integral formulation of twisted quantum field theory. We exploit techniques from braided tensor algebra to argue that the twisted Fock space states of these free fields obey conventional statistics. We support our claims with a detailed analysis of the modifications induced in the presence of background magnetic fields, which induces additional twists by magnetic translation operators and alters the effective noncommutative geometry seen by the twisted quantum fields. When two such field theories are dual to one another, we demonstrate that only our braided physical states are covariant under the duality.},

Thereby the extension of DHR theory to 1+1 dimensions due to Fredenhagen, Rehren and Schroer is vacuous for such theories. Even charged representations which are localizable only in wedge regions are ruled out. Furthermore, Haag duality holds in all locally normal representations. These results are applied to the theory of soliton sectors. Furthermore, the extension of localized representations of a non-Haag dual net to the dual net is reconsidered. It must be emphasized that these statements do not apply to massless theories since they do not satisfy the above split property. In particular, it is known that positive energy representations of conformally invariant theories are DHR representations.},

The $\kappa$-deformation of local free quantum fields originates from two sources: noncommutativity of space-time and the $\kappa$-deformation of field oscillators algebra - we relate these two deformations. We demonstrate that for suitable choice of $\kappa$-deformed field oscillators algebra the $\kappa$-deformed version of microcausality condition is satisfied, and it leads to the deformation of the Pauli-Jordan commutation function defined by the $\kappa$-deformed mass shell. We show by constructing the $\kappa$-deformed Fock space that the use of $\kappa$-deformed oscillator algebra permits to preserve the bosonic statistics of n-particle states. The proposed star product is extended to the product of $n$ fields, which for $n=4$ defines the interaction vertex in perturbative description of noncommutative quantum $\lambda\phi^4$ field theory.

This is not a coincidence but rather a structural consequence of the fact that both operator algebras are of the same unique von Neumann type which is completely different from that met in quantum mechanical algebras. Together with the technique of holographic projection this leads to the universal area proportionality. The main aim in this paper is to present another derivation which is more in the spirit of recent work on entanglement entropy in condensed matter physics especially that by Cardy and collaborators.

@techreport{IlievaThirring:1999,
	abstract = {Solutions to the Thirring model are constructed in the framework of algebraic QFT. It is shown that for all positive temperatures there are fermionic solutions only if the coupling constant is $\lambda=\sqrt{2(2n+1)\pi}, n\in {\bf N}$. These fermions are inequivalent and only for $n=1$ they are canonical fields. In the general case solutions are anyons. Different anyons (which are uncountably many) live in orthogonal spaces and obey dynamical equations (of the type of Heisenberg's ``Urgleichung'') characterized by the corresponding values of the statistic parameter. Thus statistic parameter turns out to be related to the coupling constant $\lambda$ and the whole Hilbert space becomes non-separable with a different ``Urgleichung'' satisfied in each of its sectors. This feature certainly cannot be seen by any power expansion in $\lambda$. Moreover, since the latter is tied to the statistic parameter, it is clear that such an expansion is doomed to failure and will never reveal the true structure of the theory. The correlation functions in the temperature state for the canonical dressed fermions are shown by us to coincide with the ones for bare fields, that is in agreement with the uniqueness of the $\tau$-KMS state over the CAR algebra ($\tau$ being the shift automorphism). Also the $\alpha$-anyon two-point function is evaluated and for scalar field it reproduces the result that is known from the literature.},

Our formula is model independent and its version in general Quantum Field Theory applies to black hole thermodynamics. The relative free energy between two thermal equilibrium states associated with a black hole turns out to be proportional to the variation of the conditional entropy in different superselection sectors, where the conditional entropy is defined as the Connes-Stoermer entropy associated with the DHR localized endomorphism representing the sector. The constant of proportionality is half of the Hawking temperature. As a consequence the relative free energy is quantized proportionally to the logarithm of a rational number, in particular it is equal to a linear function the logarithm of an integer once the initial state or the final state is taken fixed.},

Our approach is close to quantum field theory, with the elements of this group regarded as Bogoliubov transformations for fermions in an external Yang-Mills field. Though these cannot be unitarily implemented in the physically relevant representation of the fermion field algebra, we argue that they can be implemented by sesquilinear forms, and that there is a (regularized) product of forms providing an appropriate group structure. On the Lie algebra level, this gives an explicit, non-perturbative construction of fermion current algebras in (3 + 1) space-time dimensions which explicitly shows that the ``wave function renormalization'' required for a consistent definition of the currents and their Lie bracket naturally leads to the Schwinger term identical with the Mickelsson-Rajeev cocycle.

The scope of this modular framework is amazingly wide and ranges from providing a conceptual basis for the d=1+1 bootstrap-formfactor program for factorizable d=1+1 models to a decomposition theory of QFT's in terms of a finite collection of unitarily equivalent chiral conformal theories placed a specified relative position within a common Hilbert space (in d=1+1 a holographic relation and in higher dimensions more like a scanning).

Arguing that their field algebras do not admit any compactly localizable subalgebras, we are led to a situation of purely gravitating matter which cannot be registered in any particle counter.

The focus lies on dispersion relations in quantized interacting models in the Yang-- Feldman formalism. In particular, we compute the two--point correlation function of the field strength in noncommutative quantum electrodynamics to second order. At this, we take into account the covariant coordinates that allow the construction of local gauge invariant quantities (observables). It turns out that this does not remove the well--known severe infrared problem, as one might have hoped. Instead, things become worse, since nonlocal divergences appear. We also show that these cancel in a supersymmetric version of the theory if the covariant coordinates are adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, we study the φ3 and the Wess--Zumino model and show that the dis- tortion of the dispersion relations is moderate for parameters typical for the Higgs field. We also disuss the formulation of gauge theories on noncommutative spaces and study classical electrodynamics on the noncommutative Minkowski space using covariant co- ordinates. In particular, we compute the change of the speed of light due to nonlinear effects in the presence of a background field. Finally, we examine the so--called twist approach to quantum field theory on the noncommutative Minkowski space and point out some conceptual problems of this approach.},

	abstract = {A new approach to the model-independent description of quantum field theories will be introduced in the present work. The main feature of this new approach is to incorporate in a local sense the principle of general covariance of general relativity, thus giving rise to the concept of a "locally covariant quantum field theory". Such locally covariant quantum field theories will be described mathematically in terms of covariant functors between the categories, on one side, of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with isometric embeddings as morphisms and, on the other side, of *-algebras with unital injective *-endomorphisms as morphisms. Moreover, locally covariant quantum fields can be described in this framework as natural transformations between certain functors. The usual Haag-Kastler framework of nets of operator-algebras over a fixed spacetime background-manifold, together with covariant automorphic actions of the isometry-group of the background spacetime, can be re-gained from this new approach as a special case. Examples of this new approach are also outlined. In case that a locally covariant quantum field theory obeys the time-slice axiom, one can naturally associate to it certain automorphic actions, called ``relative Cauchy-evolutions'', which describe the dynamical reaction of the quantum field theory to a local change of spacetime background metrics. The functional derivative of a relative Cauchy-evolution with respect to the spacetime metric is found to be a divergence-free quantity which has, as will be demonstrated in an example, the significance of an energy-momentum tensor for the locally covariant quantum field theory. Furthermore, we discuss the functorial properties of state spaces of locally covariant quantum field theories that entail the validity of the principle of local definiteness.},

	abstract = {The bootstrap program for 1+1-dimensional integrable Quantum Field Theories (QFT{\rq}s) is developed to a large extent for the Homogeneous sine-Gordon (HSG) models. This program can be divided into various steps, which include the computation of the exact S-matrix, Form Factors of local operators and correlation functions, as well as the identification of the operator content of the QFT and the development of various consistency checks. Taking as an input the fairly recent S-matrix proposal for the HSG-models, we confirm its consistency by carrying out both a Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) and a Form Factor analysis, which allow for extracting the main characteristics of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) associated to these theories. In contrast to many other 1+1-dimensional integrable models studied in the literature, the HSG-models possess two remarkable features, namely the parity breaking, both at the level of the Lagrangian and S-matrix, as well as the presence of unstable particles in the spectrum. These features have specific consequences in our analysis which are given a physical interpretation. By exploiting the Form Factor approach, we develop further the QFT advocated to the HSG-models by evaluating correlation functions of various local operators of the model. We compute the renormalisation group (RG) flow of Zamolodchikov{\rq}s c-function and ∆-functions which carry information about the RG-flow of the operator content of the underlying CFT and provide a means for the identification of the operator content of the QFT. For these functions, as well as for the scaling function computed in the TBA-context, an {\lq}staircase{\rq} pattern which can be physically interpreted, by associating the different plateaux to energy scales for the onset of stable and/or unstable particles of the model, is found. For the SU (3)2 -HSG model we show how the form factors of different local operators are interrelated by means of the momentum space cluster property. We find closed formulae for all n-particle form factors of a large class of operators of the SU (N )2 -HSG models. These formulae are expressed in terms of universal building blocks which allow both a determinant and an integral representation.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new top down approach to canonical quantum gravity, called Algebraic Quantum Gravity (AQG): The quantum kinematics of AQG is determined by an abstract ∗−algebra generated by a countable set of elementary operators labelled by an algebraic graph. The quantum dynamics of AQG is governed by a single Master Constraint operator. While AQG is inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is fundamentally no topology or differential structure. A natural Hilbert space representation acquires the structure of an infinite tensor product (ITP) whose separable strong equivalence class Hilbert subspaces (sectors) are left invariant by the quantum dynamics. The missing information about the topology and differential structure of the spacetime manifold as well as about the background metric to be approximated is supplied by coherent states. Given such data, the corresponding coherent state defines a sector in the ITP which can be identified with a usual QFT on the given manifold and background. Thus, AQG contains QFT on all curved spacetimes at once, possibly has something to say about topology change and provides the contact with the familiar low energy physics. In particular, in two companion papers we develop semiclassical perturbation theory for AQG and LQG and thereby show that the theory admits a semiclassical limit whose infinitesimal gauge symmetry agrees with that of General Relativity. In AQG everything is computable with sufficient precision and no UV divergences arise due to the background independence of the fundamental combinatorial structure. Hence, in contrast to lattice gauge theory on a background metric, no continuum limit has to be taken, there simply is no lattice regulator that must be sent to zero.},

	abstract = {The mathematics of classical probability theory was subsumed into classical measure theory by Kolmogorov in 1933. Quantum theory as nonclassical probability theory was incorporated into the beginnings of noncommutative measure theory by von Neumann in the early thirties, as well. To precisely this end, von Neumann initiated the study of what are now called von Neumann algebras and, with Murray, made a first classification of such algebras into three types. The nonrelativistic quantum theory of systems with finitely many degrees of freedom deals exclusively with type I algebras. However, for the description of further quantum systems, the other types of von Neumann algebras are indispensable. The paper reviews quantum probability theory in terms of general von Neumann algebras, stressing the similarity of the conceptual structure of classical and noncommutative probability theories and emphasizing the correspondence between the classical and quantum concepts, though also indicating the nonclassical nature of quantum probabilistic predictions. In addition, differences between the probability theories in the type I, II and III settings are explained.

@misc{Schroer:2008-2,
	abstract = {Indecomposable positive energy quantum matter comes in three forms: one massive and two massless families of which about the so called ``infinite spin'' family was little known up to recently. Using novel methods which are particularly suited for problems of localization, it was shown that this quantum matter of the third kind cannot be generated by pointlike localized fields but rather needs semiinfinite stringlike generators. A milder form of darkness which only concerns string-localized potentials in a theory with pointlike generated observables emerges from a reformulation of nonabelian gauge theory. It is the main aim of this paper to show that the ``axial gauge'' which hitherto was considered as a special gauge for a massless vectorpotentials is not at all an object of gauge theory but rather a semiinfinite spacelike string-localized covariant quantum field in a physical Hilbert space. We suggest that this reinterpretation of gauge theory in which the pointlike unphysical BRST treatment is traded with interacting stringlike potentials could lead to a conservative (within the standard model) understanding of dark matter i.e. dark matter as the invisible energy-momentum carrying part of what used to be the gauge dependent part in the pointlike gauge dependent description. The clearest indication that the axial gauge interpretation was incorrect is that the vectorpotentials fluctuates in the string direction as well as in its endpoint.

	abstract = {Borchers has shown that in a translation covariant vacuum representation of a theory of local observables with positive energy the following holds: The (Tomita) modular objects associated with the observable algebra of a fixed wedge region give rise to a representation of the subgroup of the Poincare group generated by the boosts and the reflection associated to the wedge, and the translations. We prove here that Borchers' theorem also holds in charged sectors with (possibly non-Abelian) braid group statistics in low space-time dimensions. Our result is a crucial step towards the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem for Plektons in d=3, namely that the mentioned modular objects generate a representation of the proper Poincare group, including a CPT operator. Our main assumptions are Haag duality of the observable algebra, and translation covariance with positive energy as well as finite statistics of the sector under consideration.},

Using methods of the theory of distributions, we precisely describe the support properties of the commutator [O(x),O(y)] and prove that, in the case of space-space noncommutativity, it does not vanish at spacelike separation in the noncommuting directions. However, the matrix elements of this commutator exhibit a rapid falloff along an arbitrary spacelike direction irrespective of the type of noncommutativity. We also consider the star commutator for this observable and show that it fails to vanish even at spacelike separation in the commuting directions and completely violates causality. We conclude with a brief discussion about the modified Wightman functions which are vacuum expectation values of the star products of fields at different spacetime points.},

	abstract = {We show that despite the inherent non-locality of quantum field theories on the Groenewold-Moyal (GM) plane, one can find a class of ${\bf C}$, ${\bf P}$, ${\bf T}$ and ${\bf CPT}$ invariant theories. In particular, these are theories without gauge fields or with just gauge fields and no matter fields. We also show that in the presence of gauge fields, one can have a field theory where the Hamiltonian is ${\bf C}$ and ${\bf T}$ invariant while the $S$-matrix violates ${\bf P}$ and ${\bf CPT}$. In non-abelian gauge theories with matter fields such as the electro-weak and $QCD$ sectors of the standard model of particle physics, ${\bf C}$, ${\bf P}$, ${\bf T}$ and the product of any pair of them are broken while ${\bf CPT}$ remains intact for the case $\theta^{0i} =0$. (Here $x^ \star x^ - x^ \star x^ = i \theta^{\mu \nu}$, $x^$: coordinate functions, $\theta^{\mu \nu} = -\theta^{\nu \mu}=$ constant.) When $\theta^{0i} \neq 0$, it contributes to breaking also ${\bf P}$ and ${\bf CPT}$. It is known that the $S$-matrix in a non-abelian theory depends on $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ only through $\theta^{0i}$. The $S$-matrix is frame dependent. It breaks (the identity component of the) Lorentz group. All the noncommutative effects vanish if the scattering takes place in the center-of-mass frame, or any frame where $\theta^{0i}P^{\textrm{in}}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_{i} = 0$, but not otherwise. ${\bf P}$ and ${\bf CPT}$ are good symmetries of the theory in this special case.},

In particular, we completely clarify the relation between the asymptotic commutativity condition, which ensures the CPT symmetry and the standard spin-statistics relation for nonlocal fields, and the regularity properties of the retarded Green's functions in momentum space that are required for constructing a scattering theory and deriving reduction formulas. This result is based on a relevant Paley-Wiener-Schwartz-type theorem for analytic functionals. We also discuss the possibility of using analytic test functions to extend the Wightman axioms to noncommutative field theory, where the causal structure with the light cone is replaced by that with the light wedge.

Use of the proper-time method allows to represent these functions as multiple Wiener integrals of functionals that obey infinite systems of coupled integral equations which are similar to, and for the particular model of a complex scalar field in quadrilinear self-interaction considered here a limiting case of, systems studied in quantum statistical mechanics by Ginibre. As a consequence, the Euclidean Green's functions can for this model be obtained by a limiting process, with temperature and density going to infinity, from the reduced density matrices of a nonrelativistic Bose gas. Reduced functionals are defined and their equations determined as a prepartory step to renormalization in the super-renormalizable cases of two and three dimensions.},

The modular flows associated with the algebras of the forward light cone and a space-like wedge admit a simple geometric description in two dimensional models that factorize in light-cone coordinates. At large distances from the domain boundary compared to the inverse temperature the flow pattern is essentially the same as time translations, whereas the zero temperature results are approximately reproduced close to the edge of the wedge and the apex of the cone. Associated with each domain there is also a one parameter group with a positive generator, for which the thermal state is a ground state.

Using Landstad theory of crossed product we get a deformed $\C^*$-algebra $A^\Psi$. In case of $\Gamma=\mathbb{R}^n$ we obtain a very simple proof of invariance of $\mathcal{K}$-groups under the deformation. In any case we get a simple proof that nuclearity is preserved under the deformation. We show how Rieffel deformation leads to quantum groups and investigate the duality. The general theory is illustrated by an example of deformation of $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$.

The computation of the local commutant is exemplified in various situations leading to the physically reasonable distinction between thermal representations and pure ones.

In particular, a novel decomposition of the algebra of local observables into spectral subspaces is constructed. Apart from the counterparts of the pure-point and absolutely continuous subspaces, familiar from the spectral theory of operators, there appears a new 'point-continuous' subspace. It belongs to the singular-continuous part of the decomposition, but is finite-dimensional in a large class of models; its dimension carries information about the infrared structure of a theory. It is shown that this point-continuous subspace is trivial in all theories complying with a regularity condition proposed in this work. Moreover, this condition entails the existence of particles if the theory admits a stress-energy tensor. The uniqueness of the decomposition of the algebra of observables into the pure-point and continuous subspace is established by proving an ergodic theorem for automorphism groups. The proof is based on physically motivated phase space conditions which have a number of interesting consequences pertaining to the vacuum structure such as the convergence of physical states to a unique vacuum under large timelike translations.},

We show that the tensor nature of theta is only hidden in the formalism: in particular if theta fulfils the DFR conditions, the twisted Lorentz covariant model of the flat quantum spacetime may be equivalently described in terms of the DFR model, if we agree to discard a huge non invariant set of localisation states; it is only this last step which, if taken as a basic assumption, severely breaks the relativity principle. We also will show that the above mentioned, relativity breaking, ad hoc rejection of localisation states is an independent, unnecessary assumption, as far as some popular approaches to quantum field theory on the quantum Minkowski spacetime are concerned. The above should raise some concerns about speculations on possible observable consequences of arbitrary choices of theta in arbitrarily selected privileged frames.},

	abstract = {The quantized free Dirac field is considered on Minkowski spacetime (of general dimension). The Dirac field is coupled to an external scalar potential whose support is finite in time and which acts by a Moyal-deformed multiplication with respect to the spatial variables. The Moyal-deformed multiplication corresponds to the product of the algebra of a Moyal plane described in the setting of spectral geometry. It will be explained how this leads to an interpretation of the Dirac field as a quantum field theory on Moyal-deformed Minkowski spacetime (with commutative time) in a setting of Lorentzian spectral geometries of which some basic aspects will be sketched. The scattering transformation will be shown to be unitarily implementable in the canonical vacuum representation of the Dirac field. Furthermore, it will be indicated how the functional derivatives of the ensuing unitary scattering operators with respect to the strength of the non-commutative potential induce, in the spirit of Bogoliubov's formula, quantum field operators (corresponding to observables) depending on the elements of the non-commutative algebra of Moyal-Minkowski spacetime.},

The consistency conditions that we consider are "associativity" or "factorization" conditions on the operator product expansion (OPE) of the theory, and are proposed to be the defining property of any quantum field theory. Our framework is presented in the Euclidean setting, and is applicable in principle to any quantum field theory, including non-conformal ones. In our framework, we obtain a characterization of perturbations of a given quantum field theory in terms of a certain cohomology ring of Hochschild-type. We illustrate our framework by the free field, but our constructions are general and apply also to interacting quantum field theories. For such theories, we propose a new scheme to construct the OPE which is based on the use of non-linear quantized field equations.},

Such theories violate causality which influences the properties of these theories. In particular, causality influences the fluctuation-dissipation theorem: as we show, a disturbance in a space-time region $M\_1$ creates a response in a space-time region $M\_2$ space-like with respect to $M\_1$ ($M\_1\times M\_2$). The relativistic Kubo formula with and without noncommutativity is discussed in detail, and the modified properties of relaxation time and the dependence of mean square fluctuations on time are derived. In particular, the Sinha-Sorkin result \cite{sorkin-sinha} on the logarithmic time dependence of the mean square fluctuations is discussed in our context. We derive an exact formula for the noncommutative susceptibility in terms of the susceptibility for the corresponding commutative case. It shows that noncommutative corrections in the four-momentum space have remarkable periodicity properties as a function of the four-momentum $k$. They have direction dependence as well and vanish for certain directions of the spatial momentum. These are striking observable signals for noncommutativity. The Lehmann representation is also generalized to any value of the noncommutativity parameter $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ and finite temperatures.},

Contrary to what one might expect, this construction does not provide a connection to the popular traditional Euclidean approach to noncommutative field theory (unless the time variable is assumed to commute). Instead, one finds Schwinger functions with twistings involving only momenta that are on the mass-shell. This explains why renormalization in the traditional Euclidean noncommutative framework crudely differs from renormalization in the Minkowskian regime.},

@misc{Schroer:2009-2,
	abstract = {It is often overlooked that local quantum physics has a built in quantum localization structure which may under certain circumstances disagree with (differential, algebraic) geometric ideas. String theory originated from such a spectacular misinterpretation of a source-target embedding in which an inner symmetry of the source object becomes the Lorentz symmetry of the target space. The quantum localization reveals however that the resulting object is an infinite component pointlike field. There are also other other areas in QFT which suffered from having followed geometrical metaphors and payed too little attention to the autonomous localization properties. This will be illustrated in the concrete context of three examples. We also show that "modular localization ", i.e. the intrinsic localization theory of local quantum quantum physics, leads to a radiacal new way of looking at (nonperturbative) QFT. For the first time in the history of QFT there are now existence theorems for a class of strictly renormalizable (i.e. not superrenormalizable) factorizable QFTs which are based on these new concepts. The paper ends with some worrisome sociological observations about the state of particle physics and the direction in which it is heading. These remarks are based on the results presented in the three previous sections.},

We show that in an enlarged system where the time variable denotes an additional degree of freedom, solutions of the Schroedinger equation give rise to weights on the enlarged algebra of observables. States in the associated GNS representation correspond to states on the original algebra composed with a completely positive unit preserving map. Application of this map to the functions of the time operator on the large system delivers the positive operator valued maps which were previously proposed by two of us as time observables. As an example we discuss the application of this formalism to the Wheeler-DeWitt theory of a scalar field on a Robertson-Walker spacetime.},

This allows for explicitly computing the trace of a quantised function of spacetime. Moreover, we show that in the classical (i.e. large scale) limit the origin of space is a topologically isolated point, so that the resulting classical spacetime is disconnected. Finally we show that there exist states with arbitrarily sharp simultaneous localisation in all the coordinates; in other words, an arbitrarily high energy density can be transferred to spacetime by means of localisation alone, which amounts to say that the model is not stable under localisation.},

Moreover, the device can be used for the deformation of relativistic quantum field theories by adjusting the convolutions to the geometry of Minkowski space.

The basic requirements are to preserve the commutation relations of the coordinates as well as the associativity of the new product. We show that a modification of the differential representation of the Weyl-Moyal star-product by an exponential function of derivatives will not lead to a finite range of nonlocality. We also modify the integral kernel of the star-product introducing a Gaussian damping, but find a nonassociative product which remains infinitely nonlocal. We are therefore led to propose that the Weyl-Moyal product should be modified by a cutoff like function, in order to remove the infinite nonlocality of the product. We provide such a product, but it appears that one has to abandon the possibility of analytic calculation with the new product.},

Particle weights arise as temporal limits of physical states in the vacuum sector and describe the asymptotic particle content. Following a thorough analysis of the underlying notion of localizing operators, we give a precise definition of this concept and investigate the characteristic properties. The decomposition of particle weights into pure components which are linked to irreducible representations of the quasi-local algebra has been a long-standing desideratum that only recently found its solution. We set out two approaches to this problem by way of disintegration theory, making use of a physically motivated assumption concerning the structure of phase space in quantum field theory. The significance of the pure particle weights ensuing from this disintegration is founded on the fact that they exhibit features of improper energy-momentum eigenstates, analogous to Dirac's conception, and permit a consistent definition of mass and spin even in an infraparticle situation.},

In particular this applies to the real free scalar field and the result has applications in perturbative quantum field theory, showing that the class of all Hadamard states is the state space of interest. In our proof we assume that the field is a generalised free field, i.e. that it satisies scalar (c-number) commutation relations, but it need not satisfy an equation of motion. The same argument also works for anti-commutation relations and it can be generalised to vector-valued fields. To indicate the strengths and limitations of our assumption we also prove the analogues of a theorem by Borchers and Zimmermann on the self-adjointness of field operators and of a very weak form of the Jost-Schroer theorem. The original proofs of these results in the Wightman framework make use of analytic continuation arguments. In our case no analyticity is assumed, but to some extent the scalar commutation relations can take its place.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the algebraic formulation, we discuss and analyse some new features of the local structure of a real scalar quantum field theory in a strongly causal spacetime. In particular we use the properties of the exponential map to set up a local version of a bulk-to-boundary correspondence. The bulk is a suitable subset of a geodesic neighbourhood of any but fixed point p of the underlying background, while the boundary is a part of the future light cone having p as its own tip. In this regime, we provide a novel notion for the extended *-algebra of Wick polynomials on the said cone and, on the one hand, we prove that it contains the information of the bulk counterpart via an injective *-homomorphism while, on the other hand, we associate to it a distinguished state whose pull-back in the bulk is of Hadamard form. The main advantage of this point of view arises if one uses the universal properties of the exponential map and of the light cone in order to show that, for any two given backgrounds M and M' and for any two subsets of geodesic neighbourhoods of two arbitrary points, it is possible to engineer the above procedure such that the boundary extended algebras are related via a restriction homomorphism. This allows for the pull-back of boundary states in both spacetimes and, thus, to set up a machinery which permits the comparison of expectation values of local field observables in M and M'.},

	abstract = {In this paper we generalize the construction of generally covariant quantum theories given in the work of Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch to encompass the conformal covariant case. After introducing the abstract framework, we discuss the massless conformally coupled Klein Gordon field theory, showing that its quantization corresponds to a functor between two certain categories. At the abstract level, the ordinary fields, could be thought as natural transformations in the sense of category theory. We show that, the Wick monomials without derivatives (Wick powers), can be interpreted as fields in this generalized sense, provided a non trivial choice of the renormalization constants is given. A careful analysis shows that the transformation law of Wick powers is characterized by a weight, and it turns out that the sum of fields with different weights breaks the conformal covariance. At this point there is a difference between the previously given picture due to the presence of a bigger group of covariance. It is furthermore shown that the construction does not depend upon the scale mu appearing in the Hadamard parametrix, used to regularize the fields. Finally, we briefly discuss some further examples of more involved fields.},

If H were only achronal, counterexamples to the smooth extension exist, but a continuous extension (in fact, valid for any compact achronal subset K) is still possible. (2) Given any spacelike Cauchy hypersurface S, a Cauchy temporal function T (i.e., a smooth function with past-directed timelike gradient everywhere, and Cauchy hypersurfaces as levels) with S equal to one of the levels, is constructed -thus, the spacetime splits orthogonally as $R \times S$ in a canonical way.

A certain type of spectral geometries modelling (possibly noncommutative) globally hyperbolic spacetimes is introduced in terms of so-called globally hyperbolic spectral triples. The concept is further generalized to a category of globally hyperbolic spectral geometries whose morphisms describe the generalization of isometric embeddings. Then a local generally covariant quantum field theory is introduced as a covariant functor between such a category of globally hyperbolic spectral geometries and the category of involutive algebras (or *-algebras). Thus, a local covariant quantum field theory over spectral geometries assigns quantum fields not just to a single noncommutative geometry (or noncommutative spacetime), but simultaneously to ``all'' spectral geometries, while respecting the covariance principle demanding that quantum field theories over isomorphic spectral geometries should also be isomorphic. It is suggested that in a quantum theory of gravity a particular class of globally hyperbolic spectral geometries is selected through a dynamical coupling of geometry and matter compatible with the covariance principle.},

The triple involves an algebra of holonomy loops and a Dirac type operator which resembles a global functional derivation operator. The interaction between the Dirac operator and the algebra reproduces the Poisson structure of General Relativity. Moreover, the associated Hilbert space corresponds, up to a discrete symmetry group, to the Hilbert space of diffeomorphism invariant states known from Loop Quantum Gravity. Correspondingly, the square of the Dirac operator has, in terms of canonical quantum gravity, the form of a global area-squared operator. Furthermore, the spectral action resembles a partition function of Quantum Gravity. The construction is background independent and is based on an inductive system of triangulations. This paper is the first of two papers on the subject.},

The algebraic relations remain the same, whereas the comultiplication rule (Leibniz rule) is different from the undeformed one. Based on this deformed algebra a covariant tensor calculus is constructed and all the concepts like metric, covariant derivatives, curvature and torsion can be defined on the deformed space as well. The construction of these geometric quantities is presented in detail. This leads to an action invariant under the deformed diffeomorphism algebra and can be interpreted as a theta-deformed Einstein-Hilbert action. The metric or the vierbein field will be the dynamical variable as they are in the undeformed theory. The action and all relevant quantities are expanded up to second order in theta.},

	abstract = {We develop the first steps towards an analysis of geometry on the quantum spacetime proposed in [1]. The homogeneous elements of the universal differential algebra are naturally identified with operators living in tensor powers of Quantum Spacetime; this allows us to compute their spectra. In particular, we consider operators that can be interpreted as distances, areas, 3- and 4-volumes. The Minkowski distance operator between two independent events is shown to have pure Lebesgue spectrum with infinite multiplicity. The Euclidean distance operator is shown to have spectrum bounded below by a constant of the order of the Planck length. The corresponding statement is proved also for both the space-space and space-time area operators, as well as for the Euclidean length of the vector representing the 3-volume operators. However, the space 3-volume operator (the time component of that vector) is shown to have spectrum equal to the whole complex plane. All these operators are normal, while the distance operators are also selfadjoint. The Lorentz invariant spacetime volume operator, representing the 4- volume spanned by five independent events, is shown to be normal. Its spectrum is pure point with a finite distance (of the order of the fourth power of the Planck length) away from the origin. The mathematical formalism apt to these problems is developed and its relation to a general formulation of Gauge Theories on Quantum Spaces is outlined. As a byproduct, a Hodge Duality between the absolute dif- ferential and the Hochschild boundary is pointed out.},

We show the two formulations to agree in chiral Conformal QFT and, starting from the trace class condition for the semigroup generated by the conformal Hamiltonian L\_0, we infer and naturally estimate the Buchholz-Wichmann nuclearity condition and the (distal) split property. As a corollary, if \L\_0 is log-elliptic, the Buchholz-Junglas set up is realized and so there exists a beta-KMS state for the translation dynamics on the net of C*-algebras for every inverse temperature beta>0.

We argue that an accelerating frame may be similarly defined (i.e. as a sequence of instantaneous Lorentz transformations) in noncommutative Moyal spacetime, and discuss the twisted quantum field theory appropriate for such an accelerated observer. Our analysis shows that there are several new features in the case of noncommutative spacetime: chiral massless fields in $(1+1)$ dimensions have a qualitatively different behavior compared to massive fields. In addition, the vacuum of the inertial observer is no longer an equilibrium thermal state of the accelerating observer, and the Bose-Einstein distribution acquires $\theta$-dependent corrections.},

More precisely, if for two models there is unitary connecting all of these algebras, then ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- without assuming that this unitary also connects their respective vacuum states or spacetime symmetry representations ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- it follows that the two models are equivalent. This result might be viewed as an algebraic version of the celebrated theorem of Rudolf Haag about problems regarding the so-called "interaction-picture" in QFT. Original motivation of the author for finding such an algebraic version came from conformal chiral QFT. Both the chiral case as well as a related conjecture about standard half-sided modular inclusions will be also discussed.},

Descriptions of particles propagating and interacting in spacetimes are constructed by observers, but different observers, separated from each other by translations, construct different spacetime projections from the invariant phase space. Nonetheless, all observers agree that interactions are local in the spacetime coordinates constructed by observers local to them. This framework, in which absolute locality is replaced by relative locality, results from deforming momentum space, just as the passage from absolute to relative simultaneity results from deforming the linear addition of velocities. Different aspects of momentum space geometry, such as its curvature, torsion and non-metricity, are reflected in different kinds of deformations of the energy-momentum conservation laws. These are in principle all measurable by appropriate experiments. We also discuss a natural set of physical hypotheses which singles out the cases of momentum space with a metric compatible connection and constant curvature.},

Our first construction is canonical, starting with a local conformal net on the real line, and is analogous to our previous construction of local boundary CFT nets on the Minkowski half-space. This net is in a thermal state at Hawking temperature. Then, inspired by a recent construction by E. Witten and one of us, we consider a unitary semigroup that we use to build up infinitely many nets. Surprisingly, the one-particle semigroup is again isomorphic to the semigroup of symmetric inner functions of the disk. In particular, by considering the U(1)-current net, we can associate with any given symmetric inner function a local, boundary QFT net on LH. By considering different states, we shall also have nets in a ground state, rather than in a KMS state.},

The expectation values of interesting quantities are usually given in terms of euclidean correlation functions from which one should be able to extract information about the behavior of the correlation functions of the Minkowskian counterpart. We think that the C*-algebraic approach to euclidean field theory gives an appropriate setup in order to study structural aspects model independently. A previous paper deals with a construction scheme which relates to each euclidean field theory a Poincar\'{e} covariant quantum field theory model in the sense of R. Haag and D. Kastler. Within the framework of R. Haag and D. Kastler, the physical concept of PCT symmetry and spin and statistics is related to the Tomita-Takesaki theory of von Neumann algebras and this important aspects has been studied by several authors. We express the PCT symmetry in terms of euclidean reflexions and we explicitly identify the corresponding modular operator and the modular conjugation of the related Tomita-Takesaki theory. Locality, wedge duality, and a geometric action of the modular group of the von Neumann algebra of observables, localized within a wedge region in Minkowski space, are direct consequences.},

	abstract = {We describe in a qualitative way a possible picture of the Measurement Process in Quantum Mechanics, which takes into account: 1. the finite and non zero time duration T of the interaction between the observed system and the *microscopic part* of the measurement apparatus; 2. the finite space size R of that apparatus; 3. the fact that the *macroscopic part* of the measurement apparatus, having the role of amplifying the effect of that interaction to a macroscopic scale, is composed by a very large but finite number N of particles. The conventional picture of the measurement, as an instantaneous action turning a pure state into a mixture, arises only in the limit where N tends to infinity, T tends to zero, R tends to infinity. The limit where N tends to infinity has been often discussed as the origin of decoherence. We argue here that, as a consequence of the Principle of Locality, before those three limits are taken, no long range entanglement between the values of observables which are spacelike separated far away can be detected (although entangled states for such observables are well known to exist in local theories, simple examples are given in an Appendix). In order to detect correlations, one of the observers has to wait until he enters the future causal shadow of the region employed by the apparatus of the other. Accordingly, in this picture of the measurement process there would be no Einstein Podolski Rosen Paradox. (Similar views had been proposed already [6], [22]). A careful comparison with the growing experimental results of the recent decades might settle the question.},

	abstract = {Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch (BFV) have shown how the notion of local covariance for quantum field theories can be formulated in terms of category theory: a theory being described as a functor from a category of spacetimes to a category of $(C)^*$-algebras. We discuss whether this condition is sufficient to guarantee that a theory represents `the same physics' in all spacetimes, giving examples to show that it does not. A new criterion, dynamical locality, is formulated, which requires that descriptions of local physics based on kinematical and dynamical considerations should coincide. Various applications are given, including a proof that dynamical locality for quantum fields is incompatible with the possibility of covariantly choosing a preferred state in each spacetime. As part of this discussion we state a precise condition that should hold on any class of theories each representing the same physics in all spacetimes. This condition holds for the dynamically local theories but is violated by the full class of locally covariant theories in the BFV sense. The majority of results described form part of forthcoming papers with Rainer Verch.},

	abstract = {The question of what it means for a theory to describe the same physics on different spacetimes (of the same dimension) is discussed. To this end, a previously introduced functorial description of locally covariant quantum field theories is analyzed and considerably extended. We assert a necessary criterion for a class of locally covariant theories to be regarded as being comprised of theories describing the same physics in all spacetimes (SPASs): Essentially, this demands that any two theories in the class that are isomorphic on some particular spacetime should be isomorphic on all (globally hyperbolic) spacetimes. By an explicit construction, we show that the full class of locally covariant theories does not satisfy the SPASs criterion and admits theories with different physical content in different spacetimes. The SPASs condition is formulated in a functorial setting broad enough to not only include quantum field theories, but any physical theories describing processes in spacetime, subject to only very minimal assumptions. It is also shown that all locally covariant theories possess two local substructures, one kinematical (obtained directly from the functorial structure) and the other dynamical. The latter results from a natural form of dynamics, termed relative Cauchy evolution, which appears in any local covariant theory fulfilling the time-slice axiom. The covariance properties of relative Cauchy evolution and the kinematic and dynamical substructures are analyzed in detail. Calling local covariant theories dynamically local if their kinematical and dynamical local substructures coincide, it is shown that the class of dynamically local theories fulfills the SPASs criterion. As an application in quantum field theory, we give a model independent proof of the impossibility of making a covariant choice of preferred state in all spacetimes, for theories obeying typical assumptions.},

In particular, we prove a long-standing conjecture that says that the generators of the mentioned actions differ by a pseudo-differential operator of order zero. To get that, one needs a careful analysis of the interplay of the theories in the bulk and at the boundary of double cones (a.k.a. diamonds). After introducing some technicalities, we prove the crucial result that the vacuum state for massive bosons in the bulk of a double cone restricts to a KMS state at its boundary, and that the restriction of the algebra at the boundary does not depend anymore on the mass. The origin of such result lies in a careful treatment of classical Cauchy and Goursat problems for the Klein-Gordon equation as well as the application of known general mathematical techniques, concerning the interplay of algebraic structures related with the bulk and algebraic structures related with the boundary of the double cone, arising from quantum field theories in curved spacetime. Our procedure gives explicit formulas for the modular group and its generator in terms of integral operators acting on symplectic space of solutions of massive Klein-Gordon Cauchy problem.},

Considering K as a partially ordered set (poset) with respect to the inclusion order relation, we define groups of closed paths (loops) formed by the elements of K. These groups come equipped with a causal disjointness relation and an action of the symmetry group of the spacetime. In this way the local algebras of the net are the group C*-algebras of the groups of loops, quotiented by the causal disjointness relation. We also provide a geometric interpretation of a class of representations of this net in terms of causal and covariant connections of the poset K. In the case of the Minkowski spacetime, we prove the existence of Poincar\'{e} covariant representations satisfying the spectrum condition. This is obtained by virtue of a remarkable feature of our construction: any Hermitian scalar quantum field defines causal and covariant connections of K.

One is "dynamical" and generalizes the solvability in closed form known from the Kepler two-body problem and its quantum mechanical counterpart. The other, referred to as kinematical integrability, has no classical nor quantum mechanical counterpart; it describes the relation between observable algebras and their inequivalent representation classes in form of a discrete algebra describing the a group dual or a braid group representation. The dynamical integrability is defined in terms of properties of wedge localization and uses the fact that modular localization theory allows to "emulate" the application of operators of the incoming wedge-localized interaction-free algebra inside the corresponding interacting algebra. Emulation can be viewed as a kind of generalization of the intrinsic (no Lagrangian quantization) Wigner particle representation theory to interacting systems. It also leads to a profound understanding of crossing in particle physics and places it into sharp difference to the kind of crossing used in the dual model and string theory. Discrete integrability has a particular interesting realization in higher dimensional conformal theories where the spectrum of anomalous scale dimensions turns out to be a special aspect of this integrability. In its formulation the Huygens principle (timelike commutation) of observables play an important role. Since QFT is the theory which arises from the principle of causal localization, dynamical as well as discrete integrability have their foundational origin in localization.},

Such positive energy evolutions always exist as noncommutative flows, but have only a partial geometric meaning, yet they map localized observables into localized observables. We characterize the local conformal nets on dS^d. Only in this case our positive energy evolutions have a complete geometrical meaning. We show that each net has a unique maximal expected conformal subnet, where our evolutions are thus geometrical. In the two-dimensional case, we construct a holographic one-to-one correspondence between local nets A on dS^2 and local conformal non-isotonic families (pseudonets) B on S^1. The pseudonet B gives rise to two local conformal nets B(+/-) on S^1, that correspond to the H(+/-)-horizon components of A, and to the chiral components of the maximal conformal subnet of A. In particular, A is holographically reconstructed by a single horizon component, namely the pseudonet is a net, iff the translations on H(+/-) have positive energy and the translations on H(-/+) are trivial. This is the case iff the one-parameter unitary group implementing rotations on dS^2 has positive/negative generator.},

In particular, there has been discovered a family of models based on the endomorphisms of the U(1)-current algebra of Longo-Witten. In this second part, we further investigate endomorphisms and interacting models. The key ingredient is the free massless fermionic net, which contains the U(1)-current net as the fixed point subnet with respect to the U(1) gauge action. Through the restriction to the subnet, we construct a new family of Longo-Witten endomorphisms on the U(1)-current net and accordingly interacting wedge-local nets in two-dimensional spacetime. The U(1)-current net admits the structure of particle numbers and the S-matrices of the models constructed here can be naturally interpreted to represent particle productions.},

The corresponding propagators are calculated and identified with the Feynman propagators of the field theories. The regulated quantum field theories are shown to be UV/IR-duality covariant.

The results are found to be very different from those in the naive approach pursued in the literature. A simple framework then appears naturally which can incorporate the new features of our results and which turns out to be the usual time-ordered perturbation theory extended to the NC context. We provide the prescriptions for computing S-matrix elements and Green functions in this framework. We also emphasize that the naive seemingly covariant approach cannot be reproduced from the current one, in contrast to the field theory on ordinary spacetime. We attribute this to the phase-like nonlocal interaction intrinsic in NC field theory which modifies the analytic properties of Green functions significantly.},

First, we show that any four-dimensional spacetime which admits two commuting and spacelike Killing vector fields carries a family of wedge regions with causal properties analogous to the Minkowski space wedges. Deformations of quantum field theories on these spacetimes are carried out within the operator-algebraic framework - the emerging models share many structural properties with deformations of field theories on flat spacetime. In particular, deformed quantum fields are localized in the wedges of the considered spacetime. As a concrete example, the deformation of the free Dirac field is studied. Second, quantum field theories on de Sitter spacetime with global U(1) gauge symmetry are deformed using the joint action of the internal symmetry group and a one-parameter group of boosts. The resulting theories turn out to be wedge-local and non-isomorphic to the initial one for a class of theories, including the free charged Dirac field. The properties of deformed models coming from inclusions of CAR-algebras are studied in detail. Third, the deformation of the scalar free field in the Araki-Wood representation on Minkowski spacetime is discussed as a motivating example.},

	abstract = {  We study the metric aspect of the Moyal plane from Connes' noncommutative
geometry point of view. First, we compute Connes' spectral distance associated
with the natural isometric action of R^2 on the algebra of the Moyal plane A.
We show that the distance between any state of A and any of its translated is
precisely the amplitude of the translation. As a side result, we obtain the
spectral distance between coherent states of the quantum harmonic oscillator as
the Euclidean distance on the plane, multiplied by the Planck length. Second,
we compute the spectral distance in the double Moyal plane, intended as the
product - in the sense of spectral triples - of (the minimal unitization of) A
by C^2. On the set of states obtained by translation of an arbitrary state of
A, this distance is given by Pythagoras theorem. Applied to the
Doplicher-Fredenhagen-Roberts model of quantum spacetime [DFR], these two
theorems show that Connes' spectral distance and the DFR quantum length
coincide on the set of states of optimal localization. On the way, we also
prove some Pythagoras inequalities for the product of arbitrary unital \&amp;
non-degenerate spectral triples. Some of the results of this paper can be

By using the algebraic and topological properties of these fields we prove that this construction makes sense and show in physical examples that standard representations such as the Bargmann and Schr\"{o}dinger representation come out correctly, both formally and in a suitable convergence scheme. For certain Hamiltonian functions (contained in the Gel'fand ideal of the positive functional) a formal solution to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation is shown to exist. Moreover, we show that for every K\"{a}hler manifold equipped with the Fedosov star product of Wick type all the classical delta functionals are positive and give rise to some formal Bargmann representation of the deformed algebra.},

	abstract = {  The crossing property is perhaps the most subtle aspect of the particle-field
relation. Although it is not difficult to state its content in terms of certain
analytic properties relating different matrixelements of the S-matrix or
formfactors, its relation to the localization- and positive energy spectral
principles requires a level of insight into the inner workings of QFT which
goes beyond anything which can be found in typical textbooks on QFT. This paper
presents a recent account based on new ideas derived from "modular
localization" including a mathematic appendix on this subject. Its main novel
achievement is the proof of the crossing property of formfactors from a
two-algebra generalization of the KMS condition. The main content of this
article is the presentation of the derailments of particle theory during more
than 4 decades: the S-matrix bootstrap, the dual model and its string theoretic
extension. Rather than being related to crossing, string theory is the (only
known) realization of a dynamic infinite component one-particle wave function
space and its associated infinite component field. Here "dynamic" means that,
unlike a mere collection of infinitely many irreducible unitary Poincar\'{e}
group representation or free fields, the formalism contains also operators
which communicate between the different irreducible Poincar\'{e} represenations
(the levels of the "infinite tower") and set the mass/spin spectrum. Wheras in
pre-string times there were unsuccessful attempts to achieve this in analogy to
the O(4,2) hydrogen spectrum by the use of higher noncompact groups, the
superstring in d=9+1, which uses instead (bosonic/fermionic) oscillators
obtained from multicomponent chiral currents is the only known unitary positive
energy solution of the dynamical infinite component pointlike localized field
project.

@misc{Hillier:2012,
	abstract = {  Motivated by a few preceding works, we introduce super-KMS functionals for
graded-local conformal nets with superderivations, roughly speaking as a
certain supersymmetric modification of classical KMS states on local conformal
nets. Although we are able to make several surprising statements concerning
their general structure, most properties will be studied in the setting of
individual models. In particular, we provide a constructive existence and
partial uniqueness proof of super-KMS functionals for the supersymmetric free
field in d dimensions, for its rational extensions, and for the super-Virasoro
net. As a general tool we develop a quasi-equivalence criterion for certain
functionals on the CAR algebra in the sense of Araki. Moreover, we show that
super-KMS functionals - as one of their main applications - give rise to
generalized perturbation-invariant entire cyclic (JLO) cocycles and thus to a
connection with noncommutative geometry.

@article{BuchholzGrundling:2007_2,
	abstract = {  The treatment of supersymmetry is known to cause difficulties in the
C*-algebraic framework of relativistic quantum field theory; several no-go
theorems indicate that super-derivations and super-KMS functionals must be
quite singular objects in a C*-algebraic setting. In order to clarify the
situation, a simple supersymmetric chiral field theory of a free Fermi and Bose
field defined on $\R$ is analyzed. It is shown that a meaningful C*-version of
this model can be based on the tensor product of a CAR-algebra and a novel
version of a CCR-algebra, the "resolvent algebra". The elements of this
resolvent algebra serve as mollifiers for the super-derivation. Within this
model, unbounded (yet locally bounded) graded KMS-functionals are constructed
and proven to be supersymmetric. From these KMS-functionals, Chern characters
are obtained by generalizing formulae of Kastler and of Jaffe, Lesniewski and
Osterwalder. The characters are used to define cyclic cocycles in the sense of
Connes' noncommutative geometry which are "locally entire".

Conversely any quasi-free state is the equilibrium state for a single one-particle evolution if it has no Fock part in its product decomposition. Limiting cases where → 0 and → ∞ are studied. In the case where → 0 one shows that the state generally converges to a Fock state linked to the evolution.},
