	abstract = {Research on videogames has largely focused on their negative effects on aggressive attitudes and behaviours (e.g., Anderson \& Bushman, 2001; Anderson et al., 2004). However, the motivations and experiences associated with this activity have received little theoretical and empirical attention. These aspects of gaming were examined in a sample of regular gamers using a mixed-methods approach. An online questionnaire was completed by a sample of gamers (N=310). This included an open-response section which asked participants to provide an account of their intrinsic and extrinsic gaming motivations, and associated experiences. Analyses of the qualitative data revealed that the main motivations for gaming were the need for socialisation, challenge, accomplishment, fantasy, stress-relief, alleviation of boredom, escapism and exploration. Enjoyment and flow were also important experiential factors, consistent with previous research findings. The analysis of the quantitative data suggested the influence of achievement and immersion-orientated motivations on flow experiences. The qualitative aspect of the study also provided a more detailed exploration of the motivations for videogame use, and offers some indication of the relationship between gaming motivations and enjoyment. Future research should further utilise qualitative methodologies to provide a more detailed examination of gaming experiences and associated outcomes. },

As I explain, Minecraft{\textquoteright}s surprise success as an {\textquotedblleft}indie{\textquotedblright} game is largely attributable to the ways in which it draws upon amateur creativity. I conclude the chapter by suggesting that more games like Minecraft may be socially desirable, but noting that current intellectual property laws discourage the creation of these sorts of games. },

	abstract = {The increasingly social nature of gaming suggests the importance of understanding its affective and psychological outcomes. The current research examined the influence of social motivations and gaming contexts on dimensions of psychological well-being. It also aimed to examine the influence of social factors on gaming experiences. The programme of research consisted of two separate studies using different methodologies in which a total of 327 videogamers participated.  The results revealed that social motivations predicted flow in gaming, and that some social motivations and social contexts were predictive of dimensions of psychological well-being. Qualitative analysis revealed the importance of social connectedness and belonging for game enjoyment, and suggested these are key factors which keep gamers playing. Social interactions and networking during gameplay also had an important influence on game enjoyment. Social experiences could also facilitate feelings of frustration in gameplay due to poor social dynamics and competitiveness with other players. These findings demonstrate the importance of social experiences and their influences on the outcomes of gaming. Future research is needed to examine the role of competitiveness in the dynamics of online and offline social gaming contexts, as well as gaming experiences and outcomes. Research examining the differences between gaming experiences for both solo and multiplayer gaming is also warranted. },

	abstract = {Videogames are extremely complex forms of media which consist of numerous constituent
parts, including a wide range of different game aspects (e.g., storyline, multi-player options), and
player experiences (e.g., immersion, flow). Previous experimental studies in psychology, examining the
differential effects of violent versus non-violent videogames have been methodologically limited when
choosing suitable videogames between experimental conditions. This paper outlines a methodological
approach for identifying potential differences between videogames. This can be obtained by using
regular gamers to rate videogames on numerous game aspects and player experiences. This method
can effectively initialise the research process when selecting games, to ensure control of games
between experimental conditions. This paper acknowledges the complexity of games, and aims to
inform future research of the effectiveness of this method within the pilot testing stage of the research
process.},

When examined from the theoretical perspectives of Goffman{\textquoteright}s Self-Presentation theory, Huizenga{\textquoteright}s Magic Circle, and Turkle{\textquoteright}s early work on online identity formation, these players were seen as largely using virtual spaces as creative outlets and for socialization.

This change is occurring at a time when the line separating game and physical worlds is becoming less distinct. The new business model entails a subtle but significant reduction in consumer rights awareness, which explains why some members of the greater gaming community are negotiating a new sense of fairness and arriving at a new consensus regarding legitimate gameplay.},

The present work formulates a preliminary typology of natural mapping and addresses how several types of mapping impact the experience of a video game, with the expectation that more natural mapping leads to increased spatial presence affecting enjoyment. Two studies were conducted. In the first study, 48 participants played a golfing video game using one of two controller types (Nintendo Wiimote or gamepad). In the second, 78 participants played a driving video game using an even more natural controller (steering wheel) or one of three other controller types. Participants then completed measures of perceived naturalness, presence, and enjoyment. Results of both studies were generally consistent with expectations. },

Results indicated that student experiences in the game mode showed increased alertness, increased feelings of being active, increased feelings of involvement and an increased perception of challenge. Flow characteristics revealed boredom during standard lectures but anxiety and flow during game modes. Finally, some evidence of improved attainment was evident.

Today, youth not only consume media when browsing the Internet and sharing information on social networking sites, but they also produce content when contributing to blogs, designing animations, graphics, and video productions  (  Ito et al., 2009).   This new media landscape suggests an extension of what critical participation means in new media literacy, extending the metaphor of {\textquotedblleft}reading the world to read the word{\textquotedblright}  (  Freire \& Macedo, 1987)   to include writing new media texts in a digital era. In an effort to map out the participatory competencies needed in this new media landscape,  Jenkins, Clinton, Purushotma, Robinson, and Weigel (2006)  included creative designs, ethical considerations, and technical skills to capture youths{\textquoteright} expressive and intellectual engagement with new media. More recently, these efforts to produce your own media have also been associated with the growing do-it-yourself, or DIY, movement  (  Guzzetti, Elliott, \& Welsch, 2010;  Lankshear \& Knobel, 2010),   involving arts, crafts, and new technologies  (  Eisenberg \& Buechley, 2008;  Spencer, 2005).

	abstract = {Background. Many patients have difficulty interpreting risks described in statistical terms as percentages. Computer game technology offers the opportunity to experience how often an event occurs, rather than simply read about its frequency. Objective. To assess effects of interactive graphics on risk perceptions and decisions. Design. Electronic questionnaire. Participants and setting. Respondents (n = 165) recruited online or at an urban hospital. Intervention. Health risks were illustrated by either static graphics or interactive game-like graphics. The interactive search graphic was a grid of squares, which, when clicked, revealed stick figures underneath. Respondents had to click until they found a figure affected by the disease. Measurements. Risk feelings, risk estimates, intention to take preventive action. Results. Different graphics did not affect mean risk estimates, risk feelings, or intention. Low-numeracy participants reported significantly higher risk feelings than high-numeracy ones except with the interactive search graphic. Unexpectedly, respondents reported stronger intentions to take preventive action when the intention question followed questions about efficacy and disease severity than when it followed perceived risk questions (65\% v. 34\%; P < 0.001). When respondents reported risk feelings immediately after using the search graphic, the interaction affected perceived risk (the longer the search to find affected stick figures, the higher the risk feeling: {\oe}{\r A} = 0.57; P = 0.009). Limitations. The authors used hypothetical decisions. Conclusions. A game-like graphic that allowed consumers to search for stick figures affected by disease had no main effect on risk perception but reduced differences based on numeracy. In one condition, the game-like graphic increased concern about rare risks. Intentions for preventive action were stronger with a question order that focused first on efficacy and disease severity than with one that focused first on perceived risk.},

Different games have different consequences, and it is important to understand the varying consequential contexts that games afford. Whether or not the consequences may be measured economically, it is nevertheless important to consider how social interactions may complicate forms of self-expression in ways that impact the human spirit.},

The BMCVGs were rated more enjoyable than traditional cycling exercise and the Flow dimensions Challenge-Skill Balance and Merging of Action and Awareness scored significantly higher than the norms for exercise activity and instead corresponded more closely to the norms for sporting activity. These findings suggest that BMCVGs could therefore act as a gateway for sedentary individuals to become involved in sporting activities.},

Buying a patient simulator, finding a volunteer to act as the patient, or even obtaining ready-made scenarios from another simulation center are rarely insurmountable challenges. The issue often lies in how to use or adapt these for your own purpose: with your team, facilities, and resources but primarily for your learners. Published information is limited in the area of scenario preparation for health care education and continuing medical education or continuing professional development. This article is a guide for clinical tutors, standardized patient trainers, and patient simulator operators on how to script scenarios and proposes a new detailed and reusable template for writing scenarios. It contains practical sections such as how to decide on the learning objectives to be addressed, how to script and organize your scenarios, and how to pitch the suitable level of details to make the scenarios appropriately realistic.},

A growing body of research focuses specifically on the study of cognitive-affective dynamics, defined as the natural ways in which a student{\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\^o}s cognitive-affective states change over time. These types of studies help designers identify desirable (virtuous) cycles that they want to foster and undesirable (vicious) cycles that they want to dissuade. In this study, the author examined the dynamics of the cognitive-affective states exhibited by Filipino students as they used the pre-algebra game MATH BLASTER 9-12. The author focused on the cognitive-affective states of boredom, confusion, delight, engagement, frustration, neutrality, and surprise. Using quantitative field observations, the author determined which of these states tended to persist or transition into other states over time. It was found that boredom was the only state that tended to persist. Boredom tended not to lead to engagement. Students who were confused were not likely to stay confused but were likely to transition into engagement. Students who were delighted were not likely to become confused. From these findings and based on comparisons with related work, it is concluded that boredom is a persistent and undesirable state. Confusion is not persistent and is desirable because it leads to further engagement with the content.},

The results indicate that students have higher perceived transfer of learning when they learn the simulation by reading the student manual and from peers rather than from the instructor or from hands-on experience.

A main objective is investigating adaptability under the simulated situation of rapid fuel price. The computer game survey approach has the potential to capture real behavior data through a well-controlled experiment, because the participant experiences the survey as a role-play exploration. Feedback from participants confirms that TACA SIM collects data efficiently in an acceptable time while the participants enjoyed the experience. The authors propose that this gamed-based survey approach provides the basis for collecting and evaluating travel behavior data and adaptation behavior.},

What makes the game analytically interesting is the creation of a game-world designed to promote a feeling of uncertainty in the player. This article explores the ways in which the ambience of uncertainty is developed within the game. Freud{\textquoteright}s writing on the uncanny and Kristeva{\textquoteright}s closely related work on abjection is drawn upon to explore how the game works rhetorically to place the player in an unsettled psychological state. The article argues that the use of the heavily gendered symbolism of the uncanny and the abject is value laden and that consequently we must pay attention to that which we cast out, reject, repress, and destroy in the fictive universe of video game play. The article concludes by suggesting that texts such as F.E.A.R. may resonate with wider uncertainties around the self in late-modern life. },

Gender performances are discussed within the framework of four themes: the avatar; strategies; sexuality, and the contextual importance of WoW. Results show that gender identity construction in WoW is an ongoing process highly dependent on the social context of play. The women interviewed created gendered and sexualized identities constrained and empowered by the rules of the game and the opportunities it offers as well as of their social relations. Although a heterosexual norm rules, there are possibilities hitherto unrecognized for queer performance within the gendered role play in WoW and the game offers the possibility of multiple and alternative performances of the self.},

Ego-Shooters are the home of so-called clans, which are one of the most popular and also most interesting types of game communities. With a qualitative approach the structural characteristics, communication processes and interpretational patterns of collective gaming from the perspective of a clan member were researched. The results clearly illustrate the interconnections between real world and virtual world processes of communication and interaction. Clans can be classified as something in-between a hobby and a semi-professionally played sport, whereas the latter better corresponds to the self-concept of most of the interviewees. It was repeatedly noticed that many clans still have a virtual pioneer status. This allows active and committed clan members the possibility for individual design not only of game play, but also of the social and communicative organisation of the clan.},

The Uncanny Valley phenomenon implies that virtual characters approaching full human-likeness will evoke a negative reaction from the viewer, due to aspects of the character{\textquoteright}s appearance and behavior differing from the human norm. This study investigates if {\textquotedblleft}uncanniness{\textquotedblright} is increased for a character with a perceived lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face. More important, our study also investigates if the magnitude of this increased uncanniness varies depending on which emotion is being communicated. Individual parameters for each facial muscle in a 3D model were controlled for the six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise in addition to a neutral expression. The results indicate that even fully and expertly animated characters are rated as more uncanny than humans and that, in virtual characters, a lack of facial expression in the upper parts of the face during speech exaggerates the uncanny by inhibiting effective communication of the perceived emotion, significantly so for fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise but not for anger and happiness. Based on our results, we consider the implications for virtual character design.},

Video games and digital worlds are promising new modes of association capable of connecting people in a way that passive forms of mass communication are unable to. This essay shows the strength of video games as a medium for associational life by turning to the thought of one of the preeminent philosophers of collective action: Alexis de Tocqueville. Although Tocqueville lived long before the advent of video games, his theory of democracy provides an excellent account of the benefits of civic associations. Among these are teaching enlightened self-interest, creating feelings of efficacy, protecting individuality, and establishing meritocratic norms. Video games are capable of providing each of these goods, making them an effective supplement, though not a replacement, to traditional associational life in an age of increasing fragmentation.},

The authors contend that post-apocalyptic digital games merit the same critical examination as their literary and cinematic counterparts, arguing that such games can provide a meaningful site in which questions about the future of technology play out against the dialectic of utopian and dystopian alternatives. Specifically, this article argues that the popular console game BioShock simultaneously celebrates and interrogates utopian notions of technological progress and free will embedded within prevailing industrial and academic conceptions of convergence. The authors explore the differing, yet complementary, conceptions of utopia put forth by critical theorists and the games industry in order to examine how BioShock{\textquoteright}s ambivalence toward technology{\textendash}-and technologies and practices of media consumption in particular{\textendash}-complicates more idealistic and totalizing forecasts for the future of media convergence. Building upon Alexander Galloway{\textquoteright}s treatment of gamic action as an {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}allegorithm{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} that permits procedural exploration and mastery of dominant control protocols in the information age, the authors analyze the way in which BioShock operationalizes the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}control{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} logic of convergence. By performing a close reading of the game{\textquoteright}s ideological content as well as its procedural strategies of transmediation, they link BioShock{\textquoteright}s ambivalence to the multifaceted, often conflicting nature of convergence discourse and practice within the digital games industry.},

	abstract = {Many designers, policy makers, teachers, and other practitioners are beginning to understand the usefulness of using digital games beyond entertainment. This has led to an increasing number of attempts to apply games meaningfully. Games have been developed from teaching students about history, making patients adhere in taking their medicine, to recruiting personnel for the military and collecting data to improve search engines. Yet, little is known on how to design such games. This book is one of the first to look into the fundamentals of designing any game with a serious purpose and provides a way of thinking on how to design one successfully.

Drawing on the personal design experience of the author as well as dozens of examples, the reader will be introduced to a design philosophy called {\textquotedblleft}Triadic Game Design.{\textquotedblright} This argues that all games involve three worlds: the worlds of Reality, Meaning, and Play. Each world is affiliated with different people, disciplines, aspects, and criteria. The philosophy also posits that a balance needs to be found within and between the three worlds. Such a balance is difficult to achieve, during the design many tensions will arise, forcing designers to make trade-offs. To deal with these tensions and to ensure that the right decisions are made to create a harmonic game, a frame of reference is needed. This is what Triadic Game Design offers. And this is what makes it an invaluable tool for practitioners and researchers who are interested in using and designing games that have a real world impact.},

Performance between the groups was compared (primary outcome). VR performance was correlated with conventional task performance (secondary outcome). Results: Lowest VR performance was found in children with low video game experience, followed by those with high video game experience, residents, and board-certified surgeons. VR performance correlated well with the spatial test and moderately with the fine motor test. Conclusions: The use of computer games can be considered not only as pure entertainment but may also contribute to the development of skills relevant for adequate performance in VR laparoscopic tasks.

Critical reception has been mixed, with some critics appreciating the images as critiques of real-world conventions of beauty, while others have found them bland and banal. The artists, however, have stated that the Portraits series is their most radical work to date. With such wide variance in critical reception and artistic {\textquoteleft}intention{\textquoteright}, it is worth asking a few questions: What is the significance of exhibiting portraits of Second Life avatars? What does it mean to re-present what is already a representation {\textemdash} and what is in fact being represented? And, given that the Portraits are predominantly close-ups of faces, and also that they are brought to us via a whole series of digital interfaces, what role do the face and the interface play in the production and understanding of these images?},

Despite their significant contribution to the overall play experience, they are often neglected by the game research community. Conventional game theories such as ludology and narratology do not provide an insightful account of the sociocultural aspects of game play. Therefore, in this article, we report our observations and investigations into different forms of extrinsic play activities in an online virtual setting. Founded on activity theory, we articulate theoretical models that explicate game play in a sociocultural context. Our findings reveal that extrinsic play constitutes reflective play and expansive play, which transform the play activity and transport the players beyond the original boundary of play.},

A second reason for associating games with escapism relates to a common perception of play and games as opposite of seriousness and work and somehow set apart from the ordinary, everyday life. The paper discusses the nature of escapism and relates it to the above theoretical issues which contribute to a view of digital games as inherently escapist. The paper proposes a renewed view on digital games and escapism that takes into account their distinctive qualities and their role in everyday life.},

This article examines the techniques that these games use, including the shrewd marketing tools of the DS, the ways in which the games borrow from existing games genres, how they draw the player into a narrative web through a reconstruction of player agency, and the linkage with serial television. By specifically examining The Sims 2 Castaway (S2C, 2007), this article discusses how the changing of ludic objectives during these games influences player expectation and how this is increasingly reflected in other texts such as long-haul television series. These developments indicate not only an evolving canon within games but argue for their growing influence elsewhere in cultural production.},

Observing that appliances made for us to "enjoy labor," as one adversary in a recent Nintendo Wii title puts it, have a history, I show that hyperindustrial recreational appliances like the Wii design wonder for learning and play by deploying gestural-technical stylistics first prototyped in human-computer interaction design research. I apply ten stylistics of gestural interaction design to the Wii in order to articulate its differences from other interactive educational, recreational, and health devices. I conclude that the Wii increases bandwidth for player action with two distinct effects. First, it orients "wonder" as gestural-technical conduct, making an ethical claim to differentiate contemporary play and work, while, second, projecting an unprogrammed "signature effect" extended in a range of modifications by researchers and amateurs alike.},

Making these trade-offs takes place in a design space defined by three equally important components: (a) Play, (b) Meaning, and (c) Reality. The various tensions between these three components result in design dilemmas and trilemmas that make it difficult to balance a serious game.

Using a modified, commercial, adventure game with an appended Sequel database, this research reprises a well-known study of risk aversion within a virtual context. The results indicate that very similar overall measures of risk aversion can be obtained within an adventure game context. Furthermore, it shows that experimentation within this virtual environment permits outcomes to be recorded and analyzed regarding decision consistency, decision revisions, and psychological/behavioral variables that have not been available using either traditional lab or field research methods.

With the growing interest in player-generated content for online worlds such as Second Life, our discussion will address the role of avatars in identity play and self-representation as well as the social issues that arise within the game world.},

	abstract = {We examined the causal relationship between playing violent video games and increases in aggressiveness by using implicit measures of aggressiveness, which have become important for accurately predicting impulsive behavioral tendencies. Ninety-six adults were randomly assigned to play one of three versions of a computer game that differed only with regard to game content (violent, peaceful, or abstract game), or to work on a reading task. In the games the environmental context, mouse gestures, and physiological arousal-as indicated by heart rate and skin conductance-were kept constant. In the violent game soldiers had to be shot, in the peaceful game sunflowers had to be watered, and the abstract game simply required clicking colored triangles. Five minutes of play did not alter trait aggressiveness, yet an Implicit Association Test detected a change in implicit aggressive self-concept. Playing a violent game produced a significant increase in implicit aggressive self-concept relative to playing a peaceful game. The well-controlled study closes a gap in the research on the causality of the link between violence exposure in computer games and aggressiveness with specific regard to implicit measures. We discuss the significance of importing recent social-cognitive theory into aggression research and stress the need for further development of aggression-related implicit measures.},

Since then, cellular automata have been widely studied theoretically and evolved into multiple variants. In the 1970s, Bernard P. Zeigler proposed a formalism rooted on systems theory principles, named DEVS (discrete-event systems specifications), which paved the way for component-based modeling and simulation and related methodologies. The purpose of this article is to survey how cellular automata and its variant, called cell-DEVS, may be used to implement computer simulations that can be used as digital serious games. The authors illustrate that implementation through some of the practical applications of such cellular automata. They show various serious game applications using real case studies: first, a simple bouncing ball and pinball game, a particle collision model, another on gossip propagation, and an application on human behavior at a metro station.Then, they show an application to social simulation using a voters game, a theoretical application (a model called Daisy World, which is derived from Gaia theory), and applications to physical phenomena such as a sandpile formation model or, finally, a three-dimensional model of a {\textquotedblleft}virtual clay{\textquotedblright} that changes its shape when it is subject to pressure effects. },

The authors discuss four common temporal frames: real-world time (events taking place in the physical world), gameworld time (events within the represented gameworld, including events associated with gameplay actions), coordination time (events that coordinate the actions of players and agents), and fictive time (applying sociocultural labels to events, as well as narrated event sequences). They use frames to analyze the real-time/turn-based distinction, various temporal anomalies, and temporal manipulations as a form of gameplay. These discussions illustrate how temporal frames are useful for gaining a more nuanced understanding of temporal phenomena in games. Additionally, their relationist characterization of temporal frames supports analysis and design.},

The article posits that it is the confluence of systemic knowledge, practice, emotional involvement, and social embeddedness that creates the potential to achieve results that no other methods can match. A simulation game run constitutes a bout of individual and collective purposeful action by an individual or a group formed specifically for that purpose. People have evolved to be supremely good at just that. Simulation games can teach systemic knowledge, and they can enable participants to try out organizational changes. This potential is not always realized, however. Game runs are {\textquotedblleft}alive{\textquotedblright} and variable, and this is a risky strength. They activate not only the explicit rules but also the hidden cultural rules of the participants. This can lead to memorable learning as well as to frustration, particularly when games are used across cultures. The article specifies reasons why games could fail and offers ways to avoid these pitfalls. It shows that experience and craftsmanship are needed in game design, facilitation, and debriefing. },

Any study of the effectiveness and efficiency of eLearning, therefore, has to address a variety of issues, including the role of eLearning in knowledge and learning, its contribution to competent performance, its relationship to organizational transformation, and strategies for embedding it into other forms of electronic interaction. eLearning refers to a form of learning in which the instructor and student are physically separated by space or time, and the gap between the two is bridged through the use of online technologies. Virtual technology utilizes an interactive approach to computer-based learning by providing real-time feedback to the user. Surveys of manufacturing companies have verified their interest and enthusiasm in the potential of virtual technology for industrial applications; however, the companies noted that one of the barriers to investing in the technology is the need for a structured methodology to guide the application identification, as well as the model building and evaluation for this technology. The study referenced in this article addresses this need by providing a framework for the development of a virtual environment that provides information for manufacturing task completion. It builds upon extant research into the use of virtual reality for task completion as well as proposes a structure for virtual environment development.},

Thus, simulations that organize participants in teams for realistic manufacturing production problem solving are widespread as a way to use problem-based learning to teach lean manufacturing. But a critical assessment of existing simulations for lean manufacturing instruction has been lacking. Accordingly, a literature survey is conducted and existing simulations are classified according to their emphasis on lean tools or the overall lean system; the degree of their focus on soft skills, if any; and their area of application, whether academic or industry. Four gaps are found in existing simulation designs: lack of stress on soft skills, a mistaken focus on {\textquotedblleft}linear lean,{\textquotedblright} misunderstanding of the key role of the facilitator, and lack of realism.

The Advanced Energy and Material Systems Laboratory has designed, developed a prototype, and tested such a game platform survey tool, called Travel Activity Constraint Adaptation Simulation (TACA SIM). A main objective is investigating adaptability under the simulated situation of rapid fuel price. The computer game survey approach has the potential to capture real behavior data through a well-controlled experiment, because the participant experiences the survey as a role-play exploration. Feedback from participants confirms that TACA SIM collects data efficiently in an acceptable time while the participants enjoyed the experience. The authors propose that this gamed-based survey approach provides the basis for collecting and evaluating travel behavior data and adaptation behavior.},

	abstract = {The authors sought to develop and test a breath-controlled video game using a digital spirometer that, by providing visual breath biofeedback, could promote awareness of breathing techniques in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). To assess improvement in game performance during hospitalizations for CF exacerbations, the authors conducted a trial on 10 inpatients. Subjects had at least five 15-minute exposures to a breath biofeedback game that challenged them to track a moving target using their breath. Subjects reacted positively to the breath tracking challenge. Repeated-measures analysis of variance of a tracking fidelity statistic showed improvement in eye--breath coordination over 5 sessions ( P = .026). It was concluded that an electronic breath game is safe and can improve breath awareness among children with CF. This technology could also contribute to awareness of respiratory symptoms and foster social ties among CF patients.},

An area{\textquoteright}s attractiveness varies with the location changes of actors and the manipulation by planners. The game is based on a qualitative computer model with similar rules and elements. The role-play was effective in two ways: it sensitized participants to the interdependencies among actors and their contribution to a region{\textquoteright}s attractiveness and made the computer model more tangible to them. If a similar impact of the planning measures in the game can be expected in the real world, the effects of investments can provide strong incentives for the movers.},

This article addresses the problem of differences in gender preferences in gameplay, conflict resolution, response to stimulation, rewards, genre, content, environment and design features. These unresolved issues have created gaps in designing a more gender-inclusive game.
This paper argues a more gender-inclusive game is achievable by incorporating gender-inclusive components during the design process.The proposed framework defines gender-inclusivity in three key components: (1) genre, which indicates the type of game, (2) gameplay, which describes the game behaviour and (3) content, which describes the game content. Some applications of the framework are outlined.},

This article will analyze "Gaming 2.0" examples in order to identify tools that could help fulfill this need. Indeed, "Gaming 2.0" is a way for players to create videogame content without skills from the entertainment videogame industry. Can these tools be also used to create "Serious Games"?

To answer this question, we will first define a simple theoretical model of videogames. This model outlines four "game parts" that players can create through "Gaming 2.0"-related tools, and it will be used to provide a comparative analysis of fifteen "Gaming 2.0" examples. From this analysis, insights on the relevance of "Gaming 2.0" for the "Serious Games" field will be drawn.},

However, games usually differ on more variables than just the displayed violence, so the question whether the determined effects can be traced back to violent content only remains unanswered. One very obvious difference between first-person shooters and other digital games is the speed of gameplay.
We present an experiment in which participants play a modified version of a latest-generation first-person shooter in one of four conditions (A: high vs. normal speed, B: high vs. low violence). Physiological arousal is measured through conductive skin response, heart rate, force applied on mouse and keyboard, and body movement. Aggressive behavior measurements are taken through the Competitive Reaction Time Test.},

Furthermore because gaming is becoming increasingly social, it is important to understand the influence of social gaming experiences for affective and psychological outcomes. The current research examined the associations between social motivations and gaming experiences and aimed to explore the associations of these factors with the outcomes for mood and life satisfaction. The programme of research consisted of two studies of different methodologies in which videogamers (N = 327) took part.  Results showed that there were significant correlations between social motivations, social gaming contexts and the positive experiences derived through gaming. Also social motivations showed to be predictive of perceptions of life satisfaction. Qualitative analysis revealed the importance of social connectedness and belonging for game enjoyment and suggested these social factors to be key features which keep gamers playing. Social interactions and networking in gameplay were also influential to game enjoyment. Findings revealed, however, that social experiences could influence feelings of frustration in gameplay. This showed to arise from bad social dynamics and competitiveness against other players. The current research findings therefore show the importance of social experiences and their influences on the outcomes of gaming. Future research is needed to examine the role of competiveness on social dynamics in gaming and its influence on gaming effects. Furthermore, research examining the differences between gaming experiences for online and offline contexts, for both solo and multiplayer gaming is warranted. },

In the shaping of virtual worlds cybercash has been made a part of this, although the trade practices depends on the type of virtual world: extension worlds or detension worlds.

Both types of rationality play an important role in policy processes.

This article reports on our findings from a role-playing game designed to make students experience the difference between policy making as a process of rational design and policy making as a process of political negotiation. We conducted an experiment involving a large group of students enrolled in a first year, one-semester course, and a control group of students who enrolled in the same course 1 year later. The former were tested four times (start of the course, immediately before and after playing the game, and 3 months later) and the latter two times (at the start of the course and at the exam) for their understanding of how policy making{\textemdash}as-rational-design and policy making{\textemdash}as-political-negotiation differ on seven characteristics. Comparison of test results obtained before and after the role-play indicates a positive learning effect for some characteristics, and a negative learning effect for others.},

Participants explored the environment while searching for five targets during a limited time span, using either a 1PP or a 3PP. No significant overall effect was found for viewing perspective on the appraisal of the three-dimensional virtual environment on the dimensions of arousal and valence. However, a 3PP yields more perceived control over the avatar and the events, which is a requirement for engagement. Analysis of the performance on the search task shows that participants using a 3PP find more objects but also need more time to find them. The present results suggest that a 3PP conveys a more distinct impression of the environment, thereby increasing engagement, and probably induces a different viewing strategy. Hence, a 3PP appears preferable for simulation and training applications in which the correct assessment of the affective properties of an environment is essential.},

	abstract = {Gender-inclusivity in games has been a much debated issue and despite the dramatic growth of gender and games research, many challenges remain in designing a more gender-inclusive game. Gender-inclusivity in games may support certain features and in turn may even determine the features of applications built based on it. This poses a challenge: although we have good techniques for analyzing, designing and evaluating current games, our techniques for gender-inclusive games are much less formed. We present a brief outline of some unresolved issues concerning gender-inclusivity in games and the gaps in designing a more gender-inclusive game. There is little reported experience in the issues that arise in determining what features should go into a gender-inclusive game and for determining the success or failure in the evaluation of those features. The questions that arise from this situation are how to define gender-inclusivity in games, how to incorporate gender-inclusivity into a game creation process and how to accurately measure gender-inclusivity in games. We propose a framework that defines gender-inclusivity in three key themes: 
(1) gameplay, describing the game behaviour and how a player experiences the game. It include non-violent action (NVA), game support (GS), forgiving gameplay (FG), non-violent challenge (NVC), feedback system (FS), variety of activities (ACT), personalization (PER) and collaboration (COLL);
(2) content, describing the aesthetics elements of a game. It consists of character/avatar portrayal (AVP), game world graphics (GW), sound/music (SM) and storyline (STOR) and;
(3) genre, categorizes games into twelve broad genres: racing, simulation, classic/board, strategy, sports, shooting, role playing game, platform, children, puzzle/quiz, action and adventure. 
On-going research is being planned for experiments to validate the framework through expert reviews, game evaluations and game design projects. We believe the results may extend to other domains in technology enhanced teaching and learning applications to commercial games design.},

	abstract = {Gender-inclusivity in games has been a much debated issue and despite the dramatic growth of gender and games research, many challenges remain in designing a more gender-inclusive game. One of the challenges in designing a more gender-inclusive game is how to define gender-inclusivity in games. By gender-inclusivity in games, we refer to any component that characterizes a situation related to gameplay, content and genre of a game. A gender-inclusive game promises richer and balanced games for both male and female gamers but the current state of research in this field is still far removed from that potential. This is due to three gaps in game design: (1) the notion of gender-inclusivity in games is still ill-defined; (2) there is a lack of conceptual framework to support the design of a gender-inclusive game; and (3) lack of tools to support the development of a gender-inclusive game.

In this paper, we address these needs in turn through a generic framework, Gender-Inclusivity Framework (GIF). We first define gender-inclusivity in games, identify components of gender-inclusivity content and characterize gender-inclusivity in games behaviour. In conclusion, we outline how such a framework can be used to support the investigation of research in the area of gender-inclusivity in games.},

	abstract = {Research studying the effects of playing videogames has largely focused on their negative effects on aggressive attitudes and behaviour. The potential positive effects have received less theoretical and empirical attention. The current study used flow theory to permit a wider examination of the potential consequences of gaming for measures of affect and psychological well-being. It also aimed to examine the relationship between aggressive personality, gaming experience and mood effects. An experimental design was used, in which frequent gamers (N = 56) were recruited to play one of two videogames. Pre-test measures of trait aggression, psychological well-being and affect were taken. Following a forty minute gameplay period, post-test measures on affect and flow were completed. Findings of the pre and post-test affect measures showed that gaming facilitated positive mood and activation. Also, flow in gameplay showed to have positive associations with dimensions psychological well-being. Aggression showed no relationship with flow or with post-test positive or negative affect which suggests that gaming experiences are not significantly influenced by aggressive personality. The findings revealed minimal differences in measures of post-test affect or flow between the two game conditions. This suggests that violent game content is not the most crucial factor in determining the nature of the gaming experience and its impact on outcomes. Rather, it implies the process of gaming to be more important for gamers. Future research should aim to address this issue by considering gaming as a holistic experience rather than focusing too strongly on outcomes of exposure to violent content.

Inductive generalizations from several {\textquoteright}commercial{\textquoteright} games for good, including Civilization IV, Making History: The Calm \& the Storm, and RollerCoaster Tycoon describe patterns of learning among game players, showing how the design of in-game visualizations either led to success or failure to learn to use basic game controls. This analysis, inspired by ethnomethodology and grounded theory, sought patterns from gathered video data of student gameplay to highlight learning episodes and patterns of interface use. Patterns in affordance use (uptake of a perceived action potential) during collaborative gameplay reveal relationships among the video game interface and player behavior, giving focus to how an interface design can guide game player interaction. In line with Csikszentmihalyi{\textquoteright}s concept of flow, a proper balance of difficulty (between feelings of boredom, and too much difficulty) encouraged player engagement and learning. As evidenced in transcripts of collaborative gameplay, feelings of frustration with a game interface often led students to abandon in-game tasks, as did boredom with a given task. However, frustrated goal achievement often led to the re-negotiation of in-game strategies: an indication of engagement. Additionally, games that presented information using multiple channels encouraged learning, as did the use of specific visualizations such as the animation of in-game objects. Finally, a discussion of the affordances created by different game designs will offer educators and game designers guidelines to encourage motivated gameplay.},

This experimental study investigated to what degree, if at all, video game interactivity would help or hinder the noticing and recall of second language vocabulary. Eighty randomly-selected Japanese university undergraduates were paired based on similar English language and game proficiencies. One subject played an English-language music video game for 20 minutes while the paired subject watched the game simultaneously on another monitor. Following gameplay, a vocabulary recall test, a cognitive load measure, an experience questionnaire, and a two-week delayed vocabulary recall test were administered. Results were analyzed using paired samples t-tests and various analyses of variance. Both the players and the watchers of the video game recalled vocabulary from the game, but the players recalled significantly less vocabulary than the watchers. This seems to be a result of the extraneous cognitive load induced by the interactivity of the game; the players perceived the game and its language to be significantly more difficult than the watchers did. Players also reported difficulty simultaneously attending to gameplay and vocabulary. Both players and watchers forgot significant amounts of vocabulary over the course of the study. We relate these findings to theories and studies of vocabulary acquisition and video game-based language learning, and then suggest implications for language teaching and learning with interactive multimedia.},

	abstract = {Activity Theory supports the idea that human activity is hierarchically organized. Our research follows a qualitative case study that highlights the use of affordances, or potentials for action, during video game player interaction among peers and the game interface. Activity Theory{\textquoteright}s meditational triangle will shed light on motivated activity itself, the tools available to complete the activity, and peer relationships (such as role specialization and rules of interaction) to evaluate game designs and their ability to fulfill serious purposes with meaningful outcomes. This presentation will focus on Activity Theory and how the meditational triangle can be used to evaluate peer relationships within game play.

A blended approach incorporating features of Ethnomethodology and grounded theory will be used to construct an open-ended, bottom-up approach to studying collaborative game play. A true Ethnomethodological approach would reject the top-down, theory-driven approach required by Activity Theory, Activity Theory can highlight particular relationships during game player interactions to provide a frame for game player activity. Activity theory, when applied in conjunction with an emergent approach, can both broaden our concept of affordances and remind us to look for action potentials on the various levels of activity, and does not necessarily have to constrain findings by introducing preconceptions. While bound to the specific situation being studied and not seeking of patterns in observations, Ethnomethodology can be a very useful starting point for the analysis of game player activity in order to reveal underlying, and commonly overlooked, social assumptions.

Activity theory can be incorporated following an initially open-ended, emergent Ethnomethodological approach to highlight relationships and game player motivations that might have been initially overlooked. While this process becomes partially theory-driven in the end, it also allows us to obtain some of the benefits of initially using an open-ended ethnomethodologically inspired approach. This approach can help construct a context-dependent, bottom-up, indexical and descriptive representation of game player activity, which is crucial to understanding interactions within Serious Games and their associated meaningful outcomes.},

Techniques will be presented which uncover user practices and behaviors, aimed at uncovering a balance between aesthetics and functionality while maximizing interactive experiences. Research will be presented that outlines how to unpack gameplay experiences, so designers can design situations that yield intended, meaningful outcomes with lasting results.

The cutting-edge research approach described draws from a multi-disciplinary background to construct a very detailed picture of actual use, which informs the design process. Existing literature supports the idea that games can communicate complex ideas through exploration and play-testing, using constant feedback and assessment, by observing players{\textquoteright} behavior through interaction with other related objects in an environment. The design of specific visualizations, rules, and behaviors will be discussed, with impacts on human interaction and game play. By studying relationships among game interfaces and player behavior, patterns can be found that help to maximize motivation and flow, a feeling where one loses track of time and their surroundings (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).

In addition, research outlining the importance of role specialization and complimentary virtual identities in games like MMORPGs is presented, highlighting the importance of role-specialization, where group participation is required for success: such as guild formation, where characters of different ability work together towards mutual goals. Research methods addressing group activities and specialization (assuming roles) will be described, with effects on engagement: e.g., social ties to play games.

A blended method drawing from ethnomethodology (Garfinkel, 1967; Clayman \& Maynard, 1995) and grounded theory (Glaser \& Strauss, 1967; Charmaz, 2005) will describe how to go about finding patterns in gameplay, helping to design situations that yield intended, meaningful outcomes with lasting results. This open-ended approach allows observation of game players while they act in their natural environment, {\textquotedblleft}in-situ{\textquotedblright}, obtaining information that is highly relevant to the players themselves. Applying these results to game design can yield more effective, fun and playable games.},

The TBAG form of the Stroop task was administered to all participants twice, before playing and immediately after playing the game. Results: Participants with improved posttest scores, compared to their pretest scores, used the computer on average 0.67 {\textpm} 1.1 hr/day, while the average administered was measured at 1.6 {\textpm} 1.4 hr/day and 1.3 {\textpm} 0.9 hr/day computer use for participants with worse or unaltered scores, respectively. According to the regression model, male gender, younger ages, duration of daily computer use, and ADHD inattention type were found to be independent risk factors for worsened posttest scores.

	abstract = {It is widely agreed that the traditional process of schooling can benefit from the usage of computers as supportive tools. Of various approaches using computers in education over the last decade, e-learning and edutainment have become the most prominent. Recently, a number of authors have criticised these approaches arguing that they conserve traditional {\textquoteleft}drill and practice{\textquoteright} behaviouristic methods of teaching instead of enhancing and augmenting them. It has been proposed that a {\textquoteleft}paradigm shift{\textquoteright} is needed and that this shift may come through utilizing all the advantages of full-fledged video games, so-called digital game-based learning (DGBL). However, several case studies reported serious problems with the DGBL. Among the most notable issues are the lack of acceptance of games as an educational tool, problems with integration of games into formal schooling environments, and the so-called transfer problem, which is the problem of the inherent tension between game play and learning objectives, the tension that mitigates the ability of students to transfer knowledge gained in the video game to the real-world context. Here, we present a framework for an augmented learning environment (ALE), which verbalises one way of how these problems can be challenged. The ALE framework has been constructed based on our experience with the educational game, Europe 2045, which we developed and which has been implemented in a number of secondary schools in the Czech Republic during 2008. The key feature of this game is that it combines principles of on-line multi-player computer games with social, role-playing games. The evaluation which we present in this paper indicates the successful integration of the game and its acceptance by teachers and students. The ALE framework isolates key principles of the game contributing to this success, abstracts them into theoretical entities we call action-based spaces and causal and grounding links, and condenses them in a coherent methodological structure, which paves the way for further exploitation of the DGBL by educational game researchers and designers.},

Recent treatments of agency in games culture and game design have grown increasingly concerned with providing the player with limitless freedom to act. While this describes one form of pleasure, in narratively focused games it has the unfortunate consequence of pitting the agency of the player against the will of the designer. We contend that for narrative games it is valuable to refocus our definitions of agency on the notion of meaning, and propose a treatment of agency that emphasises communicative commitments. This form of agency draws on ideas from speech act theory, and relies on a degree of {\textquoteright}communicative competence{\textquoteright} on the part of both the game designer and player in order to function. We discuss mechanisms for training players in the necessary literacies needed to commit to meanings in games, and provide an example analysis of a game that successfully accomplishes this task. },

Following, a qualitative case study highlights the use of affordances, or potentials for action, during video game player interaction among peers and the game interface. Relationships among affordances and levels of activity are presented, which broaden the concept of affordances to include motivations. Additionally, activity theory will complement analysis by introducing the mediational triangle (Cole \& Engestr{\"o}m, 1993), providing a guide with which to analyze game player interactions and motives. The mediational triangle sheds light on the motivated activity itself, the tools available to complete the activity, and peer relationships (such as role specialization and rules of interaction) to evaluate game designs and their ability to fulfill serious purposes with meaningful outcomes.},

	organization = {Pantheon Books},
	abstract = {Tom Bissell is a prizewinning writer who published three widely acclaimed books before the age of thirty-four. He is also an obsessive gamer who has spent untold hours in front of his various video game consoles, playing titles such as Far Cry 2, Left 4 Dead, BioShock, and  Oblivion for, literally, days. If you are reading this flap copy, the same thing can probably be said of you, or of someone you know.

Until recently, Bissell was somewhat reluctant to admit to his passion for games. In this, he is not alone. Millions of adults spend hours every week playing video games, and the industry itself now reliably outearns Hollywood. But the wider culture seems to regard video games as, at best, well designed if mindless entertainment.

Extra Lives is an impassioned defense of this assailed and misunderstood art form. Bissell argues that we are in a golden age of gaming{\textemdash}but he also believes games could be even better. He offers a fascinating and often hilarious critique of the ways video games dazzle and, just as often, frustrate. Along the way, we get firsthand portraits of some of the best minds (Jonathan Blow, Clint Hocking, Cliff Bleszinski, Peter Molyneux) at work in video game design today, as well as a shattering and deeply moving final chapter that describes, in searing detail, Bissell{\textquoteright}s descent into the world of Grand Theft Auto IV, a game whose themes mirror his own increasingly self-destructive compulsions.

Blending memoir, criticism, and first-rate reportage, Extra Lives is like no other book on the subject ever published. Whether you love video games, loathe video games, or are merely curious about why they are becoming the dominant popular art form of our time, Extra Lives is required reading.},

Central to the argument is the idea that presenting the player as protagonist is not necessarily the most fruitful approach to narrative experiences in games, and that narrative coherence may be better established and maintained through letting non-player characters carry the weight of narrative progression. },

	abstract = {Selling virtual goods for real money is an increasingly popular revenue model for massively-multiplayer online games (MMOs), social networking sites (SNSs) and other online hangouts. In this paper, we argue that the marketing of virtual goods currently falls short of what it could be. Game developers have long created compelling game designs, but having to market virtual goods to players is a relatively new situation to them. Professional marketers, on the other hand, tend to overlook the internal design of games and hangouts and focus on marketing the services as a whole. To begin bridging the gap, we propose that the design patterns and game mechanics commonly used in games and online hangouts should be viewed as a set of marketing techniques designed to sell virtual goods. Based on a review of a number of MMOs, we describe some of the most common patterns and game mechanics and show how their effects can be explained in terms of analogous techniques from marketing science. The results provide a new perspective to game design with interesting implications to developers. Moreover, they also suggest a radically new perspective to marketers of ordinary goods and services: viewing marketing as a form of game design.},

But the origins of this rule are lost to history, and the reasons for it are not obvious. Second, it has never been adequately explained what makes something a "system{\textquoteright}" excluded from copyright protection under Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act. Modern courts interpret "system" as merely a synonym for "idea" or "process", two other categories of exclusions. Others have interpreted it using the broadest definition in the dictionary, which would sweep in large amounts of copyrightable material as well. Neither definition gives the term any meaningful content. Like solving a crossword puzzle, this Article uses each of these questions to shed light on the other. Games are uncopyrightable because they are systems. The case law that led to the adoption of Section 102(b) demonstrates that systems are schemes for transforming user inputs into a correlated set of outputs. Games do exactly that. A game is a scheme for transforming player activities into moves within the game. The reason why games and other systems are uncopyrightable then becomes clear: the purpose of a system is to serve as a forum for user activity; it is users, not authors, who provide the primary informational value to the outputs of a system. Games and other systems are excluded in order to fence in copyright protection before it reaches user creation.},

Understanding the nature of affective UX in interactive entertainment, especially with a focus on sonic stimuli, is an ongoing research challenge. In the empirical study reported here, participants played a fast-paced, immersive first-person shooter (FPS) game modification, in which sound (on/off) and music (on/off) were manipulated, while psychophysiological recordings of electrodermal activity (EDA) and facial muscle activity (EMG) were recorded in addition to a Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Results indicate no main or interaction effects of sound or music on EMG and EDA. However, a significant main effect of sound on all GEQ dimensions (immersion, tension, competence, flow, negative affect, positive affect, and challenge) was found. In addition, an interaction effect of sound and music on GEQ dimension tension and flow indicates an important relationship of sound and music for gameplay experience. Additionally, we report the results of a correlation between GEQ dimensions and EMG/EDA activity. We conclude subjective measures could advance our understanding of sonic UX in digital games, while affective tonic (i.e., long-term psychophysiological) measures of sonic UX in digital games did not yield statistically significant results. One approach for future affective psychophysiological measures of sonic UX could be experiments investigating phasic (i.e., event-related) psychophysiological measures of sonic gameplay elements in digital games. This could improve our general understanding of sonic UX beyond affective gaming evaluation.},

	abstract = {In a recent survey of over 319,223 students, 25,544 teachers, 19,726 parents and 3,263 school leaders in the United States, Project Tomorrow (2008) reports that more than half of students in grades 3 through 12 believe games would help them learn, and average 8-10 hours per week playing games. Only 3\% of elementary school students say they do not play games of any kind. While only 11\% of teachers reported that they already were using video games in class, many teachers feel that games could increase student engagement, address different learning styles, and teach critical thinking skills. Over half of the teachers surveyed were interested in learning more about integrating gaming technologies, with only 6\% of teachers saying that they saw no value in exploring games within education (Project Tomorrow, 2008, p. 4). These figured indicate a huge potential for Serious Games in educational contexts.

Games can create a rich user experience (UX) for game players while presenting opportunities to use meta-cognitive skills. Research suggests that video games can provide a rich experience while providing game players the ability to navigate a virtual world, in which complex decision making and the management of complex issues might resemble the cognitive processes that they would employ in the real world (Ducheneaut, Yee, Nickell, \& Moore, 2006; FAS, 2006; Squire, 2005; Stokes, 2005). Games are engaging, because they: {\textquotedblleft}give us enjoyment and pleasure; give us intense and passionate involvement; give us structure; give us motivation; give us doing; give us flow; give us learning; give us ego gratification; give us adrenaline; they spark our creativity; give us social groups; and give us emotion{\textquotedblright} (Prensky, 2001, p. 144).

Much of the existing research on Serious Games focuses on general introductions to gaming and their application in a classroom, broad case studies, and learning outcomes associated with using games in the classroom. There exists an opportunity for a thorough investigation into the actual uses of games in an educational setting, focusing on the collaborative learning process and how students make use of both cognitive and social affordances of gaming. Affordances can be used to focus on what opportunities are offered (afforded) to an actor by the environment (use of games in educational contexts) being studied. The term cognitive affordance is used to discuss a potential for cognitive action; and social affordance to describe a potential for social action. In this paper both the use of the video game interface and peer group cultures (Kirriemuir \& McFarlane, 2004) are foci of analysis. This descriptive analysis presented in this chapter can inform game design by improving game content and the game interface, as well as aiding in the design of content to achieve meaningful, serious outcomes. 

An open-ended, emergent approach drawing from ethnomethodology and grounded theory will be presented. The descriptive analysis to be described will enable game researchers to conduct qualitative, inductive case studies of game play, digging into actual uses of games in Serious contexts. An emphasis on conducting open-ended, inductive experiments is extremely useful for investigating new situations where a theory-driven approach (deductive hypothesis testing) may not be appropriate, as the method is open-ended and allows participants to describe what they feel is most relevant, rather than the researcher (and his hypotheses) predetermining what is most important.

Several influences are described, drawing from the fields of ethnomethodology, grounded theory, and usability research. While strict adherence to these fields of study is not followed, many features of these fields provide inspiration for investigating what occurs during collaborative gameplay. The hybrid method presented can assist researchers in discovering what is happening on a moment-by-moment basis as video games are played, and will guide researchers in finding patterns during game play to abstract patterns in gamer behavior. These inductively-generated hypotheses can be used to test highly relevant aspects such as a video game{\textquoteright}s usability or ability to create an engaging learning experience.

Following, influential theory will be presented that helps to form the basis for the later described hybrid, qualitative, inductive methodology. Samples of collected data will be presented, in the form of transcriptions of video recorded collaborative game play. The presented transcripts are from a study within an educational context, where analysis focused on learning; however, the method presented could be applicable to other {\textquoteright}serious{\textquoteright} contexts where meaningful outcomes are expected.},

Design/methodology/approach {\textendash} Basically, the paper depends upon a review of the literature associated with video game development. Past history is taken from texts and academic papers dealing with the subject. More current observations are taken from the business and popular press. These observations are placed within a context associated with the classic papers on industry evolution, paradigms, paradigm shifts, competition, and competitiveness. Findings {\textendash} It is difficult to capture present shifts in such a fast-growing industry, but these shifts seem clear: the original entry of video games into the arcade sector that led to the industry and the demise of pinball; the development of the home cartridge and console that made the industry a home-based phenomenon; the entry of independent game-publishers that made the industry a two-tiered one; and the development of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) that changed the way games are played. Originality/value {\textendash} The video game industry is an interesting one to follow. To an extent, its development characterizes our generation {\textendash} fast paced, technologically oriented, and targeted toward the young and young at heart. This paper takes the subject away from a historical or anecdotal approach and places it within the context of industry evolution, paradigms, and paradigm shifts. It thus should be of value to students of not only video games, but also the evolution of rapidly growing industries and establishment of competitive advantages. },

It has regularly been stated that its success is partly due to its attraction to a much wider audience than the proverbial male adolescent, yet academic research on its player base is lacking. This article reports on the first ever explorative survey (N = 760) conducted among players of The Sims2. Our study combined social role theory with gender and games theorizing to enable us to understand gender differences in play. We focused on gender differences in motivation for playing The Sims2, employing uses and gratifications as our guiding theory. Our results revealed that most of our participants were indeed female. The significantly higher score of male players on the challenge motive was anticipated by social role theory, but their higher score on social interaction was unexpected. Accordingly, we discuss the implications of our results for uses and gratifications theory as well as the necessity to investigate actual practices of play in more detail.},

	chapter = {73},
	abstract = {This essay examines the relationship between player and diegetic sound FX in immersive computer game environments and how this relationship leads, in large part, to the contextualization of the player within the virtual world of the game. This contextualization presupposes a primarily sonically-based perception of objects and events in the world and, in a multi-player game, this ultimately leads to communication between players through the medium of diegetic sound. The players{\textquoteright} engagement with, and immersion in, the game{\textquoteright}s acoustic environment is the result of a relationship with sound that is technologically mediated. The game engine, for example, produces a range of environmental or ambient sounds and almost every player action has a corresponding sound. A variety of relevant theories and disciplines are assessed for the methodological basis of the points raised, such as film sound theory and sonification, and, throughout, the First-Person Shooter sub-genre is used as an exemplar. Such games include the {\guillemotleft}Doom{\guillemotright} and {\guillemotleft}Quake{\guillemotright} series, the {\guillemotleft}Half-Life{\guillemotright} series and derivatives and later games such as {\guillemotleft}Left 4 Dead{\guillemotright}. The combination of the acoustic environment, the interactive placement of the player {\textendash} as embodied by his virtual, prosthetic arms {\textendash} in the environment and the sonic relationships between players produces the acoustic ecology. An exposition of this multi-player communication and the resultant acoustic ecology and player immersion, is the main objective of the essay.},

Trust was higher within closer social circles: trust was highest in teammates, followed other players across the game, followed by others online. Self-disclosure was positively related to trust of teammates and others in the game, while voice chat was only related to teammate trust.

{\textquotedblleft}Toward a Ludic Architecture{\textquotedblright} is a pioneering publication, architecturally framing play and games as human practices in and of space. Filling the gap in literature, Steffen P. Walz considers game design theory and practice alongside architectural theory and practice, asking: how are play and games architected? What kind of architecture do they produce and in what way does architecture program play and games? What kind of architecture could be produced by playing and gameplaying?

{\textquotedblleft}Toward a Ludic Architecture{\textquotedblright} is a must-read for analyzing and designing play and games from an architectural standpoint. Such a contribution is particularly applicable in an era when games extend into physical, designed space that is increasingly permeated by devices, sensors, and information networks, allowing for rules and fictions to superimpose our everyday environments. Including a maze-like, episodic, and critical discussion of interweaving {\textquotedblleft}play-grounds,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}Toward a Ludic Architecture{\textquotedblright} is a playful look at the conceptual space of play and games.},

In places like World of Warcraft, Second Life, and Free Realms, people are making friends, building communities, creating art, and making real money. Business is booming on the virtual frontier, as billions of dollars are paid in exchange for pixels on screens. But sometimes things go wrong. Virtual criminals defraud online communities in pursuit of real-world profits. People feel cheated when their avatars lose virtual property to wrongdoers. Increasingly, they turn to legal systems for solutions. But when your avatar has been robbed, what law is there to assist you?

In Virtual Justice, Greg Lastowka illustrates the real legal dilemmas posed by virtual worlds. Presenting the most recent lawsuits and controversies, he explains how governments are responding to the chaos on the cyberspace frontier. After an engaging overview of the history and business models of today{\textquoteright}s virtual worlds, he explores how laws of property, jurisdiction, crime, and copyright are being adapted to pave the path of virtual law.

Young children are spending increasing amounts of time online as technology continues to create significant changes in social and cultural practices in the 21st century. Some of children{\textquoteright}s online interactions can be categorized as playful in nature; however, play and technology are frequently positioned as oppositional. In this article, I explore the tensions surrounding the relationship between play and technology and relate it to similar discourses concerning the concepts of {\textquoteleft}real{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}virtual{\textquoteright}. I then move on to consider the growing popularity of virtual worlds with young children and examine the way in which the worlds have been marketed to children and parents/carers on the basis of their propensity to offer online play in a safe environment. The article provides an overview of two virtual worlds currently targeted at young children and draws on a survey of primary children{\textquoteright}s use of virtual worlds in order to identify the nature of play in these environments. One hundred and seventy-five children aged 5{\textemdash}11 completed an online survey and 15 took part in group interviews in which their use of virtual worlds was explored. This article focuses on the data relating to 17 children aged from five to seven years who used virtual worlds.

We review studies that investigate the ability of video games to modify processes in spatial cognition. We outline the initial stages of research into the underlying mechanisms of learning, and we also consider possible applications of this new knowledge. Several experiments have shown that playing action games induces changes in a number of sensory, perceptual, and attentional abilities that are important for many tasks in spatial cognition. These basic capacities include contrast sensitivity, spatial resolution, the attentional visual field, enumeration, multiple object tracking, and visuomotor coordination and speed. In addition to altering performance on basic tasks, playing action video games has a beneficial effect on more complex spatial tasks such as mental rotation, thus demonstrating that learning generalizes far beyond the training activities in the game. Far transfer of this sort is generally elusive in learning, and we discuss some early attempts to elucidate the brain functions that are responsible. Finally, we suggest that studying video games may contribute not only to an improved understanding of the mechanisms of learning but may also offer new approaches to teaching spatial skills.},

	abstract = {Video games have found their way into the clinical care of youth in most medical fields, and academic interest in their use is increasing steadily. The popularity of video games among youth may qualify them as a useful tool in psychotherapy for children and adolescents. Limited literature on use of video games in mental health care suggests that they can help young patients become more cooperative and enthusiastic about psychotherapy. Recent experience suggests that video games may facilitate therapeutic relationships, complement the psychological assessment of youth by evaluating cognitive skills, and elaborate and clarify conflicts during the therapy process. Concerns about video game content, perceived effects on youth, and lack of familiarity with this medium may form a barrier in their use in therapy offices. Further research on the benefits of video game use in psychotherapy, including patient characteristics that may moderate outcomes, is needed. Finally, future collaborations between clinicians and video game developers may produce specific games to be used in psychotherapy.},

Yet, like typical youth, many appear to enjoy playing videogames. This review considers the appeal of videogames to individuals with autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and specific language impairment. It examines how they respond to the various challenges that play entails with particular reference to sensory, cognitive, and social dimensions. It is argued that research into how these young people engage voluntarily with this dynamic and challenging medium offers great potential to extend our empirical and theoretical understanding of the disorders. Many gaps in our current knowledge are identified and several additional themes for possible future research are proposed.},

We set out from the hypothesis that videogames may become interesting resources for their inclusion in the education processes in formal contexts. Videogames become laboratories for social experimentation where the scenarios, conditions and situations affecting a given human phenomenon are reproduced. In this article, 35 videogames are analysed to find out which contents can be approached through them for the teaching of Social Sciences using problem-solving strategies. To this end, instruments for information gathering (data collection grid) and analysis (category system) were designed. The different contents of a social nature are analysed according to the study categories and in turn from the areas of social issues detected in them. We present a working proposal for the use of videogames in the classroom on the basis of resolution of relevant problems, determining which are the issues that we consider relevant, what questions the pupils can be asked to approach through videogames and what the characteristics, benefits and obstacles are in the use of these resources in the teaching of Social Sciences.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes that increasing technological sophistication in the creation of realism for human-like virtual characters is matched by increasing technological discernment on the part of the viewer. One of the goals for achieving a realism that is believable for virtual characters is to overcome the Uncanny Valley where perceived eeriness or familiarity are rated against perceived human-likeness. Empirical evidence shows the uncanny can be applied to virtual characters, yet implies a more complex picture than the shape of a deep valley with a sharp gradient as depicted in Mori"s original plot of the Uncanny Valley. Our results imply that: (1) perceived familiarity is dependent upon a wider range of variables other than appearance and behaviour; and (2) for realistic, human-like characters, the Uncanny Valley is better replaced with the notion of an Uncanny Wall because the Uncanny Valley, as a concept, is not fully supported by the empirical evidence but, more importantly as a standard for creating human-like realism, is an impossible traverse.},

	journal = {Audio Mostly},
	year = {2009},
	month = {September 2},
	address = {Glasgow},
	abstract = {The 1970 proposition that there is an Uncanny Valley which man-made characters inhabit as their human-likeness (both appearance and movement) increases has been a growing topic of debate in the fields of robotics, animation and computer games particularly since the turn of the century. However, what the theory and subsequent related writings do not account for is the role of sound in creating perceptions of uncanniness and fear, a particularly useful attribute in computer game genres such as survival horror. This paper has a dual purpose: to explore diverse writings on the uncanny as they relate to sound and to prepare the groundwork for future work investigating the possible relationship between sound and the Uncanny Valley.

The paper comprises, in large part, a survey of selected works on the uncanny and the Uncanny Valley from a variety of disciplines. It emphasizes the link between uncanniness and negative emotions, such as fear and apprehension, and discusses the genesis of the term uncanny in early psychoanalytical writings, relating this to more modern theories on human emotion. Writings on the uncanny, or related emotional states, from psychoacoustics, textiles research, films and computer games are assessed as to their validity and potential application to the fostering of an aural climate of fear in computer games and, where such writings do not explicitly deal with sound, attempts are made to apply the ideas contained within to sound as it exists within computer games. In dealing with the theory of the Uncanny Valley, the paper points out the theory{\textquoteright}s focus on appearance and movement to the exclusion of sound and suggests that there is an uncanny in sound that might, in future, be used to modify the Uncanny Valley theory. Throughout, there is the suggestion that the uncanny (and any future theory of an audio or audiovisual Uncanny Valley) can be harnassed to the design of horror computer games.

Ultimately, it is hoped, such work will be of use to computer game sound designers who wish to create a greater perception of fear and apprehension through the canny use of uncanny sound. Some of the design tips presented at the end of the discussion are already used instinctively by sound designers across a range of media, including computer games, whereas others are less obvious in their origin and affect. Recently published empirical data is provided to strengthen the case for the latter. In some cases, the design tips must await the coming of procedural audio to computer games.},

We tested this hypothesis by measuring IQ elements, computer gaming skills, general dexterity with chopsticks, and evaluating laparoscopic experience in correlation to performance ability with the da Vinci (R) robot.Methods Thirty-four individuals were tested for robotic dexterity, IQ elements, computer-gaming skills and general dexterity. Eighteen surgically inexperienced and 16 laparoscopically trained surgeons were included. Each individual performed three different tasks with the da Vinci surgical system and their times were recorded. An IQ test (elements: logical thinking, 3D imagination and technical understanding) was completed by each participant. Computer skills were tested with a simple computer game (hand-eye coordination) and general dexterity was evaluated by the ability to use chopsticks.Results We found no correlation between logical thinking, 3D imagination and robotic skills. Both computer gaming and general dexterity showed a slight but non-significant improvement in performance with the da Vinci robot (p > 0.05). A significant correlation between robotic skills, technical understanding and laparoscopic experience was observed (p < 0.05).Conclusions The data support the conclusion that there are no significant correlations between robotic performance and logical thinking, 3D understanding, computer gaming skills and general dexterity. A correlation between robotic skills and technical understanding may exist. Laparoscopic experience seems to be the strongest predictor of performance with the da Vinci surgical system. Generally, it appears difficult to determine non-surgical predictors for robotic surgery. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper offers an insight into the games software development process from a time perspective by drawing on an in-depth study in a games development organization. The wider market for computer games now exceeds the annual global revenues of cinema. We have, however, only a limited scholarly understanding of how games studios produce games. Games projects require particular attention because their context is unique. Drawing on a case study, the paper offers a theoretical conceptualization of the development process of creative software, such as games software. We found that the process, as constituted by the interactions of developers, oscillates between two modes of practice: routinized and improvised, which sediment and flux the working rhythms in the context. This paper argues that while we may predeterminately lay down the broad stages of creative software development, the activities that constitute each stage, and the transition criteria from one to the next, may be left to the actors in the moment, to the temporality of the situation as it emerges. If all development activities are predefined, as advocated in various process models, this may leave little room for opportunity and the creative fruits that flow from opportunity, such as enhanced features, aesthetics and learning.},

To date, few studies examine electronic game play in Thai adolescents. Our research describes the prevalence of electronic game play and examines associations between the time spent engaged in electronic game play and school performance of adolescents in Hat-Yai municipality. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,492 adolescents from four secondary schools and one commercial college from January through March 2007, using questionnaires for collecting information about demographic data, school grades, and electronic game play behaviors. The prevalence of electronic game play was 75\% in boys and 59\% in girls. Twenty-two percent of boys and 8.7\% of girls played electronic games every day with more than 2 hours per session. The two most common places of game play were at game shops (71\%), followed by at their own home (70\%). Using linear regression analysis, the "low user or less than 2 hours per session" game players and females were less likely to have school grades below 3.00 with adjusted odds ratios of 0.44 (95\% CI 0.25-0.80, p = 0.004) and 0.49 (95\% CI 0.30-0.76, p = 0.005) respectively.

It was hypothesized that adults who play video games, compared to nonplayers, would evidence poorer perceptions of their health, greater reliance on Internet-facilitated social support, more extensive media use, and higher BMI. It was further hypothesized that different patterns of linkages between video-game playing and health-risk factors would emerge by gender.Methods: A cross-sectional, Internet-based survey was conducted in 2006 with a sample of adults from the Seattle-Tacoma area (n=562), examining health risks; media use behaviors and perceptions, including those related to video-game playing; and demographics. Statistical analyses conducted in 2008 to compare video-game players and nonplayers included bivariate descriptive statistics, stepwise discriminant analysis, and ANOVA.Results: A total of 45.1\% of respondents reported playing video games. Female video-game players reported greater depression (M=1.57) and poorer health status (M=3.90) than female nonplayers (depression, M=1.13; health status, M=3.57). Male video-game players reported higher BMI (M=5.31) and more Internet use time (M=2.55) than male nonplayers (BMI, M=5.19; Internet use, M=2.36). The only determinant common to female and male video-game players was greater reliance on the Internet for social support.Conclusions: A number of determinants distinguished video-game players from nonplayers, and these factors differed substantially between men and women. The data illustrate the need for further research among adults to clarify how to use digital opportunities more effectively to promote health and prevent disease. (Am J Prev Med 2009;37(4):299-305)},

We then turn to assessing the effects of the Word War game on vocabulary retention in a controlled environment. To this end, we performed a user study using two variants of the Word War game: a speaking mode, in which the user issues spoken commands to manipulate the game cards, and a listening mode, in which the computer gives spoken directions that the students must follow by manipulating the cards manually with the mouse. These two modes of learning were compared against a more traditional computer assisted vocabulary learning system: an oil-line flash cards program. To assess long-term learning gains as a function of time-on-task, we had the students interact with each system twice over a period of three weeks. We found that all three systems were competitive in terms of the vocabulary words learned as measured by pre-tests and post-tests, with less than a 5\% difference among the systems{\textquoteright} average overall learning gains. We also conducted surveys, which indicated that the students enjoyed the speaking mode of Word War more than the other two systems.},

After completion of the game, the environment provides the student with a set of metrics that provides helpful clues as to how the student might reprogram the strategy to improve the result. The provided metrics help to avoid a tedious trial-and-error refinement process and, therefore, greatly motivate the student to complete the assignment and achieve a better result. The simulation environment can be used in either a standalone mode or in an interactive mode in which the students compete against one another online.

Furthermore, the newly emerged physically interactive electronic games can potentially enhance young people{\textquoteright}s physical fitness, motor skills and motivation for physical exercise. The empirical evidence to support the educational effectiveness of electronic games in HE and PE is still rather limited, but the findings present a positive picture overall. The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance to educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of HE and PE, and to electronic game designers. },

	abstract = {The overuse of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) is becoming a significant problem worldwide, especially among college students. Similar to Internet addiction, the pathological use of MMORPG is a kind of modern addiction that can affect students{\textquoteright} lives on both a physical and a psychological level. The purpose of this study is to understand MMORPG addiction from a user experience design approach. We first developed a complete model that includes eleven factors (challenge, fantasy, curiosity, control, reward, cooperation, competition, recognition, belonging, obligation and role-playing) to represent users{\textquoteright} experience in MMORPGs. After that, we design a questionnaire to measure student{\textquoteright} gaming experience and level of addiction. Students{\textquoteright} demography information, including gender and game playing habits, was also collected. Four hundred and eighteen Taiwanese college students aged 18-25 years old took part in this online survey. Regression analysis was then conducted to evaluate the relative explanatory power of each variable, with addiction score as the dependent variable and the eleven user experience factors as the independent variables. The results of regression analysis reveal five critical factors (curiosity, role-playing, belonging, obligation and reward) that can be used to predict MMORPG addiction. In addition, this study also infers possible casual mechanisms for increasing college students{\textquoteright} level of addiction. The implications of our findings for both design and educational practitioners were also discussed.},

We identify video-game play as a context in which flow is likely to occur, and where we can observe our neurophysiological conceptualization of flow using measurement techniques (functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) without disrupting the experiential state. After presenting preliminary evidence consistent with our synchronization theory of flow, we suggest ways to advance this research.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty may be an important component of the motivation provided by learning games, especially when associated with gaming rather than learning. Three studies are reported that explore the influence of gaming uncertainty on engagement with computer-based learning games. In the first study, children (10-11 years) played a simple maths quiz. Participants chose their preferred reward for a correct answer prior to seeing each question. They could either receive a single point or toss an animated coin to receive 2 points for heads or none for tails. A preference for the uncertain option was revealed and this increased during the quiz. The second study explored the discourse around learning when pairs of participants (13-14 years) competed against the computer in a science quiz. Progress depended on the acquisition of facts but also on the outcomes of throwing dice. Discourse was characterised by a close intermingling of learning and gaming talk without salient problematic constructions regarding fairness when losing points due to gaming uncertainty. A final experiment explored whether, in this type of game, the uncertainty provided by the gaming component could influence players{\textquoteright} affective response to the learning component. Electrodermal activity (EDA) of 16 adults was measured while they played the quiz with and without the element of chance provided by the dice. Results showed EDA when answering questions was increased by inclusion of gaming uncertainty. Findings are discussed in terms of the potential benefits of combining gaming uncertainty with learning and directions for further research in this area are outlined.},

	abstract = {Video games are enjoying fast-growing popularity, becoming a major component of young people{\textquoteright}s social lives and leisure activities. Many players share information and conduct social interactions in virtual communities (VC). The current study sought to examine the relationships between members and leaders in such video game communities using a number of variables to describe the member (i.e., knowledge sharing, usefulness, enjoyability, off-site interaction, satisfaction, loyalty, and intention to use) and the leader (i.e., leader involvement). Based on a sample of 2227 members and 41 leaders in 30 video game communities, the research demonstrated the use of a two-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine the relationships of VC leaders and members, appropriately adjusted for a nested structure. The results indicated that leaders who engage in higher levels of involvement in VC are more likely to have members who agree with and respond to the community. Furthermore, member- and leader-level factors were significantly associated with member satisfaction: knowledge sharing, usefulness, and enjoyability explained within-VC variance while leader involvement explained between-VC variance. Finally, member satisfaction demonstrated positive effects on both member loyalty and intention to use. The study further discussed the implications of these findings, offering direction for future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A Harris poll surveyed a randomly selected sample of 1,178 American youth ages 8 to 18. About 8\% of video-game players in this sample exhibited pathological patterns of play. Several indicators documented convergent and divergent validity of the results: Pathological gamers spent twice as much time playing as nonpathological gamers and received poorer grades in school; pathological gaming also showed comorbidity with attention problems. Pathological status significantly predicted poorer school performance even after controlling for sex, age, and weekly amount of video-game play. These results confirm that pathological gaming can be measured reliably, that the construct demonstrates validity, and that it is not simply isomorphic with a high amount of play.},

Current simulation-based design frameworks provide limited support for reuse of design processes at a level where design processes are networks of computational operations, specifically the capabilities to reuse (a) design processes for different products, and (b) collaborative design strategies. In this article, we address these limitations by providing a modeling approach for simulation-based design processes so that they can be archived in a generic modular fashion and reused for collaborative design of different products. The proposed approach is based on four foundations: (a) modeling design processes as hierarchical systems, (b) separation of declarative and procedural information, (c) modeling design processes as decision-centric activities, and (d) modeling interactions between decision makers using game theoretic protocols. These four fundamentals of the approach are instantiated in the form of generic computational templates for products, processes, decisions, and pertinent interfaces. The approach is illustrated using a proof of concept implementation in ModelCenter. The implementation is validated by showing the reusability of design processes for two different products, a spring and a pressure vessel, in individual and collaborative design scenarios. The approach has potential for supporting reusability of broader PLM processes.},

Given the increase in screen media targeted at the very young, the purpose of this study was to examine preschooler parents{\textquoteright} knowledge about expert recommendations for young children{\textquoteright}s screen media experience, their knowledge of specific screen media ratings, their beliefs about screen media effects, and actual monitoring practices.METHOD. Parents of 94 children < 5 years of age (mean age: 2.95 years) were surveyed. Questionnaires were distributed in day care centers and completed at the parents{\textquoteright} convenience. The questionnaire included background questions about parental education, age and gender of child, and parents{\textquoteright} perceptions of their child{\textquoteright}s favorite television show and favorite video or computer game. Eleven multiple-choice questions assessed the respondent{\textquoteright}s knowledge of expert recommendations for screen media for preschoolers and the meaning of television and video game content ratings. Fourteen questions addressed the typical amount of their preschooler{\textquoteright}s screen media exposure, parental rules regarding screen media use, and parents{\textquoteright} beliefs about appropriate use of screen media for preschoolers.RESULTS. Preschoolers were exposed to an average of similar to 12 hours of screen media in a typical week. Parents believe that media do have either short- or long-term effects on preschoolers. Performance on factual questions was poor (mean score: 2.83 of 11). In particular, only 34\% of the parents correctly identified the expert recommendation for children > 2 years of age.CONCLUSIONS. Parents should continue to be educated about the need for preschoolers to participate in activities that promote language development, socialization, imagination, and physical activity. Although professionals should work to improve the ratings, and ultimately to implement a universal ratings system for all screen media, parents need to be encouraged to improve their understanding of current recommendations for screen media exposure and television and video game ratings.

	abstract = {Activity of the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) displays a mixture of sensory, motor, and memory signals. Moreover, they often encode signals reflecting the accumulation of sensory evidence that certain eye movements might lead to a desirable outcome. However, when the environment changes dynamically, animals are also required to combine the information about its previously chosen actions and their outcomes appropriately to update continually the desirabilities of alternative actions. Here, we investigated whether LIP neurons encoded signals necessary to update an animal{\textquoteright}s decision-making strategies adaptively during a computer-simulated matching-pennies game. Using a reinforcement learning algorithm, we estimated the value functions that best predicted the animal{\textquoteright}s choices on a trial-by-trial basis. We found that, immediately before the animal revealed its choice, similar to 18\% of LIP neurons changed their activity according to the difference in the value functions for the two targets. In addition, a somewhat higher fraction of LIP neurons displayed signals related to the sum of the value functions, which might correspond to the state value function or an average rate of reward used as a reference point. Similar to the neurons in the prefrontal cortex, many LIP neurons also encoded the signals related to the animal{\textquoteright}s previous choices. Thus, the posterior parietal cortex might be a part of the network that provides the substrate for forming appropriate associations between actions and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Many children are reported to have insufficient physical activity (PA) placing them at greater risk of poor health outcomes. Participating in sedentary activities such as playing electronic games is widely believed to contribute to less PA. However there is no experimental evidence that playing electronic games reduces PA. There is also no evidence regarding the effect of different types of electronic games (traditional sedentary electronic games versus new active input electronic games) on PA. Further, there is a poor understanding about how characteristics of children may moderate the impact of electronic game access on PA and about what leisure activities are displaced when children play electronic games. Given that many children play electronic games, a better understanding of the effect of electronic game use on PA is critical to inform child health policy and intervention.Methods: This randomised and controlled trial will examine whether PA is decreased by access to electronic games and whether any effect is dependent on the type of game input or the child{\textquoteright}s characteristics. Children aged 10-12 years (N = 72, 36 females) will be recruited and randomised to a balanced ordering of {\textquoteright}no electronic games{\textquoteright}, {\textquoteright} traditional{\textquoteright} electronic games and {\textquoteright}active{\textquoteright} electronic games. Each child will participate in each condition for 8 weeks, and be assessed prior to participation and at the end of each condition. The primary outcome is PA, assessed by Actical accelerometers worn for 7 days on the wrist and hip. Energy expenditure will be assessed by the doubly labelled water technique and motor coordination, adiposity, self-confidence, attitudes to technology and PA and leisure activities will also be assessed. A sample of 72 will provide a power of > 0.9 for detecting a 15 mins difference in PA (sd = 30 mins).Discussion: This is the first such trial and will provide critical information to understand whether access to electronic games affects children{\textquoteright}s PA. Given the vital importance of adequate PA to a healthy start to life and establishing patterns which may track into adulthood, this project can inform interventions which could have a profound impact on the long term health of children.Trial registration: This trial is registered in the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN 12609000279224).},

	abstract = {The GMABS (Games and Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) methodology was created from the integration of RPG and MABS techniques. This methodology links the dynamic capacity of MABS (Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) and the discussion and learning capacity of RPG (Role-Playing Games). Using GMABS, we have developed two prototypes in the natural resources management domain. The first prototype, called JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2005), is a paper-based game: all players need to be physically present in the same place and time, and there is a minimum needed number of participants to play the game. In order to avoid this constraint, we have built a second prototype, called ViP-JogoMan (Adamatti et. al, 2007), which is an extension of the first one. This second game enables the insertion of virtual players that can substitute some real players in the game. These virtual players can partially mime real behaviors and capture autonomy, social abilities, reaction and adaptation of the real players. We have chosen the BDI architecture to model these virtual players, since its paradigm is based on folk psychology; hence, its core concepts easily map the language that people use to describe their reasoning and actions in everyday life. ViP-JogoMan is a computer-based game, in which people play via Web, players can be in different places and it does not have a hard constraint regarding the minimum number of real players. Our aim in this paper is to present some test results obtained with both prototypes, as well as to present a preliminary discussion on how the insertion of virtual players has affected the game results.},

The objective is to infer a hidden variable or treasure by selecting a sequence of measurements associated with multiple fixed targets distributed in the sensor workspace. The workspace is represented by a connectivity graph, where each node represents a possible sensor deployment, and the arcs represent possible sensor movements. An additive conditional entropy reduction function is presented to efficiently compute the expected benefit of a measurement sequence over time. Then, the optimal treasure hunt strategy is determined by a novel label-correcting algorithm operating on the connectivity graph. The methodology is illustrated through the board game of CLUE (R), which is shown to be a benchmark example of the treasure hunt problem. The game results show that a computer player implementing the strategies developed in this paper outperforms players implementing Bayesian networks, Q-learning, or constraint satisfaction, as well as human players.},

	abstract = {Video games are virtual worlds, each with its own, distinctive spatiality. This paper suggests that there are two interrelated conceptual dimensions to the study of video games. First, there are the representational issues concerning the worlds depicted in video games, such as those portraying hypersexualized women or Orientalist depictions of Arab enemies. We suggest, however, that these cultural, sexual, and political representations are not the only forces doing work on the player within the virtual world of a video game. This paper complements a purely representational approach by considering {\textquoteright}affect{\textquoteright} as a precognitive force which disrupts and delights the player with reactions ranging from fear to joy. We argue that, as the spatiality of video games has evolved from simple two-dimensional to complex three-dimensional worlds; the importance of an affective experience to the player has become paramount. Exploiting and manipulating the player{\textquoteright}s sensory experience is now the central strategy for many game designers. The paper is divided in two interrelated sections: the first tackles representational issues from culture to violence, while the second section contributes to our understanding of video games as {\textquoteright}worlds of affect{\textquoteright}.},

A questionnaire was used to assess a nationwide postal sample of 12-18-year-old Finns (6761 respondents, response rate 69\%) in winter 2003. Among respondents, 4085 adolescents played digital games and answered questions on digital game motives. Two main motives emerged: instrumental (learn new things and procedures, have a common topic for conversation, use and develop game playing skills, experience different roles/worlds) and ritualized (pastime, entertainment; recover, relax; escape everyday life, forget worries). The importance of all motives increased for participants with longer playing times. Instrumental motives were more important to boys and younger respondents. They were associated with earlier bedtime, worse perceived health, better mother communication, and better school grades, but only among boys. The importance of ritualized motives increased with age and was related to better school performance, worse sleeping habits, and worse perceived health in both sexes. Digital games seem to have the same basic functions as media in serving adolescents{\textquoteright} mood management and stimulation seeking. Among boys, gaming is part of the male socio-cultural communication context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Children were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 conditions: (1) the healthier advergame condition, (2) the less healthy advergame condition, or (3) the control condition.Setting: Urban public elementary schools.Participants: Thirty low-income, African American children aged 9 to 10 years.Main Exposure: Children in the treatment conditions played a less healthy or a healthier version of an advergame 2 times before choosing and eating a snack and completing the experimental measures. Children in the control group chose and ate a snack before playing the game and completing the measures.Main Outcome Measures: The number of healthier snack items children selected and ate and how much children liked the game.Results: Children who played the healthier version of the advergame selected and ate significantly more healthy snacks than did those who played the less healthy version. Children reported liking the advergame.Conclusions: Findings suggest that concerns about online advergames that market unhealthy foods are justified. However, advergames may also be used to promote healthier foods and beverages. This kind of social marketing approach could tip the scales toward the selection of higher-quality snacks, thereby helping to curb the obesity epidemic.},

However, there is uncertainty concerning the extent to which such properties might be carried across contexts. In the current study we sought to determine whether conditioning-dependent motivational properties can transfer from a computer game to the real world and, further, whether this conditioning might be expressed in terms of brain responses measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We studied healthy participants conditioned with aversive and appetitive drinks in the context of a virtual cycling race. Three days after conditioning, participants returned for a fMRI session. We took this opportunity to observe the impact of incidental presentation of conditioned stimuli on a real-world decision (seat choice). We found a significant influence of conditioning on seat choice and, moreover, noted that individual susceptibility to this influence was reflected in differential insula cortex responses during subsequent scanning. The choice was also predicted by participants{\textquoteright} personality scores and, as a statistical trend (p = 0.07), by their sense of immersion in the game environment. Our data show that motivational properties of stimuli can transfer from the virtual to the real world. While much concern has been expressed over the impact of virtual experience on general levels of aggression and mood, our data point to another important consideration: the fact that a stimulus in the virtual environment can acquire motivational properties that persist and modify behavior in the real world.},

We critically appraised all studies.A total of 12 studies: three experiments with children with behavioural and emotional difficulties found increased aggression after watching aggressive as opposed to low-aggressive content television programmes, one found the opposite and two no clear effect, one found such children no more likely than controls to imitate aggressive television characters. One case-control study and one survey found that children and young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties watched more television than controls; another did not. Two studies found that children and young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties viewed more hours of aggressive television programmes than controls. One study on video game use found that young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties viewed more minutes of violence and played longer than controls. In a qualitative study children with behavioural and emotional difficulties, but not their parents, did not associate watching television with aggression. All studies had significant methodological flaws. None was based on power calculations.This systematic review found insufficient, contradictory and methodologically flawed evidence on the association between television viewing and video game playing and aggression in children and young people with behavioural and emotional difficulties.

	abstract = {Present computer games and digital entertainment do not usually facilitate intergenerational family interactions. According to recent survey results in Japan, there is a high percentage of older people who own and play electronic or computer games, but rarely do they play the games with their family members. it is a positive sign that more older people are participating in the digital games arena, but it would be even more beneficial if they Could interact actively with the young family members through gaming activities. This could possibly strengthen family bonding and bridge the gap between older people and youth culture.This paper presents steps for designing an intergenerational family entertainment system which focuses Oil physical and social interactions using a mixed reality floor system. The main design goals include: facilitating interactions between users with varied levels of skill in utilizing technology, utilizing the familiar physical motions from other activities to make an intuitive physical interface, and encouraging social interactions among families and friends. Detailed implementation of these steps is presented in the design of our intergenerational entertainment system, Age Invaders. Four main prototype iterations for the system is presented. Our design process is based on User Centered Design and relies on constant involvement of users to understand the key issues and to help make effective design decisions. The results of the study help to focus the refinements of the existing platform from a usability standpoint and also aids in the development of new physical entertainment and interactive applications. This study provides insights into user issues including how users interact in a complex mixed reality experience, which is heavily based in physicality. The use of one portion of the user base which is most proficient with technology before involving the novice users was found to empower novice users to begin to use digital technology.

The effects of the game environment on students{\textquoteright} achievement and motivation and related implementation issues were examined through both quantitative and qualitative methods. An analysis of pre and post achievement tests showed that students made significant learning gains by participating in the game-based learning environment. When comparing their motivations while learning in the game-based learning environment and in their traditional school environment, it was found that students demonstrated statistically significant higher intrinsic motivations and statistically significant lower extrinsic motivations learning in the game-based environment. In addition, they had decreased focus on getting grades and they were more independent while participating in the game-based activities. These positive effects on learning and motivation, and the positive attitudes of students and teachers suggest that computer games can be used as an ICT tool in formal learning environments to support students in effective geography learning.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate how playing a violent/nonviolent television game during the evening affects sympathetic and parasympathetic reactions during and after playing as well as sleep quality during the night after playing.Subjects and Methods: In total, 19 boys, 12-15 years of age, played television games on two occasions in their homes and participated once without gaming. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and physical activity were measured during gaming/participating and the night to follow using a portable combined heart rate and movement sensor. A sleep diary and questionnaires about gaming experiences and session-specific experiences were filled in.Criteria for Selection of Games: Violent game involves/rewards direct physical violence (no handguns) against another person, and nonviolent game involves/rewards no violence; same game design ({\textquoteright}third-person game{\textquoteright}); conducted in the same manner; no differences concerning motor activity; similar sound and light effects; no sexual content, violence against women or racial overtones.Results: During violent (vs. nonviolent) gaming, there was significantly higher activity of the very low frequency component of the HRV and total power. During the night after playing, very low frequency, low frequency and high frequency components were significantly higher during the violent (vs. nonviolent) condition, just as total power. There were no significant differences between the three conditions (violent/nonviolent/no gaming) with respect to an index reflecting subjectively perceived sleep difficulties. Nor was there any difference between violent and nonviolent condition for any single sleep item.Conclusion: Violent gaming induces different autonomic responses in boys compared to nonviolent gaming - during playing and during the following night - suggesting different emotional responses. Subjectively perceived sleep quality is not influenced after a single gaming experience. Future studies should address the development of the autonomic balance after gaming over longer time than a night, physiological adaptation to frequent gaming and potential gender differences.},

	abstract = {Autonomous synthetic characters have the potential to promote the social engagement of users in virtual environments, enhancing their interaction experience. In computer games, for example, poor interaction with game characters can drastically detract from the gaming experience, making the design of autonomous synthetic characters an important issue. In particular, in Role Playing Games (RPGs), for example, users and autonomous characters often perform in a group. Usually, the role of such characters is very limited since they lack the social skills to perform coherently in group scenarios.The goal of the work presented here is to endow autonomous synthetic characters with social skills that allow them to perform in groups with human members. However, to successfully achieve this, it is not enough to assure that the characters behave in a coherent manner from an individual perspective or that they are able to perform the group task optimally. It is also necessary that the autonomous characters exhibit behaviours that are coherent with the group{\textquoteright}s composition, context and structure.For this reason, we have developed a model to support group dynamics of autonomous synthetic characters (SGD model) inspired by theories developed in human social psychological sciences. This model defines the knowledge that each individual should build about the others and the group, and how this knowledge drives their interactions. The model was used in a collaborative computer game that was tested with users. The results showed that the model had a positive effect on the users{\textquoteright} social engagement, namely. on their trust and identification with the group. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports on a controlled experiment to compare the learning effectiveness of game play with traditional paper exercises, as well as with textbook reading. The results indicated that with equal time being spent on the various learning activities, the effect of game play was only equal to that of the other activities, not better. Yet this result is promising enough, as the increased motivation means that students work harder in the course. Also, the results indicate that the game has potential for improvement, in particular with respect to its feedback on the more complicated questions.},

Computer game content, like other popular media content, is regulated in different jurisdictions by one of three general models: the open market in which consumption decides the availability of product, industry self-regulation in which industry bodies decide, and government regulation in which government or quasi-governmental bodies decide. Arguably, these models represent the twentieth century state of the art and fail to keep pace with changes in the aesthetics and technologies associated with interactive entertainment. In a networked economy alternative models exist to serve content gatekeeping functions, and they serve to close the lags and limitations that plague existing models. These alternatives include innovations such as user-generated classification and dynamic meta-tagging.

	abstract = {This paper examines the concept of agency within games and proposes a shift from the notion of agency as representing choice or freedom to one of agency as representing commitment to meaning. This conception of agency is aimed at understanding the pleasures of engaging with narratively rich games, and helps to address the tension between player choice and authorial intent. We draw on what speech act theory says about how trust, meaning and communication are achieved in human conversation, applying these notions to interactive storytelling. This new perspective on agency provides us with a better analytical tool for understanding the relationship between interaction and narrative pleasure, and provides a useful metric for designers of story-rich games. },

	abstract = {Games technology has undergone tremendous development. In this article, the authors report the rapid advancement that has been observed in the way games software is being developed, as well as in the development of games content using game engines. One area that has gained special attention is modeling the game environment such as terrain and buildings. This article presents the continuous level of detail terrain modeling techniques that can help generate and render realistic terrain in real time. Deployment of characters in the environment is increasingly common. This requires strategies to map scalable behavior characteristics for characters as well. The authors present two important aspects of crowd simulation: the realism of the crowd behavior and the computational overhead involved. A good simulation of crowd behavior requires delicate balance between these aspects. The focus in this article is on human behavior representation for crowd simulation. To enhance the player experience, the authors present the concept of player adaptive entertainment computing, which provides a personalized experience for each individual when interacting with the game. The current state of game development involves using very small percentage (typically 4\% to 12\%) of CPU time for game artificial intelligence (AI). Future game AI requires developing computational strategies that have little involvement of CPU for online play, while using CPU{\textquoteright}s idle capacity when the game is not being played, thereby emphasizing the construction of complex game AI models offline. A framework of such nonconventional game AI models is introduced.},

In this article, we address the role of humor in computer games, especially in support of serious purposes. We begin with a review of the main theories of humor, including superiority, incongruity, and relief. These theories and their interrelationships do well in helping us understand the humor process, but they have been developed in the context of traditional human activity. To explore how they relate to computer games, we present the findings of a qualitative study of player experience of humor and show how it relates to the theoretical perspectives. We then review the main functions of humor, especially its effects on social, emotional, and cognitive behavior. We show how each of these functions can be used in game design to support the specific experiences and outcomes of game-play. Finally, we address the issue of serious games and make suggestions on how humor can inform and support the design of those games. We suggest that humor can support design by smoothing and sustaining the game mechanics. Moreover, games can draw on the functions of humor in the real world for enhancing communication, learning, and social presence. Using humor makes games richer and more powerful, as well as fun.},

In Experiment 2, individual participants using a Ku Klux Klan (KKK)-associated avatar created more aggressive Thematic Apperception Test stories in comparison to a control group. Participants using the KKK avatar also wrote less affiliative stories in comparison to those employing avatars dressed as doctors. Overall, the resulting pattern of activation of negative thoughts (i.e., aggression) coupled with the inhibition of inconsistent thoughts (i.e., cohesion, affiliation) is consistent with principles of current priming models and provides initial evidence for automatic cognitive priming in virtual settings.},

(Proceedings of the 45th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), pp. 295-304, 2004), where selfish players select paths in a network to minimize their cost, which is prescribed by Shapley cost shares. If all players are identical, the cost share incurred by a player for an edge in its path is the fixed cost of the edge divided by the number of players using it. In this special case, Anshelevich et al. (Proceedings of the 45th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), pp. 295-304, 2004) proved that pure-strategy Nash equilibria always exist and that the price of stability-the ratio between the cost of the best Nash equilibrium and that of an optimal solution-is I similar to(log k), where k is the number of players. Little was known about the existence of equilibria or the price of stability in the general weighted version of the game. Here, each player i has a weight w (i) a parts per thousand yen1, and its cost share of an edge in its path equals w (i) times the edge cost, divided by the total weight of the players using the edge.This paper presents the first general results on weighted Shapley network design games. First, we give a simple example with no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. This motivates considering the price of stability with respect to alpha-approximate Nash equilibria-outcomes from which no player can decrease its cost by more than an alpha multiplicative factor. Our first positive result is that O(log w (max) )-approximate Nash equilibria exist in all weighted Shapley network design games, where w (max) is the maximum player weight. More generally, we establish the following trade-off between the two objectives of good stability and low cost: for every alpha=Omega(log w (max) ), the price of stability with respect to O(alpha)-approximate Nash equilibria is O((log W)/alpha), where W is the sum of the players{\textquoteright} weights. In particular, there is always an O(log W)-approximate Nash equilibrium with cost within a constant factor of optimal.Finally, we show that this trade-off curve is nearly optimal: we construct a family of networks without o(log w (max) / log log w (max) )-approximate Nash equilibria, and show that for all alpha=Omega(log w (max) /log log w (max) ), achieving a price of stability of O(log W/alpha) requires relaxing equilibrium constraints by an Omega(alpha) factor.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare energy expenditure rates in children playing the physically active video games, Dance Dance Revolution ( DDR) and Nintendo{\textquoteright}s Wii Sports in relation to treadmill walking.METHODS: Energy expenditure, heart rate, step rate, and perceived exertion were measured in 14 boys and 9 girls ( ages 10-13 years; BMI at 3-98th percentile for age and gender) while watching television at rest, playing DDR at 2 skill levels, playing Wii bowling and boxing, and walking at 2.6, 4.2, and 5.7 km/h. Arterial elasticity was measured at rest and immediately after gaming.RESULTS: Compared with watching television, energy expenditure while gaming or walking increased 2- to 3-fold. Similarly, high rates of energy expenditure, heart rate, and perceived exertion were elicited from playing Wii boxing, DDR level 2, or walking at 5.7 km/h. This occurred despite variations in step rate among activities, reflecting greater use of upper body during Wii play ( lowest step rate) than during walking ( highest step rate) or DDR play. Wii bowling and beginner level DDR elicited a 2-fold increase in energy expenditure compared to television watching. Large-artery elasticity declined immediately after both DDR and Wii. The change was inversely related to the increment in energy expenditure above rest achieved during the activity.CONCLUSIONS: Energy expenditure during active video game play is comparable to moderate-intensity walking. Thus, for children who spend considerable time playing electronic screen games for entertainment, physically active games seem to be a safe, fun, and valuable means of promoting energy expenditure.

Response cries were primarily used as interactional resources for securing and sustaining joint attention (cf. Goodwin, 1996) during the gaming as such, that is, during periods when the gaming activity was characterized by a relatively high tempo. In gaining between children, response cries co-occurred with their animations of game characters and with sound making, singing along, and code switching in ways that formed something of an action aesthetic, a type of aesthetic that was most clearly seen in gaining between game equals (here: between children). In contrast, response cries were rare during the planning phases and during phases in which the participants primarily engaged in setting up or adjusting the game.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between the perceived eeriness of a virtual character with the perception of human-likeness for some attributes of motion and sound. 100 participants were asked to rate 13 video clips of 12 different virtual characters and one human. The results indicate that attributes of motion and sound do exaggerate the uncanny phenomenon and how frightening that character is perceived to be. Strong correlations were identified for the perceived eeriness for a character with how human-like a character{\textquoteright}s voice sounded, how human-like facial expression appeared and the synchronization of the character{\textquoteright}s sound with lip movement; characters rated as the least synchronized were perceived to be the most frightening. Based on the results of this study, this paper seeks to define an initial set of hypotheses for the fear-evoking aspects of character facial rendering and vocalization in survival horror games that can be used by game designers seeking to increase the fear factor in the genre and that will form the basis of further experiments which, it is hoped, will lead to a conceptual framework for the uncanny.},

	abstract = {In video game literature and video game reviews, video games are often divided into two distinct parts: interface and gameplay. Good video games, it is assumed, have easy to use interfaces, but they also provide difficult gameplay challenges to the player. But must a good game follow this pattern, and what is the difference between interface and gameplay? When does the easy-to-use interface stop, and when does the challenging gameplay begin? By analyzing a number of games, the paper argues that it is rare to find a clear-cut border between interface and gameplay and that the fluidity of this border characterizes games in general. While this border is unclear, we also analyze a number of games where the challenge is unambiguously located in the interface, thereby demonstrating that "easy interface and challenging gameplay" is neither universal nor a requirement for game quality. Finally, the paper argues, the lack of a clear distinction between easy interface and challenging gameplay is due to the fact that games are fundamentally designed not to accomplish something through an activity, but to provide an activity that is pleasurable in itself.},

	address = {University of Central Lancashire},
	abstract = {Research studying the effects of playing videogames has largely focused on their negative effects on aggressive attitudes and behaviours. The potential positive effects have received less theoretical and empirical attention. The present study used flow theory to permit a wider examination of the potential consequences of gaming for measures of affect and psychological well-being. Furthermore, it aimed to show how aggressive personality was linked to the gaming experience and whether this was associated with consequences for mood and psychological well-being. An experimental design was used, in which videogamers were recruited to play one of two videogames. Pre-test measures of trait aggression; psychological well-being and affect were taken. Following a forty minute game-play period, post-test measures on affect and flow were completed. Preliminary analyses of the pre and post-test measures of affect, revealed evidence to suggest that gaming can facilitate positive mood. Trait aggression showed to be negatively related to dimensions of psychological well-being but was not correlated with violent game content or flow in gaming. This suggests engagement with gaming to be a product of much more than violent content and that aggressive personality is not inherently linked to enjoyment of games with such content. Further research, however, is needed to confirm the importance of violent content and aggressive personality in predicting the social and psychological outcomes of gaming. },

	abstract = {Despite the dramatic growth of gender and games research, many challenges remain in designing a more gender-inclusive game. This report addresses the problem of how to apply the concept of gender-inclusivity into game design. A central contribution of the research is the development of a gender-inclusivity framework. The conceptual framework is founded on the analysis and synthesized information from related theories and research. It demonstrates how the concept of gender-inclusivity can be defined and expressed in three key components: 1) genre, which indicate the type of game, (2) gameplay, which describes the game behaviour e.g. conflict resolution, feedback, challenge and flexibility, (3) aesthetics content, which describes the game content including character/avatar, music, storyline and game world graphics. This framework can be use as a reference point by providing a common vocabulary for discussing issues of gender-inclusivity i.e. literature, methods and results. In addition to that, it serves as a boundary of what constitutes gender-inclusivity in games. Subsequently, it acts as a filtering tool for what is relevant and not relevant to gender-inclusivity in games. Two novel applications of the gender-inclusivity framework are presented.

The first is a measuring instrument called the Gender-Inclusivity Rating Scale (GIRS). The GIRS instrument was designed to assess the degree of gender-inclusiveness in a game. The second application extends the notion of gender-inclusivity to design practice. The Gender-Inclusive Game Design Model (GIGaDM) guides designers in the design process. It helps to deconstruct the overall gender-inclusivity design tasks into smaller, conceptually distinct and manageable tasks. Finally, the direction of future work is outlined.},

Effectiveness was evaluated in task completion time, efficiency as error rate, together with self-assessment measures (arousal, pleasure, dominance) and game experience (challenge, flow, competence, tension, positive and negative affect). Results indicate players, regardless of age, are more effective and efficient using pen-and-paper than using a Nintendo DS console. However, the game is more arousing and induces a heightened sense of flow in digital form for gamers of all ages. Logic problem{\textendash}solving challenges within digital games may be associated with positive feelings for the elderly but with negative feelings for the young. Thus, digital logic-training games may provide positive gameplay experience for an aging Western civilization.},

	abstract = {There have been several sociologists who have written, sometimes quite extensively and informatively, on video games, and more commonly many within video games studies have tapped into wider sociological literatures. However, more generally, the willingness of sociology to engage with video games and gamer analysis has been rather underwhelming, and this is particularly significant, for as Neiborg and Hermes (2008) argue, video games offer a key area for developing our understanding of contemporary audience, consumer and production patterns. Similarly, the general level of engagement with sociological literatures within games studies has at times been fairly limited. Though writers sometimes draw on philosophical/sociological ideas, such as {\textquoteleft}the magic circle{\textquoteright}, which they claim are {\textquoteleft}social{\textquoteright} concepts, there is little understanding or engagement with what this actually means. Hence, this paper offers a (further) critique of the magic circle and similar concepts, but argues that the key weakness of these concepts is their lack of engagement with, and applicability to, other spheres of social life. To this end, I suggest that the (also sometimes used in game studies) concept of frame analysis, does offer a more social theory; however, what is truly needed in game studies (reflecting the arguments of early criminological debates in the 1960s and 70s) is a {\textquoteleft}fully social theory{\textquoteright} (Taylor, Walton \& Young 1973) of gaming.   },

Because portable consoles are popular as a delivery system for multiple types of media content, such as movies and video games, it is also important to investigate whether differences between the effects of portable and television-based consoles are consistent across multiple types of media. This article reports a 2{\texttimes}2 (console: portable or television-based{\texttimes}medium: video game or movie) mixed factorial design experiment with physiological arousal and self-reported flow experience as dependent variables, designed to explore whether console type affects media experiences and whether these effects are consistent across different media. Results indicate that portable media consoles evoke lower levels of physiological arousal and flow experience and that this effect is consistent for both video games and movies.

In the following, we will see examples of four genres that situate the player in different positions with
respect to the gameworld. Command \& Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars illustrates a game where the player does not have a playable figure in the gameworld, while Crysis exemplifies a game where player and playable figure viewpoints merge into one entity. Diablo 2 represents a game
with a developing figure, and The Sims 2 demonstrates a hybrid combination of named, developing figures controlled by the player from a god perspective. The study shows that players tend to accept all features that aid them in understanding how to play the game, and that it does not matter whether features have a stylistic or naturalistic relationship to the gameworld. Regarding the relationship between player and playable figure, the respondents do not see the dual position of the player situated in the physical world while having the power to act within the gameworld as a paradox, but a necessary way of communication in games. },

	abstract = {Ten years after the groundbreaking From Barbie to Mortal Kombat highlighted the ways gender stereotyping and related social and economic issues permeate digital game play, the number of women and girl gamers has risen considerably. Despite this, gender disparities remain in gaming. Women may be warriors in World of Warcraft, but they are also scantily clad "booth babes" whose sex appeal is used to promote games at trade shows. Player-generated content has revolutionized gaming, but few games marketed to girls allow "modding" (game modifications made by players). Gender equity, the contributors to Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat argue, requires more than increasing the overall numbers of female players.

Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat brings together new media theorists, game designers, educators, psychologists, and industry professionals, including some of the contributors to the earlier volume, to look at how gender intersects with the broader contexts of digital games today: gaming, game industry and design, and serious games. The contributors discuss the rise of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) and the experience of girl and women players in gaming communities; the still male-dominated gaming industry and the need for different perspectives in game design; and gender concerns related to emerging serious games (games meant not only to entertain but also to educate, persuade, or change behavior). In today{\textquoteright}s game-packed digital landscape, there is an even greater need for games that offer motivating, challenging, and enriching contexts for play to a more diverse population of players.},

	abstract = {Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) are computer based games in which players interact with one another in the virtual world. Worldwide revenues for MMORPGs have seen amazing growth in last few years and it is more than a 2 billion dollars industry as per current estimates. Huge amount of revenue potential has attracted several gaming companies to launch online role playing games. One of the major problems these companies suffer apart from fierce competition is erosion of their customer base. Churn is a big problem for the gaming companies as churners impact negatively in the word-of-mouth reports for potential and existing customers leading to further erosion of user base.

We study the problem of player churn in the popular MMORPG EverQuest II. The problem of churn prediction has been studied extensively in the past in various domains and social network analysis has recently been applied to the problem to understand the effects of the strength of social ties and the structure and dynamics of a social network in churn. In this paper, we propose a churn prediction model based on examining social influence among players and their personal engagement in the game. We hypothesize that social influence is a vector quantity, with components negative influence and positive influence. We propose a modified diffusion model to propagate the influence vector in the players network which represents the social influence on the player from his network. We measure a players personal engagement based on his activity patterns and use it in the modified diffusion model and churn prediction. Our method for churn prediction which combines social influence and player engagement factors has shown to improve prediction accuracy significantly for our dataset as compared to prediction using the conventional diffusion model or the player engagement factor, thus validating our hypothesis that combination of both these factors could lead to a more accurate churn prediction.},

To address this issue, a large dataset (N = 2,465) on grouping behavior was collected from an online game. Structural equation modeling was utilized to examine how group size and group competence diversity influences the group interaction process and group performance. The results suggest that group size has both direct and indirect effects on performance outcomes. Specific path analysis also shows that group size has a positive influence on the aggregation of group expertise, which has a positive effect on group performance. Group competence diversity and group size both have a negative effect on the frequency of group IM-based chat, which is in turn negatively related to group success in the online game environment. Theoretical and methodological implications of the findings for communication and small group research are discussed.},

	address = {Cambridge, MA},
	abstract = {Despite the emergence of computer games as a dominant cultural industry (and the accompanying emergence of computer games as the subject of scholarly research), we know little or nothing about the ethics of computer games. Considerations of the morality of computer games seldom go beyond intermittent portrayals of them in the mass media as training devices for teenage serial killers. In this first scholarly exploration of the subject, Miguel Sicart addresses broader issues about the ethics of games, the ethics of playing the games, and the ethical responsibilities of game designers. He argues that computer games are ethical objects, that computer game players are ethical agents, and that the ethics of computer games should be seen as a complex network of responsibilities and moral duties. Players should not be considered passive amoral creatures; they reflect, relate, and create with ethical minds. The games they play are ethical systems, with rules that create game worlds with values at play. Drawing on concepts from philosophy and game studies, Sicart proposes a framework for analyzing the ethics of computer games as both designed objects and player experiences. After presenting his core theoretical arguments and offering a general theory for understanding computer game ethics, Sicart offers case studies examining single-player games (using Bioshack as an example), multi player games (illustrated by Defcon), and online game worlds (illustrated by World of Warcraft) from an ethical perspective. He explores issues raised by unethical content in computer games and its possible effect on players and offers a synthesis of design theory and ethics that could be used as both analytical tool and inspiration in the creation of ethical game play.},

	pages = {27-41},
	abstract = {This article should serve as an introduction to a relatively new topic in ethnological studies requiring very specific methods as it involves both offline and online research as well as material objects and immaterial practices. How do we embark on an interdisciplinary venture such as this, and be sure to produce qualitative research of high standard? How should gaming mothers best be studied?
In what follows we try to answer that question. We also assume that not all of our readers are extensively familiar with games and game culture or have engaged with computer games first-hand or as scientific object of study. We thus begin with a short assessment of its current status as a growing genre, whose image is changing as gamers and game culture become increasingly diversified. We also briefly situate games as an academic subject and outline some of the central concepts focused in the fieldii called Game Studies. Furthermore, understanding the ideological underpinnings of play is vital to understanding the contexts in which games and gaming exist because they constitute some of the fundamental conditions of games research. To explain this, we relate the ambiguous status of game/play to the usage of the term --the magic circle{\textbardbl} and of historically ingrained rhetorics [sic] of play.
In our survey of the theoretical land, we notice an increasing attention among games researchers to players in addition to the games themselves. We thus assert that ethnologists have a particular methodological edge and a role to fulfill as games research more and more means studying games in relation to gamers, society and political economy and not only the game itself. As part of a huge industry that is a significant economic driver, games take center stage on a global sociocultural and capital market. Educational programs and cross-disciplinary efforts centered on games and gaming grow steadily. Introducing our research project --Gaming Moms{\textbardbl} we explain why it is interesting {\textendash} and now possible and highly apposite {\textendash} to study gaming from the perspective of culture, the family and the everyday. We give our rendition of how to best study a particular category of players such as mothers and why a marriage between ethnology and the interdisciplinary field of Game Studies is necessary and useful. In doing so, we give specific examples from our ongoing project thus presenting a selection of the various methods we apply in our research. Our examples are chosen around two themes {\textendash} gaming and time management and representations of mothers in the context of gaming. We conclude with a brief discussion of our findings, having thus proposed an answer to our methodological question, and outline some missing perspectives and future challenges.},

This book offers a detailed and accessible study of this influential video game console from both computational and cultural perspectives. Studies of digital media have rarely investigated platforms - the systems underlying computing. This book (the first in the series of "Platform Studies") does so, developing a critical approach that examines the relationship between platforms and creative expression. Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost discuss the Atari VCS itself and examine in detail six game cartridges: Combat, Adventure, Pac-Man, Yars{\textquoteright} Revenge, Pitfall!, and Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. They describe the technical constraints and affordances of the system and track developments in programming, gameplay, interface, and aesthetics. Adventure, for example, was the first game to represent a virtual space larger than the screen (anticipating the boundless virtual spaces of such later games as World of Warcraft and Grand Theft Auto), by allowing the player to walk off one side into another space; and Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back was an early instance of interaction between media properties and video games. Montfort and Bogost show that the Atari VCS - often considered merely a retro fetish object - is an essential part of the history of video games.},

We then present a conceptualization of play as a process through which the player focuses attention away from the undifferentiated action of everyday life toward a differentiated sphere of playful activity. This approach reveals how the experience of play changes as it becomes rationalized through the technological mediation and widespread standardization that occurs as games become large-scale social practices. We propose a theory of the rationalization of play (ludification), which outlines the key components of socially rationalized games, which we then apply to the specific example of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs).},

With the rise in popularity of games like Guitar Hero and consoles such as Nintendo{\textquoteright}s Wii comes new opportunities for game design at the interface level. In this paper we propose three interrelated dimensions for the analysis of embodied and gestural game interface hardware devices. We demonstrate how gestural and embodied interactions can be understood as ludic, kinesthetic and narrative experiences. We ground this discussion in a close analysis of the interface affordances of the game Rock Band and demonstrate how these three dimensions allow us to understand more clearly the place of the interface in the design and the experience of games.},

We find that those who achieve the most in the game send and receive more communication, while those who perform the most efficiently at the game show no difference in communication behavior from other players. Both achievement and performance experts tend to communicate with those at similar expertise levels, and higherlevel experts are more likely to receive communication from other players.},

As a compelling example, we consider the role of ubiquitous computing to support the needs of a distributed multi-user game, including mobility, mutual awareness, and geo-localization. The game presented here, "SoundPark", is played in a mixed-reality environment, in which the physical space is augmented with computer-generated audio and graphical content, and the players communicate frequently over a low-latency audio channel. Our experience designing and developing the game motivates significant discussion related to issues of general relevance to ubiquitous game architect tires, including integration of heterogeneous components, monitoring, remote control and scalability.},

This study presents the results of a large scale social network analysis based on computer logs of friendships in Teen Second Life, an online social world for adolescents age 13-17. Results suggest that friendship formation follows several predictable patterns found in the real world, but not found in all previous studies of online friendship formation among adolescents, including tendencies towards balance and a preference for friends of high status and friends who are geographically, temporally, and physically proximate.

Traditional electronic games have used gamepad, keyboard, and mouse input, but newer game interfaces that require more movement are now available. However the movement and muscle activity demands of electronic games have not been described. This study compared the amount of movement and muscle activity while 20 children aged 9 to 12 years watched a DVD and played games using handheld computer, gamepad, keyboard, steering wheel and, active-input (Webcam motion analysis-Sony EyeToy (R)) devices. Movement of the head, sacrum, foot, shoulder, wrist, and thumb was measured along with activity in cervical erector spinae, lumbar erector spinae, rectus femoris, upper trapezius, anterior deltoid, and wrist extensor muscles. Use of the wheel resulted in some increase in upper limb movement and muscle activity, but the other traditional input devices were usually as sedentary as watching a DVD. In contrast, use of the active-input device (EyeToy) resulted in substantial movement and muscle activity in limbs and torso. These results suggest that playing traditional electronic games is indeed a sedentary activity but that new active-input technologies may be useful in encouraging more movement and muscle activity in children.},

	abstract = {A computer role-playing game for language learning was created in a European project. The process was challenging with a multidisciplinary team from three countries who did not know each other well before the project started. Game designers, linguists, pedagogues and teachers have different approaches to how such an educational tool should function. The requirements for the game were scarce before the project started, so it was up to the team to agree on the game design and contents. We early realised that we had to work much more closely together than what is common in educational projects, so we used virtual meeting rooms extensively in addition to many physical meetings. One important conclusion regarding the process is that small prototypes should have been made very early to enhance the understanding and cooperation between the writers and designers and those responsible for the pedagogical contents. Designers and pedagogical personnel should also have had a much closer cooperation in the early phases to better integrate the learning material into the game story. This paper discusses how we worked together to get consensus about the game. We will also touch upon some of the technical difficulties we had trying to satisfy all our requirements with the chosen open source platforms. We also say a few words about the first reactions of the target group. The focus is however on the process of making educational games and what can be learnt from this experience.},

Adolescents with excessive computer and video game playing behaviour also show substantial correlations with other psychosocial and psychopathological abnormalities, such as alterations in the intensity of social conflict, concentration deficits, maladaptive coping behaviour, stress and psychosomatic challenge, and school phobia.Conclusions: The study provides the first empirical data about excessive computer game playing among adolescents in Austria. It shows that pathological computer game playing can be well described by criteria developed in accordance to substance dependence, and that abusive or dependent Computer game playing shows specific connections with psycho-social, psychopathological and motivational factors. Overall, the results demonstrate a clear need for deeper research on this subject and the need for a design of prevention measures.},

We especially focus on the relations of excessive computer playing with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior. Results: The results demonstrate that children with ADHD are especially vulnerable to addictive use of computer games due to their neuropsychological profile. Moreover excessive violent computer game playing might be a significant risk variable for aggressive behavior in the presence of personality traits with aggressive cognitions and behavior scripts in the consumers. Conclusions: The increasing clinical meaning of addictive computer games playing urgently necessitates the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for clinical practice as well as the cooperation with allied disciplines.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a computer-supported simulation game intended for teaching the planning aspects of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). The game deals with product lifecycle planning dynamics in the Engineer-To-Order (ETO) industry. The ETO environment that serves as the Working case allows the eliciting of important PLM concepts: unified product development multiproject planning and manufacturing planning, links between PLM software and ERP systems, and emphasis on the PLM holistic approach. The game is designed as a series of group sessions in which the different planning decisions appear progressively so that in the last session a complete lifecycle planning problem is completed The sessions act as a series of practical cases encouraging group discussions. The computer system consists of two main components: a discrete event simulator and a planning decision supper system. The simulator guides the game and stochastically generates the different events that cause the need for planning decisions in the working case. The planning decision support system makes it possible to emulate the resolution of the day-to-day tasks.},

Structural features of computer games, such as interactive tailoring, role playing, the element of fun, and narrative, were operationalized in the RightWay Cafe game to afford behavior rehearsal in a safe and entertaining way. Theories such as the health belief model, social cognitive theory, and theory of reasoned action guided the content design of the game to influence mediators of behavior change, including self-efficacy, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and behavior change intention. A randomized controlled evaluation study with pretest, posttest, and follow-up design demonstrated that this game was effective in teaching nutrition and weight management knowledge and increasing people{\textquoteright}s self-efficacy and perceived benefits of healthy eating, as well as their intention to be on a healthy diet. Limited long-term effects were also found: participants in the game-playing group had greater self-efficacy than participants in the control group after 1 month.

The paper builds on data from a research project, Serious Games on a Global Market Place (2007-2010), in which an online game-based platform for teaching and learning English (www.Mingoville.com) has been studied in the context of teaching and learning English in Danish primary schools. The initial research process - which was based on an analysis of the platform as well as interviews with platform developers - suggested that one of the challenges of developing a design for serious games in language education consists of renegotiating the serious games genre to balance drill-based exercises with contextualised simulations that involve fruitful thinking, real language interaction and student engagement. One hypothesis of the project is, following the initial research and drawing on previous research in the field, that the process of designing serious games for CALL may significantly benefit from involving children{\textquoteright}s own experiences with using languages (primarily English) online for gaming and interacting. This to some extent involves transcending the dichotomy of {\textquoteright}serious{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteright}pleasurable{\textquoteright} learning found in the discourse on learning with games inside and outside schools.},

Product reviews are potentially an influential form of marketing communication, as well as a predictor of sales performance. With Hofstede{\textquoteright}s typology as a backdrop, the basic proposition of this study is that collectivistic cultural values place more emphasis on giving face to others, even in impersonal social environments, resulting in them giving more positive product reviews than their individualistic counterparts.Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses content analysis of Chinese and American computer game reviews to test the hypotheses.Findings - The results showed that Chinese reviews use fewer negative comments and give higher final ratings for the same set of products than their American counterparts. In addition, Chinese reviews showed a lower consistency between their evaluative comments and their final ratings. Also confirmed is a common belief that final ratings are a summary of the evaluative comments of the review-texts.Research limitations/implications - Future research is invited.Practical implications - Theoretically, the study refines the understanding of differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultures. Practically, it is suggested that if consumers{\textquoteright} cultural values are reflected in product reviews, international marketers should weigh and balance possible cultural bias when they decode evaluations of their products from reviews published in other countries{\textquoteright} media.Originality/value - Product reviews are a rich but ignored resource with high marketing value. It is hoped that the study can stimulate both marketing researchers and practitioners to make better use of product reviews to further understand marketing phenomena and make better marketing decisions.},

In this DDA mechanism, a player{\textquoteright}s physiological signals were analyzed to infer his or her probable anxiety level, which was chosen as the target affective state, and the game difficulty level was automatically adjusted in real time as a function of the player{\textquoteright}s affective state. Peripheral physiological signals were measured through wearable biofeedback sensors and several physiological indices were explored to determine their correlations with anxiety. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the affect-based DDA on game play by comparing it with a performance-based DDA. This is the first time, that is known, that the impact of a real-time affect-based DDA has been demonstrated experimentally.},

The mixed-interactivity game-play was found to compensate for females{\textquoteright} gender disadvantage and insufficient prior-knowledge.},

From it technical as well as psycho-pedagogical viewpoint, today{\textquoteright}s educational games are at an early stage. Most products cannot compete with non-educational, commercial games and not with conventional educational software. Research must address fundamental challenges such as methods for convincing learning-game design or individualization of gaming experiences. An important key factor is development costs. To enter the market Successfully requires reducing development costs significantly, however, without reducing gaining or learning quality. In this paper we introduce an approach of using existing methods for educational adaptation and personalization together with ideas of emergent game design.},

	abstract = {This paper describes ePet, a novel multi-player physical game based on the WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). ePet shifts the traditional virtual pet games to the real world, featuring with the popular RPG (Role-Playing Game) elements. The game, capitalizing on the wireless communication, mobile computing, and sensing ability, can be played both indoors and outdoors, and thus gives players a new exciting gaming experience that profits by the blend of real and virtual game elements. The physical game acquires physical interactions among players, which can bring exciting and novel features to the game and more importantly, avoids some problems caused by traditional computer games such as health problems. The WSN is a promising technology for developing physical games. Although there is already some research and applications of WSN based physical games, the major advantages of the WSN (e.g. wireless communication, mobile computing, and sensing ability) are not fully cultivated in these gaming applications. ePet, which takes good advantages of both the WSN and traditional computer games, simulates a pet both indoors and outdoors. The pet has two life modes: Peaceful Life Mode (PLM) and Aggressive Life Mode (ALM). In the PLM, ePet simulates the physiological activities of a real pet such as hunger and easily getting flu when it is cold in the real world. Moreover, the pet can date with other pets to increase its physiological values. In the ALM, the pet is a character of an RPG controlled by the player and the pet can have a fight with other pets, from which the pet gains experience for level up. This ALM is similar to the computer RPG games but relatively novel in WSN based games. All of the above features are enabled by the WSN technology. For the two life modes, a friend-making protocol and an RPG battle protocol are designed respectively. The architecture design and implementation of ePet are described in detailed. Unlike traditional WSN based games, ePet does not need a centralized base station to organize the network. To implement a self-adaptive wireless sensor network in which each node has a similar functionality, and solve the network conflict problems in the WSN communications, a multi-hop communication routing protocol is designed for ePet. Furthermore, a PC application was developed as the game interface, from which players can check out the ePet{\textquoteright}s properties and interact with ePet. It makes ePet more attractive than traditional WSN based games without losing WSN{\textquoteright}s advantages.},

The main aim of the research was to test the hypothesis that participants using the game for practice would perform better in terms of the accuracy in applying the triage protocol than a group that practised triage with a table-top exercise. The method of giving in-game formative feedback to the learner was modified within the trial programme and that provided the opportunity to investigate whether changing the complexity and timing of feedback affected learning transfer through performance measured in a realistic assessment activity. The results showed that the participants who practised using the game were significantly more accurate for certain measures of performance in applying the triage protocol. The participants that received a modified in-game feedback that reduced complexity and the delay in giving feedback were also significantly more accurate for certain measures of performance in triaging the casualties. These findings will require further experimentation to determine which attributes of the in-game feedback have the greatest impact on the learning of the triage protocol for the given learner group.},

The framework significantly reduces RL computational complexity by decomposing the state space in a hierarchical manner. We implement an RTS gameTank Generaland perform a thorough test on the proposed framework. We consider three typical profiles of RTS game players and compare two basic RL techniques applied in the game.

Nearly all work in this area has been conducted in a clinic environment where it is possible to overcome some of these difficulties by letting professionals assist and guide patients.In this paper, we present the challenges faced, the system itself and the result from a study where five patients were equipped with a game console in their homes for five weeks. The focus of this paper is on analysing the gaming behaviour of patients, which includes the amount of time they spent, the type of games they selected and their comments on the gaming experience. The conclusion from this analysis is that their behaviour resembles that of gamers. They spent significant voluntary time, and it has been possible for patients, with no prior experience of computer games, to enjoy gaming in their homes where they had no professional assistance.},

However, the products offered by the major manufacturers have a major barrier to their acquisition: very high prices. There is an urgent need to use new technologies in order to provide solutions that present the same performance levels than typical interactive whiteboards, but with a significantly reduced cost. Throughout this paper the steps taken for the development of an innovative low-cost interactive whiteboard are described. The proposed system is based on the Wii Remote command of the Nintendo Wii video-game console. This command, although very inexpensive has an infrared camera, and supports Bluetooth communication. The system control is based on a wireless device, based on infrared emitters, which supports most of the mouse events. A complete whiteboard application was also developed using Borland Delphi for Windows. This application may be used with either one or two Wiimotes and has a very simple and efficient calibration method. The application also includes viewing capabilities of some of the Wiimote characteristics, as well as a flexible Notebook to increase its range of possible uses. The results obtained through a survey conducted to a small set of whiteboard users were very positive indicators about the acceptance of the inexpensive solution proposed.},

As part of this research a simulation was developed using Java in which an agent was placed.

While perceived playfulness or perceived enjoyment has been found to have a significant influence on the behavioral intention to use hedonic information systems, little research has been conducted to Investigate empirically the antecedents of perceived playfulness and the mediating role that perceived playfulness has in user acceptance of hedonic information systems. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to explore the mediating role of perceived playfulness in the psychological process of user acceptance of hedonic online game systems. Based on previous literature, two individual difference variables (i.e., computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety) and three system characteristics variables (i.e., challenge, feedback, and speed) were proposed as potential antecedents of perceived playfulness in the context of massive multiplayer online games. The results indicate that perceived playfulness plays a partial mediating role in the relationship of system characteristics and individual differences to behavioral intention. Both challenge and computer self-efficacy were found to have a significant influence on behavioral intention via perceived playfulness, with computer self-efficacy also having a direct influence on behavioral intention. Computer anxiety, however, was only found to have a direct influence on behavioral intention. Also, neither feedback nor speed was found to have a significant effect on perceived playfulness. The results of this study provide several important implications for research and practices of hedonic information systems/online game design and promotion.},

Computer games are highly visual medium and game interaction involves continuous visual cognition. A system integrating an eyetracker with a 3D computer game engine has been developed to provide real time gaze object logging, a fast and convenient way of collecting gaze object data for analysis. This system has been used to test three hypotheses concerning visual attention in close combat tactics as simulated by a first-person shooter (FPS) computer game. Firstly, the cuing effect of the player{\textquoteright}s gun graphic on visual attention was tested, but no evidence was found to support this. Data supported the second hypothesis, that a player attends to the target opponent while shooting at them, in most cases, while in a small percentage of cases this is achieved in peripheral vision. Finally, in most cases, a player targets the nearest opponent. These results provide a baseline for further investigations in which the stimulus game design may be modified to provide more detailed models of the visual cognitive processes involved in gameplay. These models document the learning outcomes of game interaction and provide a basis for improvements, such as the optimization of combat survival tactics.},

We found that VoIP represents talk in ways that differ both to face-to-face communication and to text-mediated communications. VoIP audio representations interact with, and mediate, the graphical materials of the game world in distinctive and unusual ways which can generate problems to be overcome for players. But they also provide clear benefits for learning and coordination, which are found neither in face-to-face or text communication.

The game is based on an inside plant virtual supply chain simulation and copes with the educational challenges of teaching Industrial Logistics in a new, effective way. By applying a visual interactive simulation package, the game creates a virtual dynamic scenario directly visible by participants, with an improvement of experimentation and conceptualisation phases, and offers several logistic decisions and their strategic links from a holistic point of view. The challenge goes beyond a pure theoretical setting and students learn strategies and gain experience directly by operating in a virtual supply chain and sharing knowledge.

	abstract = {The term "mobile culture" reflects a phenomenal role that mobile devices play in our everyday lives. Accordingly, in the eyes of many current students, computing technology is associated with their mobile phones and gadgets instead of larger desktops that are commonly used in the academic environment. Most of them carry mobile phones with them at all times, and being able to develop and immediately run an application on their phone may offer an experience that is as practical and as close to the real world as it gets. By using mobile computing and, in particular, mobile game development, it may be possible to make course material more relevant to students; this also may show a stronger connection to real-world applications and technology that surround our students.To better understand the role of mobile culture and mobile phones in the life of contemporary students, we surveyed a group of 251 undergraduates, which included 117 females and 134 mates, between 18 and 25 years of age. 100\% of respondents said that they have a mobile phone. 49\% of males and 47\% of females said that they regularly play mobile games; on average they did that on 3.3 days each week. Students were asked to name three different places where they are most likely to play a mobile game. Answers included being at home (41\%) with nothing else to do, in class (39\%) during a lecture or another boring activity, in some form of transport (16\%), at the airport or on a plane, at work (15\%) and apparently not working, while waiting (14\%) for an appointment (e.g. at a doctor{\textquoteright}s office), at school (9\%) between classes, and others. We also asked to name three games that students play most frequently on their mobile phones. Out of 72 games that were mentioned, Tertis, Pacman and Solitaire were the three most popular, while over 40 other games were named only once. There was an approximately equal ratio between males and females who play the top three games. All of the top ten mobile games played by our respondents belong to the class of casual games. Such games are typically played in short bursts of time; their rules are simple, and unlike many desktop or console games, they do not require any major time commitment or any special skills. Most notably, many studies indicate that the demographics of mobile gamers are split equally between the two sexes.Compared to traditional computer games, introduction of mobile game development into Computer Science curricula received relatively little attention. There are very few reports about leveraging the appeal and relative simplicity of mobile game development to increase student interest in pursuing a degree in computing. Compared to desktop or console game development, mobile games are significantly less complex due to their simplified gameplay, smaller scale, simpler graphics, and other factors. In many ways, it may be easier to adopt mobile game development in the Computer Science curriculum than traditional game development while offering additional motivational benefits for students.Traditional game development has become a popular motivational tool; however, it is most effective for students who have already advanced down the course pipeline. In contrast, a playable mobile game could be successfully developed even in an introductory Computer Science course and thus provide a satisfying result to students eager to see tangible outcomes of their projects. Mobile computing can give students a sense of instant gratification - they can quickly compile a working graphical application and play the resulting game on their own mobile device and proudly show it off to their friends.Mobile game development is well positioned to address the challenges of its adoption to the curriculum. Because of a relative simplicity and a smaller scale, a playable mobile game can be developed within reasonable time by many CS students even with limited programming skills. Challenges of developing user interfaces for mobile devices can be a good topic for an in-depth discussion in a human-computer interactions course; overcoming connectivity and security issues could provide a good study framework in a computer networks course; while mobile-specific development issues are a good topic for a software engineering course. Mobile games can help broaden the horizons and motivate many students in introductory computing courses by exposing them to a variety of advanced topics early in the curriculum.As our survey shows, whether we like it or not, students do play games on their mobile phones and mobile gaming is here to stay. It is up to us, however, to use this situation for the benefit of Computer Science education and turn mobile gaming from a disruptive technology into a motivational tool.},

Two computer games and a virtual environment were developed to elicit performance metrics for use within a user study. Results indicated that perceived gaming skill and progress in a First-Person-Shooter (FPS) game were the most consistent metrics showing significant correlations with performance in time-based navigation tasks. There was also strong evidence that these relations were significantly intensified by the inclusion of participants who play FPS games.

At the Institute of Ergonomics (IAD) of the Darmstadt University of Technology, several projects investigated the potential of interaction concepts with the Wii Remote, especially in nongaming contexts. In a first Study an interactive whiteboard according to [1] was recreated, modified and evaluated. In this case, the Wii Remote is not the human-machine-interface but the sensor that detects an infrared emitting (IR) pencil. A Survey with 15 Subjects was conducted in which different IR pencils were evaluated. In a second Study the potential of a gesture based human-computer interaction with the help of the Wii-Remote according to [2] Was evaluated by using a multimedia software application. In a Survey with 30 Subjects, the Wii gesture interaction was compared to a standard remote control.},

	abstract = {One of the major challenges of video game design is to have appropriate difficulty levels for users in order to maximize the entertainment value of the game. Game players may lose interests if a game is either too easy or too difficult. This paper presents a novel methodology to improve user{\textquoteright}s experience in computer games by automatically adjusting the level of the game difficulty. The difficulty level is computed from measurements of the facial physiology of the players at a distance. The measurements are based on the assumption that the players{\textquoteright} performance during. the game-playing session alters blood flow in the supraorbital region, which is an indirect measurement of increased mental activities. This alters heat dissipation, which can be monitored in a contact-free manner through a thermal imaging-based stress monitoring and analysis system, known as StressCam.In this work, we investigated on two primary objectives: (1) the feasibility of utilizing the facial physiology in automatically adjusting the difficulty level of the game and (2) the capability of the automatic difficulty level adjustment in improving game players{\textquoteright} experience. We employed and extended a XNA video game for this study, and performed an in-depth, comparative usability evaluation on it. Our results show that the automatic difficulty adjustable system successfully maintains game players{\textquoteright} interests and substantially outperforms traditional fixed-difficulty mode games. Although a number of issues of this preliminary study remain to be investigated further, this research opens a new direction that utilizes non-contact stress measurements for monitoring and further enhancing a variety of user-centric, interactive entertainment activities.},

Theories of emotion state that definite emotional responses are individual, and caused by the individual interaction sequence or history. Engendering desired emotions in the audience of traditional audiovisual media is a considerable challenge; however it is potentially even more difficult to achieve the same goal for the audience of interactive entertainment, because a substantial degree of control rests in the hand of the end user rather than the designer. This paper presents a possible solution to the challenge of integrating the user in the design of interactive entertainment such as computer games by employing the "persona" framework introduced by Alan Cooper. This approach is already in use in interaction design. The method can be improved by complementing the traditional narrative description of personas with quantitative, data-oriented models of predicted patterns of user behaviour for a specific computer game Additionally, persona constructs can be applied both as design-oriented metaphors during the development of games, and as analytical lenses to existing games, e.g. for evaluation of patterns of player behaviour.},

	abstract = {Teaching game production benefits computer science and engineering students, because game applications are usually complex interactive real-time systems, which are non-trivial to implement. Moreover, game production has a multi-disciplinary nature, because - in addition to software development - a game production process can include areas such as commercialization issues, game design, graphics design and implementation, sound engineering, level design, and story design. This kind of project environment teaches the development team to work and communicate efficiently. Having organized a variety of game production project courses in the Department of Information Technology in the University of Turku the students have implemented complete computer games or game proto-types. Our focus has been on teaching game related algorithms, software technologies and software engineering aspects of game production. We have used three different teaching approaches to organize the courses: (1) the traditional home assignment model where the students take full responsibility of organizing the production, (2) research seminars where the teachers act as direct customers for the production, and (3) intensive courses where the teachers participate in the production as coaches and mentors. In this presentation, we describe the three different teaching approaches, present them as formal process models, and compare them to commercial game production processes. Additionally, we consider the multi-disciplinary nature of game production and discuss how the issue can be taken into consideration in a study environment where the students are mainly technology oriented.},

This model is examined through an empirical study involving 458 participants using structural equation modelling techniques. In addition, a competing model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) is proposed to evaluate whether TPB is more suitable than TAM to explain the use of online games. The two action-theoretical models are compared in terms of their predictive power and their practical utility.Findings - Although both models explain the players{\textquoteright} intention to play online games very well, the extended TPB model provides a better fit and explanatory power. Notably, this study finds that flow experience is a more important factor than perceived enjoyment in influencing customer acceptance of online games. Further analysis reveals that gender is a key moderator of online game acceptance. Practical implications - Online game developers need to search for flow experience building strategies that might assist in engaging players. This study suggests that game developers should consider focusing more on establishing the interactions between players (social interaction) and online games (human-computer interaction) in their marketing strategies.Originality/value - This study is significant for two reasons. First, it synthesises the theory of planned behaviour with psychological and interaction factors and, second, it presents a blueprint for an entertainment-oriented technology acceptance model.},

These online interactive games may have opened up moments of liberation and formulated new ideologies of sexual relations. However, web-based marriages only ensure a male-dominated system and conform to dominant patriarchal standards - regardless of the number of females involved. Re-enacting the rules of marriage, the cyber game is ideologically directed against free unions, mobility, promiscuity, and parafamilial fluidity - all in order to stabilize individuals for reasons of social and political control; at the same time, it promotes the acquisition of skills needed by individual players in a free market, as if paralleling the drastic re-articulation of the economy. I understand the virtual game to be a safe haven for both China and the Chinese people to imagine that they can re-strengthen and re-virilize themselves in a rapidly changing world. They co-fabricate a depthless interface or a pure semblance of a looming powerful China ruled by a male-oriented system. Just as China dreams of achieving modernity through a consistent, dependable, controlled, and {\textquoteright}clean{\textquoteright} path, the virtual reality of the marriage game reveals a social imaginary in which contemporary Chinese people picture their social existence in an unstable transitional moment.},

	abstract = {Educational games have been widely developed and tested by many researchers. Most of results show that the educational games are good to increase students{\textquoteright} learning motivations in formal learning. It seems quite workable, however, is it also true if we want to apply the concepts to business? Or, does it still have effects to on-job-training and orientation in business? This research focuses on the first question. The experience of trying to design and test a Game-Based Learning System, with a joy component, in a real corporation is challenging and risky. This paper shows how hard was to find a company willing to do this test, the negotiations involved, the legal issues and the extensive scrutiny imposed. Constant revisions and postponing, threatening of cancellation and misinformation about company resources needs continuous diplomacy and flexibility from researchers. Prejudice against computer games may play an important barrier and an unfair advantage towards traditional training deliveries.},

	abstract = {Player immersion is the holy grail of computer game designers particularly in environments such as those found in first-person shooters. However, little is understood about the processes of immersion and much is assumed. This is certainly the case with sound and its immersive potential. Some theoretical work explores this sonic relationship but little experimental data exist to either confirm or invalidate existing theories and assumptions.

This paper summarizes and reports on the results of a preliminary psychophysiological experiment to measure human arousal and valence in the context of sound and immersion in first-person shooter computer games. It is conducted in the context of a larger set of psychophysiological investigations assessing the nature of the player experience and is the first in a series of systematic experiments investigating the player{\textquoteright}s relationship to sound in the genre. In addition to answering questionnaires, participants were required to play a bespoke Half-Life 2 level whilst being measured with electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electromyography, galvanic skin response and eye tracking equipment. We hypothesize that subjective responses correlated with objective measurements provide a more accurate assessment of the player{\textquoteright}s physical arousal and emotional valence and that changes in these factors may be mapped to subjective states of immersion in first-person shooter computer games.},

	abstract = {Mobile games have emerged as the most innovative entertainment technology, adding new revenue streams, taking advantage of the potential of wireless consumer applications and service offerings. Mobile games, like any other types of computer game, offer a unique value for users in providing an exciting digital experience in virtual worlds. Players can become empowered through the development of new characters and strategies within games to achieve rewarding successes against the computers and other players. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the factors influencing the usage and acceptance of the mobile games in Korea, based on the extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model(TAM).Based on data collected from on-line survey, we show that perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment motivates mobile game users to play mobile games, and that these two factors are empirically shown to determine perceived usefulness, implying that perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment ate the direct and indirect determinant of intention to use. In addition, se (expressiveness and subjective norms have been showed to significantly and directly affect perceived usefulness. It was also confirmed that self-efficacy and operational quality of device are the antecedents of perceived ease of use. The contents of mobile games as well as perceived enjoyment was used as a determinant of perceived ease of use, and the statistical results confirm that they played a critical role in determining perceptions of enjoyment, and indirectly affecting perceived usefulness.},

	abstract = {This paper is a component of a three-year empirical study of gaming moms undertaken with the aim to modulate the conventional constructions of gamer identities and examine the contested status of gaming in everyday life. It presents samples of mothers in gaming discourse {\textendash} from TV, Music-video, forums, and ads. Mothers have been largely invisible in popular gaming discourse or formulaically portrayed as unsympathetic to/ policing the gaming habits of other family members. Now, gaming companies increasingly target women and families, female gamers exceed 40 \% of players (US and Sweden), and console gaming is displacing TV-watching as the core living-room activity. The Boy-nerd-in-the-Bedroom is, at least statistically, being dispelled and complemented by the Girl-into-Gaming. Still, a tenacious nineteenth-century icon lingers: the Angel-in-the-House. Mothers today do more than bring Hot Pockets to gaming kids (South Park WoW-Episode) or serve as the implied inferior player populating taunts like {\textquotedblleft}My Momma shoots better than you{\textquotedblright} (Q3A). Mothers game too. The paper uses feminist critical theory (de Lauretis) to illustrate the situation of the female gamer as oscillating between the fixed sign of {\textquotedblleft}Woman{\textquotedblright} and the dynamic experiences of {\textquotedblleft}women{\textquotedblright}. It acknowledges and elucidates both the power and consequences of representation and personal experience in meaning-making processes, to which the growing cultural discourse and practice of gaming belong.},

	abstract = {Since the advent of the study of games, scholars have emphasised the idea of games as subsets of the real world, as make-believe and as representational systems. Games have been understood as delimited from the real world by a physical and conceptual boundary that clearly defines what should be understood as part of the game. Players enter and leave the game at will, voluntarily accepting the rules of the game when entering the game subspace, and there is no doubt that players are fully capable of knowing when they cross this boundary, and when they should interpret a specific action as part of the game or not. This paper asks how researchers can investigate the player{\textquoteright}s comprehension of the relationship between a game and the world methodologically by the use of qualitative approaches. The motivation for the paper is a postdoctoral research project facing precisely these issues, and the paper serves as a work in progress for developing a qualitative research method for investigating player{\textquoteright}s understanding of system features, interface elements and what constitutes the game border in computer games. The paper will present the aims of the postdoctoral research project and shortly describe its hypotheses and theoretical points of departure before going on to discuss and suggest methods for investigating these hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Video game playing is becoming a predominant part of popular culture. Games, like Assassin{\textquoteright}s Creed (Ubisoft, released 2007), The Sims (Maxis, released 2000), Guitar Hero (RedOctane, released 2005), and World of War Craft (Bilizzard, released 2004), have attracted many players from different cultures and age groups. In this paper, we propose that the experience of playing a video game, like Assassin{\textquoteright}s Creed, is a personal experience shaped through one{\textquoteright}s emotional values, expectations, knowledge, and attitudes as influenced by culture. To validate this claim, we provide an analysis of the experience of playing Assassins{\textquoteright} Creed from the perspectives of this paper{\textquoteright}s four co-authors, who represent two different cultural viewpoints: Middle-Eastern and Western, as well as different intellectual disciplinary backgrounds, including architecture, theatre, and computer science. To someone from the Middle-East, for example, the game aroused many nostalgic feelings through its simulated Middle-Eastern cities, the use of Arabic words, accents and gestures, and the detailed Middle-Eastern architectural design. While such small details meant much when viewed through a Middle-Eastern eye, their values were different when viewed through a Western eye. From a Western perspective, the game play experience was heightened through the beautiful architectural detail and the use of the environment layout as a function of gameplay, such as the use of rooftops for platforming, fast movement and flying-like actions, and stealth. Thus, apparently the way the game was experienced was very different when viewed through people with different cultural backgrounds. In this paper, we aim to show this claim through thorough analysis of the game as experienced by the co{\textlnot}authors.},

First, I sketch out the formative dramaturgical influences from Augusto Boal{\textquoteright}s Forum Theatre, Paulo Friere{\textquoteright}s transitive pedagogy, and Victor Turner{\textquoteright}s concepts of the liminoid and social justice. I then expand this unique way of play-making into the realm of creative gamaturgy as a way of creating experiential interactions and constructing meanings in the design and creation of serious videogames. As for the aim of finding a new form of thematic analysis for videogames, I use my original case study The Pipeline Pinball Energy Thrill Ride Game to demonstrate a method of recovering meanings from games through the implementation of reflexive gamaturgy.},

Research emanating from the laboratories of Psychology has continued to propagate the {\textquoteleft}effects{\textquoteright} debate by seeking to substantiate the harmful impact of videogames on individuals that are considered to lack the knowledge and strategies to make sense of them. Paradoxically, this stance is presented within a research paradigm that has failed to demonstrate any understanding of the properties of the particular games or the medium it denigrates, broader awareness of the social dimensions of play or the productivity inherent in the practices of its surrounding cultures. The project discussed, draws together what have essentially remained separate lines of inquiry, through applying the critical and analytical scrutiny of Game Studies to achieve a more contextual understanding of young peoples{\textquoteright} experiences with and around games. The primary aim is to assess the nature of violent content within videogames via the experiences and articulations of young people themselves, using a combination of methods to give them a voice that is all too often absent in its one-way debate.},

	abstract = {This report describes the theoretical framework based on previous work and the results draw attention to existing issues in gender and games. One of the problems found in current studies is the tendency of games to be on either extreme end of the design styles. Many popular games are designed for the male players in mind and deter female players due to somewhat excessive masculine design e.g. violence and hyper-sexualized characters. Although there are some efforts in designing games for the female market, these custom-made games were too feminized e.g. wedding theme; shopping; and in pink colour, which consequently exclude the male players. Designing a gender-neutral game is important to ensure that both genders are learning as well as the other. The proposed study aims to design a model for gender-inclusivity in games. It will be based on a critical analysis of current game design models and finding principles that represent the composition of a game design model. Based on this, gender-inclusive elements will be incorporated and a new model will be proposed. The model will help determine whether a game is gender-specific, which contains extreme elements of either gender, or gender-inclusive, contains elements that might appeal to both male and female players. The model will be implemented through a series of game experiments and the results will used to improve the model, consequently contribute to the game design theory.},

This work adopts Wittgenstein{\textquoteright}s Private Language argument as a lever to unpack the usefulness in looking at play from an epistemological perspective: paying special attention to linguistic cues, ostensive relationships and associated activities around those things players call {\textquoteleft}play{\textquoteright} within specific, behavioral, situational and linguistic contexts. This paper explores how unraveling the term {\textquoteleft}play{\textquoteright} in this way can potentially afford us a new perspective on play as an epistemologically dynamic phenomenon.},

However, game flow and structure were largely unrelated to each other with one exception. A low preference for thinking type puzzle situations in games was negatively associated with the experience of flow while playing. Other structural variables showed no association to flow suggesting that most structural characteristics of video game play are not in and of themselves associated with experiences of flow in gaming.},

Video games provide a diverse set of experiences and related activities and are part of the lives of almost all teens in America. To date, most video game research has focused on how games impact academic and social outcomes (particularly aggression). There has also been some exploration of the relationship between games and civic outcomes, but as of yet there has been no large-scale quantitative research. This survey provides the first nationally representative study of teen video game play and of teen video gaming and civic engagement. The survey looks at which teens are playing games, the games and equipment they are using, the social context of their play, and the role of parents and parental monitoring. Though arguments have been made about the civic potential of video gaming, this is the first large-scale study to examine the relationship between specific gaming experiences and teens{\textquoteright} civic activities and commitments.},

What we found was that location and space are experienced differently in the 3D game. Furthermore we found that players of the game series had to learn a new visual grammar to bring the 3D game to a successful end. We will therefore propose that gameplay and the representation of gamespace are linked; perhaps even to such an extent that some types of games benefit from a particular audiovisual representation.},

	abstract = {Extensive literature has shown that games can provide an engaging, dynamic, and authentic learning context.  Many of the studies on the use of games in education indicate that games can support teaching standards and outcomes; however, they do not describe actual uses of video games for learning.  Through the analysis of affordances employed by student gamers, an understanding of how learning takes place can inform the design of effective educational games and aid their integration into contemporary classrooms.  Informed by ethnomethodology, this study used methods of grounded theory provided a detailed description of the use of video games for learning in educational contexts.

Results demonstrate that learning occurs across multiple levels:  the mastery of the computer interface, followed by the mastery of the game interface and upon which students can achieve advanced strategy aimed at goal achievement.  Learning also occurs across multiple granularities:  occurring either in short episodes, sequences of episodes, or trends.  Learning can be triggered by multiple cues, such as failure, game visualizations or specific representations, as well as by peers or teachers in the social environment.  

Students used affordances provided by the game interface and learning environment, specifically:  the visual representations of games afford particular actions; the persistent display of historical context as well as present and future potentials motivates learning; specific cues can grab attention, helping to focus efforts on new or underutilized game tasks; consistent and well organized visualizations encourage learning; and information presented in a plurality of channels is most effective for learning.

The use of social peers in collaborative learning had several effects on the learning process:  peers disclosed information to achieve shared meaning of objects{\textquoteright} purposes, and negotiated to collaboratively choose game strategies.  Peer teams served cooperative roles as information sources and competitively as a performance gauge.

Implications for students, educators, and game designers are offered to better play, implement, and design games for learning.  A brief comparison of findings with existing theory discusses similarities among collaborative learning and activity theory, and suggests opportunities for future work.  Overall, findings indicate a great potential for the use of games in education for learning.},

This instrument gives objective measures of problem use, which can be considered as an indication of addictive videogame playing. We designed a questionnaire for the parents, eliciting qualitative information about their child{\textquoteright}s videogame playing. There were no significant differences concerning frequency or duration of play between ADHD children and controls but differences were observed on the PVP scale. None of the controls scored above four whereas 10 hyperactive children answered affirmatively to five or more questions. These children presented a greater intensity of the disorder than the other ADHD children. Conclusion: While no differences concerning video game use were found, ADHD children exhibited more problems associated with videogame playing. It seems that a subgroup of ADHD children could be vulnerable to developing dependence upon video games. \copyright2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

We were able to demonstrate a significant (p<.005) increase from RS to VG concerning HR (+13.1 bpm), SBP (+20.8 mmHg), and DBP (+12.1 mmHg) with SBP and DBP elevations exceeding 2 SD in all children and 14/17 children, respectively. The energy consumption during VG (max 1.71 kcal/min) was unaltered compared to RS and significantly lower compared to ET even at the starting strain of 25 W (1.94 kcal/min). Hemodynamic parameters tested demonstrated lower HR, unchanged SBP, and higher DBP during the VG compared with ET. Comparing all measured parameters it can be said that the relation of blood pressure and energy consumption during VG might not be favorable.

Commercial data mining software and sales data from a market research firm are used to create a predictive model of market success in the video game industry. A procedure is then described for transforming the classification trees into a decision-analytic model that can be solved to produce a value-maximizing game development policy. The video game example shows how the compact predictive models created by data mining algorithms can help to make decision-analytic feedforward control feasible, even for large, complex problems. However, the example also highlights the bounds placed on the practicality of the approach due to combinatorial explosions in the number of contingencies that have to be modeled. We show, for example, how the "option value" of sequels creates complexity that is effectively impossible to address using conventional decision analysis tools. \copyright2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates issues of character believability and intelligent personalization through a reading of the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Oblivion{\textquoteright}s opening sequence simultaneously trains players in the function of the game, and allows them to customize their character class through the choices and actions they take.
Oblivion makes an ambitious attempt at intelligent personalization in the character creation process. Its strategy is to track early gameplay decisions and {\textquotedblleft}stereotype{\textquotedblright} players into one of 21 possible classes. This approach has two advantages over a less adaptive system. First, it supports the illusion of the game world as a real world by embedding the process of character creation within a narrativised game-play context. Second, the intelligent recommendation system responds to the player{\textquoteright}s desire to believe that the game {\textquotedblleft}knows{\textquotedblright} something about her personality. This leads the players to conceptualize the system as an entity with autonomous, humanlike knowledge.
Through the analysis of multiple replayings of the opening sequence, this paper considers ways in which Oblivion both succeeds and fails at mapping player behaviour to appropriate class assignments. The paper documents places where the dialogue between player and game breaks down, and argues for alternative techniques to customize the play experience within the desires of the player.},

	organization = {Princeton University Press},
	abstract = {Millions of people around the world today spend portions of their lives in online virtual worlds. Second Life is one of the largest of these virtual worlds. The residents of Second Life create communities, buy property and build homes, go to concerts, meet in bars, attend weddings and religious services, buy and sell virtual goods and services, find friendship, fall in love--the possibilities are endless, and all encountered through a computer screen. Coming of Age in Second Life is the first book of anthropology to examine this thriving alternate universe.

Tom Boellstorff conducted more than two years of fieldwork in Second Life, living among and observing its residents in exactly the same way anthropologists traditionally have done to learn about cultures and social groups in the so-called real world. He conducted his research as the avatar "Tom Bukowski," and applied the rigorous methods of anthropology to study many facets of this new frontier of human life, including issues of gender, race, sex, money, conflict and antisocial behavior, the construction of place and time, and the interplay of self and group.

Coming of Age in Second Life shows how virtual worlds can change ideas about identity and society. Bringing anthropology into territory never before studied, this book demonstrates that in some ways humans have always been virtual, and that virtual worlds in all their rich complexity build upon a human capacity for culture that is as old as humanity itself.},

	pages = {A-17},
	abstract = {he USDHHS recommends that children accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) each day. Regular physical activity is believed to be an important component for reducing the levels of obesity. One way to increase physical activity levels that is gaining popularity is interactive video games (exergames).  This is evidenced by its use in school districts throughout the US and also in middle schools throughout the state of West Virginia.   Two of the more popular exergames are Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) by Konami, Inc. and EyeToy Play by Sony, Inc.  DDR is a dance simulation game which requires the player to step (lower-body) on a motion sensing dance pad; whereas, EyeToy is a game that requires the use of the arms (upper-body) to play the games. At this time, there is little evidence to suggest one game is more effective than the other for accumulating MVPA.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in time spent in MVPA while playing DDR and EyeToy. Design: Participants in this study were 12 children (ages 9-18) from a local YMCA that were invited to play both DDR and EyeToy while wearing a heart rate monitor. Seven of the children were girls; five were boys. Each child was permitted to play each game on different days for up to 45 minutes.  Results: An analysis of gender difference of each game revealed no significant difference (p = .455); therefore, the data was collapsed.  Overall, participants spent more time in MVPA while playing DDR when compared to EyeToy, 80.84\% to 53.45\% respectively. This difference was found to be significant (p =.039) using a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test.   For this study, it appears that playing DDR was more effective than EyeToy for accumulating MVPA.  It is important to note that both exergames were played at MVPA for at least half of the time (>= 20 mins), and all participants played the entire 45 minutes except one. These findings suggest that these two exergames could be healthy alternatives to other physical activities for accumulating the recommended 60 minutes of MVPA.},

Participation Analysis of Computer Gamers
in a convergent Media Culture
and taxonomy of ludic artefacts

This text thesis aims to examine media products which are produced by computer game players. Players approach these games in a non-trivial way and are part of cooperative and intensive communication project-communities. Within these communities they generate ludic artefacts in form of videos, images and real objects, produced out of games and by playing. Beginning with a very general discussion of the term game, the thesis continues with examining concepts of the computer game, web participation and convergent media culture. Additionally, a series of case studies is collected and described. The examinations lead to a taxonomy of ludic artefacts, which is divided into six main groups. Each of them contains further six subcategories, which explain the motivations for the production of such pieces of art, as well as different ways of using the medium computer game.

The proposal of this taxonomy of ludic artefacts aims to support the understanding of gamers who produce media artefacts, which transport and communicate the mental state and emotions of the gaming community. Convergent media culture, which incorporates participation of users and collective intelligence, enables a very special way of creativity. Thereby, the gamer is transformed into a prosumer and team player, who is able to articulate and express himself as an individual through these artefacts, travelling between the fields of popular culture and art. Therefore, the social type of the gamer is a co-creative representative of an avantgardistic gaming-, creation-, and networking-community, which uses the computer game as a platform and a creative programme.},

This model allows for a new formulation of the notion of agency, by shifting the concept of the reader from a player-centric model to a performer-centric model. We also show how we can conceive of interactions between performers and authors as being governed by the same rules that are in play between multiple performers in a piece of improvisational theatre. We connect this idea to a phenomenological theory of human computer interaction and cognition which foregrounds the role of communication and commitment between interactors.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the effectiveness of three modalities for delivery of nutrition education. Design: Between-subjects, repeated-measures design. Setting: Data were collected at community agencies or during home visits. Participants: Low-income, European American and African American mothers (N = 155). Intervention: Participants were exposed to nutrition education material in 1 of 3 modalities (a computer game, The Fantastic Food Challenge; Web site; or pamphlet). Likeability, nutrition knowledge, intention to use, and demographic measures followed the intervention at T1 and T2. Main Outcome Measures: 5-point Likert-type scales measured likeability (5 items), and 33 multiple-choice questions measured knowledge. Analysis: Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) procedures using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software, P < .05. Results: Overall, the Web site was liked more than the other conditions with this audience of women. Significant differences in attention, understanding, and intent to use the information existed across modalities. The Web site performed better than other modalities on knowledge outcomes, with no differences in knowledge retention from T1 toT2. Conclusions and Implications: The Web site modality performed best with this audience of women, indicating that interactive computer games may not confer greater benefits than traditional modes of information delivery for all audiences, particularly those with low computer skills. \copyright2008 SOCIETY FOR NUTRITION EDUCATION.},

	abstract = {This work sought to help inform the design of educational digital games by the studying the design of successful commercial videogames. The main thesis question was: How does a commercially and critically successful modern video game support the learning that players must accomplish in order to succeed in the game (i.e. get to the end or win)? This work takes a two-pronged approach to supporting the main argument, which is that the reason we can learn about designing educational games by studying commercial games is that people already learn from games and the best ones are already quite effective at teaching players what they need to learn in order to succeed in the game. The first part of the research establishes a foundation for the argument, namely that accepted pedagogy can be found in existing commercial games. The second part of the work proposes new methods for analysing games that can uncover mechanisms used to support learning in games which can be emplyed even if those games were not originally designed as educational objects. In order to support the claim that {\textquoteleft}good{\textquoteright} commercial videogames already embody elements of sound pedagogy an explicit connection is made between game design and formally accepted theory and models in teaching and learning. During this phase of the work a significant concern was raised regarding the classification of games as {\textquoteleft}good{\textquoteright}, so a new methodology using Borda Counts was devised and tested that combines various disjoint subjective reviews and rankings from disparate sources in non-trivial manner that accounts for relative standings. Complementary to that was a meta-analysis of the criteria used to select games chosen as subjects of study as reported by researchers. Then, several games were chosen using this new ranking method and analysed using another new methodology that was designed for this work, called Instructional Ethology. This is a new methodology for game design deconstruction and analysis that would allows the extraction of information about mechanisms used to support learning. This methodology combines behavioural and structural analysis to examine how commercial games support learning by examining the game itself from the perspective of what the game does. Further, this methodology can be applied to the analysis of any software system and offers a new approach to studying any interactive software. The results of the present study offered new insights into how several highly successful commercial games support players while they learn what they must learn in order to succeed in those games. A new design model was proposed, known as the {\textquoteright}Magic Bullet{\textquoteright} that allows designers to visualize the relative proportions of potential learning in a game to assess the potential of a design. },

An immensely popular form of entertainment among children and teens, advergames integrate advertising and market research strategies directly into the fabric of online games and environments. I begin by situating advergames within broader traditions of advertising to children. I then present and discuss four potential {\textquotedblleft}points of entry{\textquotedblright} for the regulation of these new media advertising practices, which include media regulation, consumer protection law, industry self regulation and contract law. As media regulation in Canada and the US share many similarities, and because children{\textquoteright}s digital media is most often transnational with a large proportion of content originating from the US, the discussion draws upon both Canadian and US legislation, providing comparisons where relevant. I discuss different courses of action that could potentially establish clearer restrictions on marketers{\textquoteright} interactions with children online, as well as enforce regulation of the role of advertising in children{\textquoteright}s online games. The aim of this paper is to explore the Canadian government{\textquoteright}s position that existing regulatory frameworks can be effectively extended to digital media, as well as demonstrate the necessity of enhanced coordination and integration if these regulatory regimes are to remain relevant within the converging media context.},

	abstract = {Recent theorizing around games and notions of play has drawn from a pool of mid-20th century scholars including such notables as Johann Huizinga, Gregory Bateson, Roger Caillois and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Through his articulation of the concept of language as a type of game, Wittgenstein has been both adopted and critiqued for purposes of circumscribing what are now commonly held as the necessary constituents of games including their systemic nature and the acquiescence of their participants to an agreed-upon rule structure: a set of rules which Wittgenstein likens to the {\textquoteleft}grammar{\textquoteright} of language (Salen and Zimmerman, 2001;Suits, 1978; Juul, 2005; Wittgenstein, 1953; Finch, 2001; Brenner, 1999). 
Although thus far Wittgenstein has served as a pillar of 20th and 21st century game theory canon, this paper adopts Wittgenstein{\textquoteright}s notion of language-games not for purposes of examining games, but for purposes of examining the design of games.  The pursuit of this paper is to utilize Wittgenstein{\textquoteright}s lens of the language-game to investigate what it is that informs and consequently shapes and reinforces game design epistemologies in an attempt to encourage a reflexivity about the design practices behind the games we create.},

User satisfaction was measured in 12 children with CP, using a postexperience questionnaire, primarily based on a presence questionnaire. In general, children with CP were satisfied with and motivated by the EyeToy training. In addition, a first evaluation study was performed to determine the effect of this training method on the upper limb function. Ten children with CP were randomly assigned to the intervention (mean age 11 years, 9 months; SD 2,3) and the control group (mean age 12 years, 3 months; SD 3,2). After a treatment period of 6 weeks, the intervention group completed a user satisfaction questionnaire. Functional outcome was measured using the Melbourne Assessment scores. Percentage scores of the Melbourne Assessment of 7 of the 10 children were the same or changed only 1\% to 2\% from baseline to followup. However, in the experimental group, two children improved more, 9\% and 13\% respectively. In conclusion, it can be said that the EyeToy is a motivational training tool for the training of children with CP and has the potential to improve upper extremity function. \copyright2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

A sample of 27 children was randomly assigned to (1) a home group instructed to play the IDSVG at home; (2) a multiplayer group instructed to play the IDSVG at home and to participate in a weekly IDSVG multiplayer class. Participants were asked to play the IDSVG as often as they liked and report the playing time daily on a calendar for a 12-week period. Motivation to play was assessed by the playing duration of IDSVG in minutes and the dropout during the study. Mean age of the 16 children who completed the study was 10.6 $\pm$0.8 years. During the 12-week intervention period, the multiplayer group played approximately twice as many minutes (901 min) as the home group (376 min, p = 0.13). Dropout was significantly (p = 0.02) lower in the multiplayer group (15\%) than in the home group (64\%).

Of the myriad of newer computer applications currently available, computer gaming stands out for its unique potential to enhance end-user performance and job satisfaction. Research in other disciplines has demonstrated computer gaming to offer the potential for enhanced decision making, resource management, visual acuity, memory, and motor skills. Within medical imaging, video gaming provides a novel means to enhance radiologist and technologist performance and visual perception by increasing attentional capacity, visual field of view, and visual-motor coordination. These enhancements take on heightened importance with the increasing size and complexity of three-dimensional imaging datasets. Although these operational gains are important in themselves, psychologic gains intrinsic to video gaming offer the potential to reduce stress and improve job satisfaction by creating a fun and engaging means of spirited competition. By creating customized gaming programs and rewards systems, video game applications can be customized to the skill levels and preferences of individual users, thereby creating a comprehensive means to improve individual and collective job performance. \copyright2008 American College of Radiology.},

These educational principles allow for the generation of several testable hypotheses, two of which are tested with samples of 430 elementary school children (mean age 10 years), 607 young adolescents (mean age 14 years), and 1,441 older adolescents (mean age 19 years). Participants were surveyed about their video game habits and their aggressive cognitions and behaviors. The first hypothesis is based on the principle that curricula that teach the same underlying concepts across contexts should have the highest transfer. Therefore, students who play multiple violent video games should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play fewer. The second hypothesis is based on the principle that long-term learning is improved the more practice is distributed across time. Therefore, students who play violent video games more frequently across time should be more likely to learn aggressive cognitions and behaviors than those who play the same types of games for equivalent amounts of time but less frequently. Both hypotheses were supported. We conclude by describing what educators can learn from the successful instructional and curriculum design features of video games. \copyright2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Game difficulty level was manipulated in separate conditions by adjusting the number of enemies (view, easy, medium, and hard). Infrequently presented single-stimulus tones were either ignored or counted across difficulty conditions. Game performance and tone-counting accuracy declined as game difficulty increased. ERP component amplitudes diminished for both the tone ignore and counting conditions as game difficulty increased.

	abstract = {Computer games have become an enormous industry over the past two decades and have dramatically changed the leisure activities of adolescents and many adults as well as children. More recently there is a growing appreciation of the potential of computer games as a medium for learning. Such games were initially referred to as edutainment, although this is now a deprecated term and are nowadays referred to as games for learning or serious games. Indeed many people now believe that the games for learning industry is set to make a significant impact over the next decade with a wide variety of educational computer games being developed to support learning. Researchers have examined computer games from many different perspectives, some positive (for example, motivation, engagement, learning, skills development) and some negative (for example, violence, aggression, gender stereotyping). One particular type of game that has not been explored in detail for educational purposes is the Alternate Reality Game (ARG), a form of interactive narrative, often involving multiple media and game elements, to tell a story that may be affected by participants{\textquoteright} ideas or actions. In this paper we describe the use of an ARG to help support the teaching and learning of modern foreign languages; by European secondary school children (ages 14-16).},

But learning depends upon actions such as experimenting, comprehending, visualizing, abstracting and demonstrating, by means of which the learner succeeds in constructing his own knowledge. It is not always easy to achieve these actions through current distance learning approaches. Since we live in a society that demands creativity, globalization, responsibility, autonomy and the ability to deal with virtuality and new technologies, Role Playing Games (RPG) may well develop such capacities. The creation of an interactive computer game with RPG characteristics, about the 500th anniversary of the city of Funchal, the capital of Madeira Island, is invested with compelling educational/pedagogical implications, aiming clearly at teaching history and social relations through playing. By incorporating the concept "games to teach", players will interpret different characters in different settings/scenarios, experiencing adventures, meeting challenges and reaching multiple and simultaneous goals in the areas of education, entertainment and social integration along the first 150 years of the history of Funchal. Through this process they will live and understand all the social and historical factors of that age.},

	abstract = {An important factor to consider in developing educational computer games concerns whether there are any differences between learners in their acceptance of games for learning. In particular there is concern that the strong male preference found in playing games for leisure might also extend to games-based learning, making males more accepting of games in learning than females.There is clear evidence that the violent content and competitive structure of many games, gender stereotyping of female characters, the lack of opportunities for meaningful social interaction between game characters and the visual skills required to succeed in many games are features of games that make them less appealing to females than to males. Games manufacturers have responded to criticisms that games are male-oriented by developing games which aim to appeal to both males and females. However they have also acknowledged that boys and girls essentially prefer different types of game and they have also developed games specifically targeted at girls. These preferences in computer games have helped to confirm that males and females have different interests and preferences which are very deep rooted and emerge in infancy. Woudheusen has argued that these preferences are resistant to change as they probably reflect biologically influenced inclinations which are crystallised by socialisation processes.While it is acceptable to develop different games for leisure for boys and girls, with games for learning the situation is more complex. Schools and universities need to be inclusive and new learning methods and materials should aim to be gender neutral. However games for learning are being introduced into a prevailing motivational climate in schools which suits the more committed and methodical approach of girls. Many boys subscribe to the "Not cool to study" view and this has led to a culture of underachievement and "laddishness" amongst boys. It is tempting to argue that the easy engagement and the active, competitive style of interaction required in many computer games provides an ideal opportunity to re-engage many disengaged young men in learning.Ultimately it seems likely that the way forward is to develop a range of games for learning which are competitive or not and which include social interaction or not and to guide students in selecting games which are most congruent with their own individual preferences. As with any other educational intervention, games for learning will need to be evaluated to ensure that they help learning and that they do so in a way that as far as possible does not favour one group over another.},

To prepare future employees to this evolving environment, technology should play a role in education. Furthermore, computer technology serves as a valuable and supportive tool to improve teaching and learning and allows new types of teaching and learning experiences to evolve. For instance, the concept of digital games-based learning (DGBL) has been growing for many years now. In order to prepare the next generation of teachers according to the image of society, teachers must be adequately trained.In this article, the authors describe the design, implementation and evaluation of two courses on digital games-based learning (DGBL) developed for the pre-service teacher training programme in health education in Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium). Both courses were set up as an introduction to digital games and gaming for learning and instruction. The objective was to provide an opportunity for students to explore (i) the possibilities, considerations and constraints related to the design of digital instructional games, and (ii) the practical design and try-out of a game in classroom settings using standard or free software (such as Excel, Hot Potatoes, JClic). Results show that the games{\textquoteright} inclusion in the formal curriculum encouraged them in using GBL in their future teaching activities and enables them to engage their supervising teachers into using games in their classrooms.},

	abstract = {Human navigation in an unknown environment requires an understanding of the spatial relationships of the terrain. For example, a soldier who is on a reconnaissance mission in a new city needs to "know" the spatial layout of the surroundings with high confidence. Oftentimes, this understanding must be acquired within a very short amount of time and with limited sensory inputs. The soldier would benefit from a digital avatar that draws inferences about the spatial layout of the city based on an initial set of observations and guides the soldier either in further exploring the environment or in making decisions based on these inferences. In this paper, we present and evaluate an inductive approach to learning spatial associations using sensory data that is available from the simulation environment of a computer game, Unreal Tournament. We study two kinds of spatial relationships between nodes on a level of a game map: nodes that are placed near each other to satisfy some spatial requirement and nodes that are placed near each other to satisfy the design preferences of a level architect. We show that we can infer both kinds of relationships using an association rule mining algorithm. Furthermore, we show how to use an ontology to distinguish between these relationships in order to discover different types of spatial arrangements on a specific map. We discuss how the inferred associations can be used to control an avatar that makes recommendations for navigating unexplored areas on a map. We conclude with some thoughts on the applicability of our methods to scenarios in the real world, beyond the simulation environment of a game, and on how the learned associations can be represented and queried by a simple question-answer type system.},

	abstract = {The education and training of IT in interrelation to business management at universities is seen more more critical in the last years because of often delivered {\textquoteright}inactive{\textquoteright} knowledge and the lack of reference to reality. By contrast surveys of companies and management executives disclose a strong need for IT managers with a wide range of knowledge and skills: Holistic competencies for analysis of business values, (strategic) decision making in strong time restrictions, thinking in processes, and in particular the ability for communication, discussion and presention.One effective way for the instruction of sustainable and future-oriented decision making is the work with computer-supported business games.Realistic web-based business games for IT and management training, however, can reach a high complexity and in most of the cases demand various elements like user administration, authorization, community tools and a dynamic business model of the simulated company. Hence, a {\textquoteright}from scratch{\textquoteright} development of an online platform for business games is a very laborious and time-consuming process. Existent open source portals can provide a powerful basis for the online business game development. Portals deliver a solution for the aggregation of content and individual applications and moreover offer a single point of contact, customized views and even collaboration features via an easy-to-use web interface.Because of the disclosed source code of open source portal projects, the portal features can be enhanced with the requirements of a business game like the business model or the specific views on business ratio systems or game management tools. These applications are plugged into the portal as so called portlets or portlet applications. On the basis of academic research the chair for information systems of Prof. Helmut Krcmar at the TU Munchen in cooperation with the management consultancy Accenture designed, implemented and evaluated a web-based, computer-supported business game for IT management training for students and entrants in IT management. The current online version of the business game is totally integrated into an open source portal structure."Go4C" regards a holistic approach for the strategic and operational IT- and business planning, controlling and monitoring. The fundamental training aims are derived from current studies and interviews with executives of the first and second leadership level in different industries in connection with learning theory, didactical principles and multimedia integration.In our paper we give insights into the conceptual and technical framework of the business game "Go4C" on the basis of the "Liferay" open source portal. Moreover the paper delivers an overview of the different game concepts and the didactical framework behind the business game. Finally we present first evaluation results of the practical trainings with students and executives in IT strategy.},

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends Computerized CBT (CCBT) as a way of tackling these problems. A number oil attempts have been made to use computer games as a specific therapeutic tool. Most of these have been directed at older age ranges and those with good reading skills. Our work is in the development of a computer game to be used specifically in the treatment of young children (8-12 years) who are exhibiting behavioural disorders. The children in the target group are experiencing a range of emotional problems with various causes. The children have specific needs and behaviours which affect the way in which they will interact with games. The design of this game has involved us in a long term ethnographic study of the children during their treatment and experiments involving two groups of children playing a number of computer games. These studies have enabled us to determine the nature of the game and to establish how the children interact with computers, the types of games they would relate to and the levels of complexity they could cope with. Most of the children come from deprived backgrounds with low academic achievement but have a relatively high exposure to computer games and "sophisticated" tastes. The results of the study and further research including interviews with therapists have informed the design of the game. One crucial factor has been the inclusion of psycho-education principles in the design. In common with most other CBT games it is a role-play game with a set of tasks. However, from our study we can see that the interfaces provided by most current CBT games would have a limited appeal - being too simplistic in some ways but requiring too large a vocabulary for the target group of children. Providing a sophisticated interface but where a limited level of reading is needed has proved an important factor in the design. In addition the player is given the ability to design his or her own character to improve identification. A "conscience" character - the magical do better - who has qualities determined by the player{\textquoteright}s chosen character accompanies the player.},

and passive attitude to violence, the author argues that games such as Mortal
Kombat, Street Fighter, and Soul Calibur are complex in terms of their construction of
stereotyped identity and in the binary structure of combative play. Further, the significance
of the genre lies in the performative aspects of gameplay, which problematize
accepted models of identification and immersion. Once the player is introduced into the
superficial binary structure of combat, then that player{\textquoteright}s choice and agency become the
primary factors in gameplay, ultimately creating space for the inversion of stereotype,
the subversion of gender roles and the possible transcendence of the binary system},

Many people of all ages play games, such as board games, PC games or console games. They like game play for a variety of reasons: as a pastime, as a personal challenge, to build skills, to interact with others, or simply for fun.
</p>
<p>
Some gamers prefer board games over newer genres, because it allows them to socialize with other players face-to-face, or because the game play can be very improvisational as players rework the rules or weave stories around an unfolding game. Conversely, other gamers prefer the benefits of digital games on PCs or consoles. These include high quality 3D graphics, the adaptive nature of game engines (e.g. increasing levels of difficulty based on player experience) and an abundance of digital game content to explore and experience. With the increasing digitization of our everyday lives, the benefits of these separate worlds can now be combined, e.g. in the form of digital tabletop games. This emerging game type is played on a table that provides both an embedded display and a computer to drive player interactions with the game. Several people can thus sit around the table and play digital games together.
</p>
<p>
In tangible games, everyday physical objects, such as pawns or dice, can be detected and tracked, e.g. on the surface of the tabletop display. The tracking can be done with diverse technologies, such as optical cameras, RFID tags or sound (see Mazalek 2006, for an overview). The information from the tracking technology is then used as input for the game, which in turn provides visual output. For example, when a pawn has been moved across a display, the game can respond by ending the pawn owner{\textquoteright}s turn and showing the appropriate visual feedback. The next pawn can then be moved by one of the other players.

The recruits of today not only understand technology in everyday use, they expect it. These young recruits are {\textquotedblleft}digital natives{\textquotedblright} who were raised in a digital environment surrounded by inexpensive, yet highly interactive gaming systems. To get the most from our new {\textquotedblleft}best and brightest,{\textquotedblright} new research into game-based learning needs to focus on military use. The objective of these projects was to add definitive research in the area of game-based learning.
Three research studies were conducted at a national university to examine the difference in academic achievement among students who did and did not use video games in learning. Three different video games were added to approximately half the classes of freshmen Introduction to Business and Technology courses, 3rd year Economics courses, and 3rd year Management courses. Identical testing situations were used in all courses while data collected included game use, test scores, gender, ethnicity, and age. ANOVA, chi-squared, and t tests were used to test game
use effectiveness. Students in classes using the game scored significantly higher means than classes that did not.
There were no significant differences between genders, yet both genders scored significantly higher with game play.
There were no significant differences between ethnicities, yet all ethnic groups scored significantly higher with
game play. Students 40 years and under scored significantly higher with game play, while students 41 and older did not.
These studies add definitive research in the area of game-based learning. The DoD now has studies proving the efficacy of digital game-based learning and how it can improve learning.},

This paper covers two research efforts that analyzed Soldiers{\textquoteright} videogame experience, as well as the impact of trainees{\textquoteright} prior experience on training outcomes. The first project surveyed a total of 777 first-year U. S. Military Academy Cadets who participated in a team tactics training exercise using America{\textquoteright}s Army, over two years. Results across both years indicated that 60\% of Cadets had limited or no videogame experience in the prior year. Additionally, the amount and type of prior gaming experience correlated with training outcomes (i.e.,
performance, training satisfaction, motivation, and time on task). A second project assessed the frequency that Soldiers of all ranks play videogames compared to engagement in other recreational activities. Results suggest that fewer than 32\% of over 10,000 U.S. Army Soldiers surveyed across various ranks play videogames recreationally on a weekly basis (numbers vary by rank). For the ranks with the highest frequency (E2-E4), only about 42-52\% play commercial videogames on at least a weekly basis; whereas, more senior enlisted ranks and Officers/Warrant Officers play videogames far less frequently (5-30\%). Consistently, our research shows that the assumption that most Soldiers are gamers is exaggerated. Continuing to act on this assumption can be troublesome unless certain precautions are taken.},

This paper will address why and how a reflexive and situated methodology could be employed to study cultural functions of play. Starting from the supposition that playing is pivotal to all game-research, I will follow Aarseth\&$\#$39;s claim that any (cultural) approach of games asks for an inclusion of the position of the player/researcher in its methodology. Being particularly interested in games as a cultural practice, I will add to his claim that for such kind of research a methodology is needed that enables us to see games as culture. My hypotheses will be that reflexivity and situatedness lie at the heart of any approach that wants to include both issues. I will show that reflexivity and situatedness may be needed as complementary tools to come to a cultural study of games that takes Aarseth\&$\#$39;s call for reflectivity serious. 
</p>
<p>
I will claim that the researcher needs the combined tools of reflexivity and situatedness because  both situatedness (intertwining agent and environment) and reflexivity (distance/proximity) take into account the involvement of the researcher/player with its material and view this as a cultural praxis. Situatedness allows for game-research that shows the physical locality of playing whilst still relating play to a more global or national context. Reflexivity permits us to show how the researcher is culturally and locally involved in her quasi-object of study through play.

Using advanced gaming technology for leadership skills acquisition has been the subject of a debate over the last decade. The benefits of \&quot;soft skills\&quot; games have been repeatedly highlighted in literature, mostly illustrating success stories of business education programs. Due to the fragmented nature of research on game-based training, the movement towards using games for soft and higher-order skills training for military leadership has been relatively cautious. Nevertheless, the need to provide modern leadership with effective training opportunities continues to drive innovation within the simulation and training industry. Critical thinking and problem-solving skills remain some of the most challenging areas of higher-order skills training. This paper discusses an experimental approach of using advanced gaming technology to develop instructional simulations to teach these skills to the Navy leadership. Special attention is paid to the discussion of the design and development issues as well as the challenges of ensuring the knowledge transfer.

Game-making is especially well-suited to encouraging meta-level reflection on the skills and processes that designer-players use in building such systems. Membership in a community of game producers means sharing thoughts and experiences with fellow players. This ability to gain fluency in specialist language and to translate thinking and talking about games into making and critiquing them (and vice versa) suggests that games not only teach literacy skills but support their ongoing use. Rather than imagining that education can be transformed by bringing games into the classroom, researchers should consider not only the effects of the thinking engendered by those who play, but also by those who design the play.

This study was a qualitative review of several scholarly papers exploring the use of computer video games in the classroom. Papers were chosen for inclusion in the review based on their focus on educational video game research. Review of the papers led to six major barriers, which are identified and summarized in this article. Barriers included negative perceptions toward video games as educational components; the difficulty of providing state of the art graphics in educational video games; a lack of adequate computing hardware in the classrooms to run advanced video games; a school day divided by short class periods which hindered long term engagement in complex games; a lack of real world affordances; and a lack of alignment to state standards. Implications for each barrier and suggestions for future research round out the findings.},

In this approach computer games are just another tool for the teacher which can be dispensed with great success for the right tasks, but have clear limitations and require qualified teachers that can serve as facilitators of learning.},

Within the last 35 years, due to numerous technology innovations, electronic games in many formats have become ubiquitous in everyday life. This ubiquity has meant that games and gaming have permeated into many fields and disciplines for multiple purposes including teaching and learning. Past research has examined the use of both electronic and non-electronic games, but the field of education still lacks a comprehensive framework for exploring the role of the games for teaching and learning, the relationship of educational games to other fields, and a synthesis of best practice for current and future design, implementation, and research. The purpose of this article is to set a framework for understanding past, current, and future research in educational gaming. In doing so, we also hope to continue a conversation within education as well as with other fields that advance research, development and practice within a common framework.},

By replicating an earlier usability study, in which the participants utilised security tools to send and receive encrypted emails, the practical consequences of learning via a Game-Based Instruction were evaluated; the findings show that none of the participants who were given the chosen computer game as an instruction before the actual assignment did make any serious error when applying their security knowledge in contrast to the participants who did not receive any instruction in forehand. They also finished the assignment faster than the corresponding participants. To be able to evaluate the "practical knowledge" acquired, a model for Vital Security Functions was created that allows for comparison of security usage between high-level security applications. },

Schema models derived from the analysis of play provide a rich explanatory framework for the cognitive processes underlying game play, as well as detailed hypotheses for the hierarchical structure of pleasures and rewards motivating players. Game engagement is accounted for as a process of schema selection or development, while immersion is explained in terms of levels of attentional demand in schema execution. However, schemas may not only be used to describe play, but might be used actively as cognitive models within a game engine. Predesigned schema models are knowledge representations constituting anticipated or desired learned cognitive outcomes of play. Automated analysis of player schemas and comparison with predesigned target schemas can provide a foundation for a game engine adapting or tuning game mechanics to achieve specific effects of engagement, immersion, and cognitive skill acquisition by players. Hence, schema models may enhance the play experience as well as provide a foundation for achieving explicitly represented pedagogical or therapeutic functions of games.},

Our work therefore seeks to deliver a conceptual language for the understanding, discussion and design of electronic and digital game sound. The first phase of this long-term research program entailed examining the degree to which it is possible to apply existing concepts from related disciplines such as Film Theory, Psychology and Soundscape Theories in addition to constructing new concepts to account for the unique way games function as new media.

	abstract = {This dissertation concerns the functionality of sound in computer games, with focus on the relationship between game audio, player actions and events in the game. The central questions of investigation in the project centre on how game sound affects player actions, and how auditory information enables the player to take action in the game world. On this basis, the focus lies on the relationship between the use of audio and the player, with emphasis on the player{\textquoteright}s actions and responses.

The point of departure is that the functionality of game audio depends on the dual nature of computer games as a game world and a user system. As a game world, the computer game is seen as a coherent virtual environment in which the player acts and which utilizes sound to enhance the sense of presence in this game world. As a user system, the computer game is manipulated by the player through an interface consisting of input devices such as game controller or mouse/keyboard and audiovisual output. This user system emphasises sound as a usability feature that provides reactive and proactive information to the player. Computer game audio combines these roles by making usability sounds merge into sounds that seem to be motivated by a sense or presence and the illusion of realism in the game world.

The project draws on theory primarily from two different angles. The first is film theory on sound and music, which studies the use of sound in an audiovisual context where it seeks to emphasise a specific fictive world. The division between diegetic sound that appears to belong naturally to the game universe and extradiegtic sound that seems to comment on what happens within the game world from an external perspective has been central in understanding how audio works to support the virtual game world. The second theoretical angle is auditory display studies, which derives from ecological psychoacoustics and human-computer interface studies. Auditory display studies research and develop systems that utilize sound for communicative purposes in computer systems, virtual simulators and the everyday life. The ideas of how different types of sound signals may be used to provide different kinds of responsive and urgent information have been fruitful in understanding how game audio works for usability purposes. 

The study is also based on empirical studies of computer game players and game audio developers. Game developer interviews have revealed purposes and intentions behind audio in computer games, and pointed out possibilities and constraints in connection with game audio development, while the interviews with and observations of players of two different games have demonstrated how actual players understand and utilize sound in the gaming context.

	abstract = {The paper considers the recent academic struggle between "narratologists" and "ludologists", and argues that it was exacerbated by two sources of confusion. The first confusion was differing concepts of immersion as an outcome of mediated experience. "Suspension of disbelief" and "flow" are both immersive states, but they grow out of fundamentally different processes of engagement. The second confusion was the conflation of "story" with the concept of a narrative arc. Interaction necessarily interferes with authorial control over the timing and the details of the narrative arc, and makes it a misleading focus for analysis or understanding of game narrative.
The paper maintains that if we ignore the concept of a grand narrative arc, we are free to examine other parameters of story within the game, which may be more limited, but are also more relevant. These narrative components - character, storyworld, emotion, narrative interface, and micro-narrative - are useful channels for focusing a more accurate analysis of the role of narrative within the design of the game and the experience of gameplay.},

stories in a well-defined, structured format, which is then interpreted by our engine, along with supplemental graphic and audio content, to produce an animated presentation of the story in an automated fashion.

also noted that the experience was beneficial for vocabulary learning, pronunciation, general fluency, and improving reading skills. Surveys and direct observation of student game play offer
insights into attitudes towards personal use of games, the value of educational games for teaching language and impact of different testing environments on the success of playing a game.
Examining the recorded paths taken through this world by students during the game, space syntax research offers some interesting perspective insights into strategies game players employ when looking for the correct path through an urban space.

	abstract = {This thesis contributes to the field of Game Studies by presenting the hypothesis that the player(s) and soundscape(s) in the first-person shooter (FPS) game, and the relationships between them, may be construed as an acoustic ecology. It explores the idea that the single-player FPS game acoustic ecology has the basic components of player and soundscape and that the relationships between these two lead to the creation and perception of a variety of spaces within the game world constituting a significant contributing factor to player immersion in that world. Additionally, in a multiplayer FPS game, these individual acoustic ecologies form part of a larger acoustic ecology which may be explained through autopoietic principles.

There has been little written on digital game sound (much less on FPS game sound) and so the research contained within this thesis is an important contribution to the Game Studies field. Furthermore, the elaboration of the hypothesis provides insight into the role of sound in the perception of a variety of spaces in the FPS game, and player immersion in those spaces, and this has significance not only for Game Studies but also for other disciplines such as virtual environment design and the study of real-world acoustic ecologies.

A text-based methodology is employed in which literature from a range of disciplines is researched for concepts relevant to the hypothesis but, where necessary, new concepts will be devised. The aim of the methodology is to construct a conceptual framework which is used to explicate the hypothesis and which may, with future refinement, be used for the study of sound in digital game genres other than FPS.},

Here we show that playing action video games can alter fundamental characteristics of the visual system, such as the spatial resolution of visual processing across the visual field. To determine the spatial resolution of visual processing, we measured the smallest distance a distractor could be from a target without compromising target identification. This approach exploits the fact that visual processing is hindered as distractors are brought close to the target, a phenomenon known as crowding. Compared with nonplayers, action-video-game players could tolerate smaller target-distractor distances. Thus, the spatial resolution of visual processing is enhanced in this population. Critically, similar effects were observed in non-video-game players who were trained on an action video game; this result verifies a causative relationship between video-game play and augmented spatial resolution.},

Methods. We used data from 5801 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years in the representative 2001 California Health Interview Survey. Results. In multivariate analysis, first-generation Asians measured worse than Whites for preventive health behaviors (lower participation), physical activity (less activity), and television viewing or video game playing (more hours), but improved across generations.

The results of our survey on the one hand confirmed the stereotype of the gamer as it is often presented in popular media: the players of online FPS were indeed almost exclusively young men ( mean age about 18 years) who spend a lot of their leisure time on gaming ( about 2.6 h per day). We also found that the most committed gamers, that is, the ones who were members of a ( semi) professional clan, scored highest on motives with respect to competition, and challenge in comparison with members of amateur clans and online gamers who had not joined a clan. On the other hand, our results cast doubt on the accuracy of the stereotype. This study showed clearly that online FPSG are not played in isolation. More than 80\% of our respondents were member of a clan. Also, the regression analysis showed that the social interaction motive was the strongest predictor of the time actually spend on gaming.},

A simulation model is developed to evaluate the performance of Pastry in supporting such a scenario. Results show that Pastry performs well in distributing node stress. However, there is a bottleneck in terms of upstream bandwidth usage, which can be removed by low-cost algorithms. Results also show that using Scribe multicast tree built on top of Pastry to disseminate game traffic is an effective way to save bandwidth usage. In addition, Scribe multicast tree scales well in supporting the scenario with respect to the tree length. When a tree size increases five times, the length of the tree only increases less than two levels.},

This approach is both consistent with a range of existing social theory and avoids many of the limitations that have characterized much games scholarship to date, in particular its tendency toward unsustainable formalism and exceptionalism. Rather than seeing gaming as a subset of play, and therefore as an activity that is inherently separable, safe, and pleasurable, the author offers a pragmatic rethinking of games as social artifacts in their own right that are always in the process of becoming. This view both better accords with the experience of games by participants cross-culturally and bears the weight of the new questions being asked about games and about society.},

This randomized, longitudinal study examined the effects of being assigned to play different video game types on game usage, health, well-being, sleep, socializing, and academics. One hundred 18- to 20-year-old participants (73\% male; 68\% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to play arcade, console, solo computer, or MMORPG games for 1 month. The MMORPG group differed significantly from other groups after 1 month, reporting more hours spent playing, worse health, worse sleep quality, and greater interference in "real-life" socializing and academic work. In contrast, this group also reported greater enjoyment in playing, greater interest in continuing to play, and greater acquisition of new friendships. MMORPGs represent a different gaming experience with different consequences than other types of video games and appear to pose both unique risks and benefits from their use.},

Design/methodology/approach - The manner of taking advantage from the flux of real-human-behaviour examples inside an online videogame is stated. Then Mad University, a prototype online videogame specifically conceived and developed for this purpose, is explained. Findings - Human-like AI in artificial algorithms can be boosted by means of a specific kind of online videogame called MMORPGs, used as a research environment. Research limitations/implications - Mad University is a prototype videogame which has been developed to experiment with AI algorithms that aim to learn strategies in a generalized fashion. The next research step will be to improve Mad University and to put it to work with hundreds of players and then research and test the effectiveness of the AI algorithms. Originality/value - This paper proposes a new way of testing and experimenting with AI algorithms in order to obtain more human-like results, and claims to have attempted to develop a generalized learning method.},

	abstract = {Bridging organisations are understood to play an important role in National and Sectoral Systems of Innovation (Freeman, 1987; Lundvall, 1993; Malerba, 2002) and Technological Systems (Carlsson and Stankiewitz, 1995) particularly in compensating for weaknesses in these systems, such as access to suppliers of technology, information, finance etc. However, to ensure their role is fulfilled we need to know more than we do currently about the organisational practices which make them effective. Furthermore, we need to develop theory on why and where they are needed. This paper will show how a public bridging organisation designs and manages an effective intervention through analysis of a complete sample of entrepreneurs participating in a series of {\textquoteleft}business clinics{\textquoteright}, co-ordinated by the bridging organisation on behalf of the electronic games industry in the UK. It will show that this globally regarded creative industry has some weaknesses and conservative tendencies, which threaten its capacity for radical or disruptive innovation. It will show how bridging organisations can compensate for these weaknesses.

The UK electronic games sector is renowned for the creativity of its content. However, the games Sectoral System of Innovation (SSI) has a number of weaknesses. Firstly, the UK no longer has domestically owned global publishers. Publishers play the important roles of financing games development, as well as co-ordinating their marketing and distribution. To most of the UK industry{\textquoteright}s independent developers they are distant and elusive (Spectrum-Strategy-Consultants, 2002; TerKeurst, 2003; Grantham and Kaplinsky, 2005).

Secondly, within a SSI certain types of innovation trajectory may be favoured at the expense of others. The dominant games trajectory is essentially greater processing power and photo-realistic graphics, with proven content in terms of franchises and movie tie-ins. The more radical propositions are unlikely to get a serious hearing from publishers. This creates a sector-wide {\textquotedblleft} Innovator{\textquoteright}s Dilemma{\textquotedblright} (Christensen, 1997) where sustaining innovation trajectories of technical advance with rising costs are favoured at the expense of disruptive innovation- newer, cheaper technologies and ideas aimed at new markets.

The more creative and potentially disruptive ideas in the games industry are those that tend to overlap with other SSI. For example mobile phone games are emerging at the boundary of the games and mobile telecommunications SSI. In the SSI literature boundaries are thought to be dynamic, rather than fixed, and involve interdependencies between related sectors (Malerba, 2004:14; Edquist, 2004). Convergence may result in new sectors emerging from older established ones (Mowery and Nelson, 1999). But during the emergence there are institutional weaknesses in the areas of overlap.

Bridging organisations can mitigate the problems caused by these areas of weakness. Our study reports on a regional bridging organisation{\textquoteright}s intervention. The process involved entrepreneurs presenting their business propositions to a panel of industry experts for validation, refinement or rejection. We analyse the nature of the propositions and the impact of the intervention on them, identifying key design and process choices. We show how bridging capabilities can respond to and compensate for weaknesses in SSI in emerging industries, drawing on the entrepreneurship and disruptive innovation literatures.},

	abstract = {Physical leisure activities such as table tennis provide healthy exercise and can offer a means to connect with others socially; however, players have to be in the same physical location to play. Networked computer games support players in geographically distant locations, but their communication channel is often limited to text or audio only. Furthermore, recent input devices that encourage exertion often do not support adequate force-feedback. We have developed a networked table tennis-like game that is played with a real paddle and ball, augmented with a large-scale videoconference. Similar to networked computer games, this concept can support more than two locations, while simultaneously aiming to provide similar benefits known from traditional physical leisure activity such as exercise, enjoyment and bringing people together to socialize.

The specific aim of this paper is to evaluate the utility of building virtual environments in influencing girls{\textquoteright} interest in computer-related educational paths and careers. This is evaluated through an intervention, or action-research, in the form of a class named {\textquotedblleft}Gaming for Girls.{\textquotedblright} This class was offered to middle and high school girls three times over the years 2005-2006. We assert playing and developing computer games can lead to the acquisition of tangible IT skills and a higher sense of self-efficacy in terms of computer use. In particular, we discuss intervention methods that aim at changing socialization patterns by bringing girls into an all-girl classroom, reducing game violence by altering the forms of game action, and removing potentially negative character designs by allowing girls to design characters and game interaction themselves. We assert that within the information economy, playing video games is an advantage.

Methods: A 2.5-year prospective cohort study, comprising 5 data collections, 6 months apart, between 2000 and 2002. Girls aged 12-15 years (n = 200) from 8 high schools located in Sydney, Australia, self-reported the usual time spent each week in a comprehensive range of sedentary behaviors. Results: Retention rate for the study was 82\%. Girls aged 12.8 years spent approximately 45\% of their discretionary time in sedentary behavior, which increased to 63\% at age 14.9 years. Watching TV, videos, and playing video games (small screen recreation; SSR) was the most popular sedentary pastime, accounting for 33\% of time spent in sedentariness, followed by homework and reading (25\%). Sedentary behavior increased 1.4 and 3.3 hours on week and weekend days, respectively. On weekdays, increased time was spent on hobbies (27 min/day) and on weekend days, increased time was spent sitting around talking with friends (60 min/day), computer use (37 min/day), and television viewing (34 min/day). Conclusions: Among girls, the transition between early and mid-adolescence was accompanied by a significant increase in leisure-time sedentary behavior. Interventions to reduce sedentariness among adolescent girls are best to focus on weekend behaviors. Studies seeking to examine the association between inactivity and the development of chronic health problems need to examine a diverse range of activities that comprehensively measure sedentariness. This information will provide a better understanding of inactivity patterns among adolescent girls. },

	pages = {107-114},
	abstract = {Large scale distributed virtual environments (DVEs) have become a major trend in distributed applications, mainly due to the enormous popularity of multi-player online games in the entertainment industry. Since architectures based on networked servers seem to be not scalable enough to support massively multi-player applications, peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures have been proposed as an efficient and truly scalable solution for this kind of systems. However, in order to design efficient DVEs based on peer-to-peer architectures these systems must be characterized, measuring the impact of different client behaviors on system performance. This paper presents the experimental characterization of peer-to-peer distributed virtual environments in regard to well-known performance metrics in distributed systems. Characterization results show that system saturation is inherently avoided due to the peerto-peer scheme, as it could be expected. Also, these results show that the saturation of a given client exclusively has an effect on the surrounding clients in the virtual world, having no noticeable effect at all on the rest of avatars. Finally, the characterization results show that the response time offered to client computers greatly depends on the number of new connections that these clients have to make when new neighbors appear in the virtual world. These results can be used as the basis for an efficient design of peer-to-peer DVE systems.

	abstract = {The widely varying experiences of players of digital games challenge the notions that there is only one correct way to play a game. Some players routinely use cheat codes, consult strategy guides, or buy and sell in-game accounts, while others consider any or all of these practices off limits. Meanwhile, the game industry works to constrain certain readings or activities and promote certain ways of playing. In Cheating, Mia Consalvo investigates how players choose to play games and what happens when they can{\textquoteright}t always play the way they{\textquoteright}d like. She explores a broad range of player behavior, including cheating (alone and in groups), examines the varying ways that players and industry define cheating, describes how the game industry itself has helped systematize cheating, and studies online cheating in context in an online ethnography of Final Fantasy XI. She develops the concept of "gaming capital" as a key way to understand individuals{\textquoteright} interaction with games, information about games, the game industry, and other players.

Consalvo provides a cultural history of cheating in videogames, looking at how the packaging and selling of such cheat-enablers as cheat books, GameSharks, and mod chips created a cheat industry. She investigates how players themselves define cheating and how their playing choices can be understood, with particular attention to online cheating. Finally, she examines the growth of the peripheral game industries that produce information about games rather than actual games. Digital games are spaces for play and experimentation; the way we use and think about digital games, Consalvo argues, is crucially important and reflects ethical choices in gameplay and elsewhere.

While there are some small differences from agreement to agreement in the commensurability of virtual goods and in the ability of Participants to recognize profit from their virtual creations, the agreements consistently give providers the plenary ability to impose sanctions on participants and to change the terms of the agreements. This uncertainty severely curtails the ability of Participants to enjoy the fruits of their investments.

	abstract = {Distributed virtual environments (DVEs) are distributed systems that allow multiple geographically distributed clients to interact concurrently in a shared virtual world. DVEs, such as online games, military simulations, and collaborative design, etc., are very popular nowadays. To support scalable DVEs, a multi-server architecture is usually employed, and the virtual world is partitioned into several zones to distribute the load among servers. The client assignment problem arises when assigning the participating clients in the zones to servers. Current approaches usually assign clients to servers according to the locations of clients in the virtual world; i.e., clients interacting in a zone of the virtual world will be assigned to the same server. This approach may degrade the interactivity of DVEs if the network delay from a client to its assigned server is large. In this paper, we formulate the client assignment problem and propose two algorithms to assign clients to servers in a more efficient way. The proposed algorithms are based on the heuristics developed for the well-known terminal assignment problem. Simulation results with the BRITE Internet Topology Generator show that our algorithms are effective in enhancing the interactivity of DVEs.},

In this study, we focused on two game design features: task and reward interdependency. We conducted a controlled experiment that compared the interaction effects of low and high task-interdependency conditions and low and high reward-interdependency conditions on three dependent variables: fun, flow, and performance. We found that in a low task-interdependency condition, players had more fun, experienced higher levels of flow, and perceived better performance when a low reward-interdependency condition also obtained. In contrast, in a high task-interdependency condition, all of these measures were higher when a high reward-interdependency condition also obtained.

Design patterns are often misunderstood, but good examples can motivate students to work at understanding patterns. Computer games are used in many books and online resources to teach programming concepts, but these examples are usually simplified or non-object-oriented. We present a simple game that exhibits functionality found in commercial games (animation, collision detection, etc.) and show how it can be used as a case study for design patterns. Specifically, we illustrate how the state, facade, observer, strategy, and visitor patterns can replace procedural approaches for implenting the logic and animation of game written in Java.

Although MMOGs take face-to-face conversation as their metaphor for user-to-user interaction, avatars currently give off much less information about what users are doing than real human bodies. Consequently, users routinely encounter slippages in coordination when engaging in joint courses of action. In this study, we analyze screen-capture video of user-to-user interaction in the game, City of Heroes, under two conditions: one with the game{\textquoteright}s standard awareness cues and the other with enhanced cues. We use conversation analysis to demonstrate interactional slippages caused by the absence of awareness cues, user practices that circumvent such limitations and ways in which enhanced cues can enable tighter coordination.},

Analysis of video game programming errors, design limitations, and rule ambiguities suggests a range of positive functions that glitches and cheats may perform. Glitches are software errors, either programming bugs or design flaws. Cheats are tricks for mastering games by circumventing the official rules for play. This article is based on the study of 751 glitches in 155 popular video games plus examination of web sites that disseminate cheats. It compares the standard computer science response to errors, which is to eliminate them, with a common video gamer response, which is to exploit them. The theoretical analysis contrasts games (in which victory is achieving set goals by following given rules) with metagames (in which victory is having the power to define the nature and rules of the game). Several related theoretical concepts are used to describe the complex subculture of video game players, for whom glitches and cheats are socially significant.},

Since MBWA technologies, such as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), Wireless Broadband (WiBro), and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) have been developed, customers can enjoy games whenever and wherever they like. We decided to analyze the factors that influence potential users{\textquoteright} adoption of MBWA games using an extension of TAM. Most previous game-related studies lack a comprehensive approach to both technological and psychological aspects of game adoption and do not reflect a variety of consumer preferences. We therefore extended TAM to include an emotion variable and measured the moderating effects of gender, age, and prior experience on game adoption. Overall, the results revealed that the effect of perceived enjoyment was very important but that usefulness did not influence an individual{\textquoteright}s attitude. In addition, we also find that age can be key moderator of game acceptance.},

The moderating role of social intelligence was substantiated among older boys: game violence was associated with indirect aggression among those with high level of social intelligence. Further, as hypothesized, digital game playing was associated with direct aggression especially when parent-child communication was poor, but only among boys. Our findings emphasize the importance of individual and situational factors as moderators of the link between game violence and aggression.

An addiction factor loaded on items tapping previously identified core criteria (conflict, withdrawal symptoms, relapse and reinstatement and behavioral salience) and a (non-pathological) engagement factor loaded on items tapping previously identified peripheral criteria (cognitive salience, tolerance and euphoria). Analysis of response frequencies supported the existence of a developmental process whereby peripheral criteria are met before core criteria. Players who might be considered addicted using a monothetic classification system involving only the core criteria were shown to spend a significantly greater amount of time playing per week than those endorsing only the peripheral criteria. It is concluded that the study supports the idea that it is inappropriate to use some of the previously used criteria for addiction when researching or diagnosing computer-related addictions.

We had adolescents play a violent video game (Quake II) and took measurements of anger both before, during and after game play. The results demonstrated that some people increase, some decrease and the majority show no change in anger ratings. Unlike past research, we also demonstrate that these changes are mediated by the player\&$\#$39;s feelings immediately prior to game play and a labile temperament - one predisposed to aggression - and that these variables predict people\&$\#$39;s reactions with an average 73\% concordance rate.

This paper presents results from extensive user studies measuring the impact of resolution on users playing First Person Shooter games. The studies focus on the effects of resolution in conjunction with low and high contrast virtual environments, full screen and windowed modes and identification of long-range objects. Analysis indicates resolution has little impact on performance over the range of conditions tested and only matters when the objects being identified are far away or small and are reduced to too few pixels to be distinguishable.

By observing the global performance of a group of homogeneous agents-supported by a nonglobal knowledge of their environment-we attempt to extract information about the minimum size of the agent neurocontroller and the type of learning mechanism that collectively generate high-performing and robust behaviors with minimal computational effort. Consequently, a methodology for obtaining controllers of minimal size is introduced and a comparative study between supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms for the generation of successful collective behaviors is presented. We have developed a prototype simulated world for our studies. This case study is primarily a computer games inspired world but its main features are also biologically plausible. The two specific tasks that the agents are tested in are the competing strategies of obstacle-avoidance and target-achievement. We demonstrate that cooperative behavior among agents, which is supported only by limited communication, appears to be necessary for the problem\&$\#$39;s efficient solution and that learning by rewarding the behavior of agent groups constitutes a more efficient and computationally preferred generic approach than supervised learning approaches in such complex multiagent worlds.

	abstract = {Because of the huge potential profit, the development of virtual items in massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) has lately begun receiving attention. As a successful means for developing new products, the quality function deployment (QFD) has been widely used in devising virtual items. In traditional QFD, information about the customers{\textquoteright} needs and their priorities can be gained through some marketing methods. However, these approaches heavily rely on the subjective results and cannot identify the demands of each customer because of bewildering amount of information. Thus, we adopt the genetic chaotic neural network (GCNN) technique to identify each customer{\textquoteright}s needs and their priorities and propose the enhanced qualify function deployment (EQFD). However, in most of the existing literature, the equations to describe chaos dynamics are fixed and rigid corresponding to different nonlinear dynamic systems. In fact, for many chaotic systems in applications, it is often difficult to obtain accurate and faithful mathematical models, regarding their physically complex structures and hidden parameters. Therefore, GCNN is proposed in this paper, where GA is embedded into the chaotic neural network to generate and refine the equations of chaotic systems. By experimenting our methods with several benchmark methods, the proposed GCNN is found to demonstrate a clear advantage over other identifying methods, and EQFD is proven to be a feasible technique for developing the virtual items in MMORPGs.},

METHOD: Twenty-two eligible children completed a pretest to determine knowledge and confidence levels, played the Sickle Cell Slime-O-Rama Game, then completed an identical posttest. FINDINGS: Significant increases in knowledge (t = 2.828, p =.010) and confidence (t = 3.759, p =.001) levels between pre- and posttests were identified. CONCLUSIONS: It is promising that a simple, interacting CD-ROM game allowed children with sickle cell disease to quickly acquire knowledge about the disease and symptom management, and increased their confidence to apply this new knowledge. Results suggest the high utility of this tailored game to foster active self-management behaviors in this population.},

Students aged 18-30 years (n = 65) either completed the GI computer game or reviewed US Department of Agriculture\&$\#$39;s MyPyramid Web site regarding healthy eating guidelines. Participants completed a GI knowledge test, a self-efficacy instrument, and a questionnaire that assessed intentions to choose lower GI food choices. The computer game group showed greater gains than the control group in knowledge (P \&lt; .001) and self-efficacy scores (P \&lt; .01). Scores regarding behavioral intention also were significantly higher (P \&lt; .001) for the game group. A game-based approach may be effective in facilitating the adoption of lower GI food choices.

Methods: Data collected in November/December, 2004 from children in grades 7 and 8 at two demographically diverse schools in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, using a detailed written self-reported survey. Results: Of 1254 participants (53\% female, 47\% male), only 80 reported playing no electronic games in the previous 6 months. Of 1126 children who listed frequently played game titles, almost half (48.8\%) played at least one violent (mature-rated) game regularly (67.9\% of boys and 29.2\% of girls). One third of boys and 10.7\% of girls play games nearly every day; only 1 in 20 plays often or always with a parent. Playing M-rated games is positively correlated (p \&lt; .001) with being male, frequent game play, playing with strangers over the Internet, having a game system and computer in one\&$\#$39;s bedroom, and using games to manage anger. Conclusions: Most young adolescent boys and many girls routinely play M-rated games. Implications for identifying atypical and potentially harmful patterns of electronic game use are discussed, as well as the need for greater media literacy among parents.

	abstract = {The rate at which frames are rendered in a computer game directly impacts player performance, influencing both the game playability and enjoyability. However, despite the importance of frame rate and the wide-spread popularity of computer games, to the best of our knowledge, there is little quantitative understanding of the effects of frame rate on player performance in computer games. This paper provides a unique classification of actions in First Person Shooter (FPS) games based on interaction requirements that allow qualitative assessment of the impact of frame rates on player performance. This qualitative assessment is supported by quantitative analysis from two large user studies that measure the effects of frame rate on the fundamental player actions in a FPS game. Nearly 100 users participated in the two user study experiments, providing performance and perception data over a range of frame rates commonly studied for video streaming and inclusive of frame rates found in many computer game platforms. In general, the analysis shows that actions that require precise, rapid response, such as shooting, are greatly impacted by degradations in frame rates, while actions with lower precision and response requirements, such as moving, are more tolerant of low frame rates. These insights into the effects of frame rates on player performance can guide players in their choice for game settings and new hardware purchases, and inform system designers in their development of new hardware.

It is honoured as one of the few classic texts in game theory, but some also argue that it is not useful for analysing digital games. Gaillois{\textquoteright} book is of particular interest for cultural theorists, though, because it presents a theory of games and play while also addressing the meaning of play. After analysing more closely why Caillois{\textquoteright} theory falls short when it is applied to digital games, we suggest a slight modification of its categories. Starting from the four game dimensions outlined by Caillois competition, chance, simulation and vertigo - and his two modes of playing, paidia and ludus, we build on his theory by distinguishing two additional game characteristics, called repens and repositio. Both deal with the internal, temporal organization of a game. Repens is a specific characteristic of games that appeals to the player{\textquoteright}s desire to discover, explore and get to know the surprises a game has in store and to make progress by learning from these surprises. Repositio denotes complementary experiences: having to retry, return, replay and repeat a certain action while getting better at it with every try. The balance, or unbalance, between repens and repositio, as characteristic elements of many digital games, determines to a large extent their attraction. Finally, repens and repositio are not only indicators of fun in the playing of digital games; they also hint at basic elements in learning theories and social theory. The study of the interplay between repens and repositio can help in clarifying the possibilities and limitations of digital games for learning purposes.},

A second fuzzy logic model transformed arousal and valence into five emotional states relevant to computer game play: boredom, challenge, excitement, frustration, and fun. Modeled emotions compared favorably with a manual approach, and the means were also evaluated with subjective self-reports, exhibiting the same trends as reported emotions for fun, boredom, and excitement. This approach provides a method for quantifying emotional states continuously during a play experience.},

	address = {Brisbane},
	abstract = {This thesis examines early videogames in relation to a number of current and emerging topics in videogame aesthetics. 

The introduction outlines the approach to videogame history the thesis follows. It offers a periodisation of early games as those played during the period when arcades were the focus of videogame production and consumption. It puts the study in the context of Jenkins{\textquoteright} call for a {\textquoteleft}popular aesthetics{\textquoteright}.

The first chapter gives the theoretical underpinnings of the thesis{\textquoteright}s critical approach to videogames. The thesis compares games to other media as a result of criticisms of medium specificity in philosophical aesthetics and considerations of media convergence. It offers Manovich{\textquoteright}s concepts of information design and information behaviour as the basis of a comparative approach. The thesis generalises from particular experiences of play, and it draws on prior critical practice in justifying this approach. The thesis analyses audiovisual aspects of videogame play, and it synthesises a model of gamic mise-en-scene for this purpose.  

The second chapter looks at the parallel origins of media art and early videogames in the context of videogame archaeology. It locates the emergence of artworks by Nam June Paik and the earliest videogames in relation to changing discourses and definitions of artistic practice and the technological utopianism of 1960s culture. It considers the quick adoption of home game technologies and the early success of arcade play which arise from prominent approaches to media history. 

The third chapter approaches narrative and fiction in videogames. It tracks the history of narrative and fiction as concepts in videogame studies, pays extended attention to Juul{\textquoteright}s concept of fictional worlds, and develops this in the light of Jenkins{\textquoteright} and Manovich{\textquoteright}s {\textquoteleft}architectural{\textquoteright} approaches to videogames. It shows, through close textual analyses of two early games, that rather than being epiphenomena of rule structures, players{\textquoteright} imperatives are embedded and revealed as aspects of fictional worlds constructed through audiovisual design. 

The fourth chapter stages an encounter between the space shooter and emerging conversations around genre in videogame studies. It shows that genre is a multidimensional phenomenon, and that videogames genres can be understood in relation to a broader cultural context. Specifically arguing that the space shooter is a brand of science fiction, it shows that these games refract the genre in a new way, and can be seen as a reflection on the emergence of videogames as an {\textquoteleft}uncanny{\textquoteright} technology of real-time interaction.

Gamespace is where and how we live today. It is everywhere and nowhere: the main chance, the best shot, the big leagues, the only game in town. In a world thus configured, McKenzie Wark contends, digital computer games are the emergent cultural form of the times. Where others argue obsessively over violence in games, Wark approaches them as a utopian version of the world in which we actually live. Playing against the machine on a game console, we enjoy the only truly level playing field - where we get ahead on our strengths or not at all. "Gamer Theory" uncovers the significance of games in the gap between the near-perfection of actual games and the highly imperfect gamespace of everyday life in the rat race of free-market society. The book depicts a world becoming an inescapable series of less and less perfect games. This world gives rise to a new persona. In place of the subject or citizen stands the gamer. As all previous such personae had their breviaries and manuals, "Gamer Theory" seeks to offer guidance for thinking within this new character. Neither a strategy guide nor a cheat sheet for improving one{\textquoteright}s score or skills, the book is instead a primer in thinking about a world made over as a gamespace, recast as an imperfect copy of the game.},

This work is based on various qualitative studies of games and players, and it will also be followed by qualitative and in-depth studies of various player groups. The need for such research is related on societal and media changes: digital media, particularly the Internet and games are often claimed to be among the key arenas of information society. At the same time, in popular discussion and in media, digital games and game players are often depicted in simplistic terms, and most often they remain just framed within the debates of harmful media effects and game violence.

With the increasing of complexity of the scene, the amount of data to be rendered becomes larger. At the same time, the modern graphics card has a more powerful rendering ability, so many traditional terrain rendering algorithms can not fulfill the requirements. A new algorithm was proposed that was friendly for modern graphics card. The algorithm also used the regular height map grid as terrain data. Terrain data was tiled and organized by quad tree. Each tile covered a part of terrain with different detail. The method used which Mipmap used to refine the mesh, and there was no remising in real time rendering. To balance the load between CPU and GPU, many tiles used at a high frequency were cached in GPU, which could reduce the bandwidth requirements significantly. The results show the algorithm which is well-suited for recent GPU can not only meet the requirements of detail but also reach a higher frame rate.

In this paper, we generalize gradient domain editing to deforming mesh sequences. Our framework is keyframe based. Given sparse and irregularly distributed constraints at unevenly spaced keyframes, our solution first adjusts the meshes at the keyframes to satisfy these constraints, and then smoothly propagate the constraints and deformations at keyframes to the whole sequence to generate new deforming mesh sequence. To achieve convenient keyframe editing, we have developed an efficient alternating least-squares method. It harnesses the power of subspace deformation and two-pass linear methods to achieve high-quality deformations. We have also developed an effective algorithm to define boundary conditions for all frames using handle trajectory editing. Our deforming mesh editing framework has been successfully applied to a number of editing scenarios with increasing complexity, including footprint editing, path editing, temporal filtering, handle-based deformation mixing, and spacetime morphing.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive video games (combined with stationary cycling) on health-related physical fitness and exercise adherence in comparison with traditional aerobic training (stationary cycling alone). College-aged males were stratified (aerobic fitness and body mass) and then assigned randomly to experimental (n = 7) or control (n = 7) conditions. Program attendance, health-related physical fitness (including maximal aerobic power (VO2 max), body composition, muscular strength, muscular power, and flexibility), and resting blood pressure were measured before and after training (60\%-75\% heart rate reserve, 3 d/week for 30 min/d for 6 weeks). There was a significant difference in the attendance of the interactive video game and traditional training groups (78\% {\textpm} 18\% vs. 48\% {\textpm} 29\%, respectively). VO2 max was significantly increased after interactive video game (11\% {\textpm} 5\%) but not traditional (3\% {\textpm} 6\%) training. There was a significantly greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure after interactive video game (132 {\textpm} 6 vs. 123 {\textpm} 6 mmHg) than traditional (131 {\textpm} 7 vs. 128 {\textpm} 8 mmHg) training. There were no significant changes in body composition after either training program. Attendance mediated the relationships between condition and changes in health outcomes (including VO2 max, vertical jump, and systolic blood pressure). The present investigation indicates that a training program that links interactive video games to cycle exercise results in greater improvements in health-related physical fitness than that seen after traditional cycle exercise training. It appears that greater attendance, and thus a higher volume of physical activity, is the mechanism for the differences in health-related physical fitness.

Currently the motion of entities is often planned using a combination of scripting, grid-search methods, local reactive methods and flocking. In this paper we describe a novel approach, based on a technique originating from robotics, that computes a roadmap of smooth, collision-free navigation paths. Because the vast amount of computation time is spent in the pre-processing phase, navigation during the execution of an application is almost instantaneous. The created roadmap can be queried to obtain high quality paths. Furthermore, the applications of the roadmap are not limited to navigating an entity. Therefore, besides navigation for an entity, two other applications are presented; one for planning the motion of groups of entities and one for creating smooth camera movements through an environment. All applications are based on the same underlying techniques.},

We are presenting the mousegrip, an exertion interface to control computer games while simultaneously exercising hand and arm muscles based on a handgrip device. Unlike conventional vision or accelerometer-based exertion interface devices, the mousegrip is very low-cost and supports cheap force-feedback through a simple spring mechanism. Due to its low cost, its mobile form factor and compatibility to existing mouse drivers, the mousegrip can augment traditional mouse interactions with an exertion activity to make exercising more enjoyable, and gameplay healthier. It provides a familiar affordance of interaction and supports increased calorie expenditure, hence contributing to people\&$\#$39;s fitness. We hope to encourage other researchers to incorporate exertion activity into their interfaces in order to support a healthy lifestyle.

Diverse perspectives are gathered from seminal books and peer-reviewed journals in an attempt to substantiate or conceivably refute the notion that mass media, the Internet, video games, and other forms of one-way and interactive technology may be stirring aggressive behavior (by way of modeling), as well as desensitizing children and adolescents to real violence that occurs in everyday life. While some developmental theorists claimed that measurable modifications in human behavior are brought about by internal (biological) or external (societal) forces that are equally perpetual and inescapable, others argued that recipes of both cognitive and innate factors comprise the essential ingredients that shape the ego, define the personality, or influence reflective choices individuals will make throughout their lifetime. Because theories are devised to seek explanations for the seemingly inexplicable, theorists continue to proffer formidable arguments in support of their unique research. While this essay threads together selected past and ongoing literature about a disquieting social phenomenon, the intent was not to produce new evidence on the matter, except that predicting outcomes of human behavior continues to evade scientific certainty.},

Anecdotal observations of young surgeons suggest that video game play contributes to performance excellence in laparoscopic surgery. Training benefits for surgeons who play video games should be quantifiable. Hypothesis: There is a potential link between video game play and laparoscopic surgical skill and suturing. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the performance of surgical residents and attending physicians participating in the Rosser Top Gun Laparoscopic Skills and Suturing Program (Top Gun). Three different video game exercises were performed, and surveys were completed to assess past experience with video games and current level of play, and each subject{\textquoteright}s level of surgical training, number of laparoscopic cases performed, and number of years in medical practice. Setting: Academic medical center and surgical training program. Participants: Thirty-three residents and attending physicians participating in Top Gun from May 10 to August 24, 2002. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were compared between participants{\textquoteright} laparoscopic skills and suturing capability, video game scores, and video game experience. Results: Past video game play in excess of 3 h/wk correlated with 37\% fewer errors (P < .02) and 27\% faster completion (P < .03). Overall Top Gun score (time and errors) was 33\% better (P < .005) for video game players and 42\% better (P <. 0 1) if they played more than 3 h/wk. Current video game players made 32\% fewer errors (P = .04), performed 24\% faster (P < .04), and scored 26\% better overall (time and errors) (P < .005) than their non-playing colleagues. When comparing demonstrated video gaming skills, those in the top tertile made 47\% fewer errors, performed 39\% faster, and scored 41\% better (P < .001 for all) on the overall Top Gun score. Regression analysis also indicated that video game skill and past video game experience are significant predictors of demonstrated laparoscopic skills. Conclusions: Video game skill correlates with laparoscopic surgical skills. Training curricula that include video games may help thin the technical interface between surgeons and screen-mediated applications, such as laparoscopic surgery. Video games may be a practical teaching tool to help train surgeons.},

We identified 18 usability issues in MMORPG and presented a recommendation relevant to the issues. Empirical data were applied to a new heuristic evaluation framework. We determined the relationship between key factors and four game categories, such as game interface, game play, game narrative, and game mechanics. Moreover, the results presented 54 key factors for a new heuristic evaluation framework for game design.

We compare the performance of dynamic scripting under three conditions for defeating non-adaptive opponents in a real-time strategy game. In the first condition, we manually encode its tactics. In the second condition, we manually translate the tactics learned by the evolutionary algorithm, and use them for dynamic scripting. In the third condition, this translation is automated. We found that dynamic scripting performs best under the third condition, and both of the latter conditions outperform manual tactic encoding. We discuss the implications of these results, and the performance of dynamic scripting for adaptive game AI from the perspective of machine learning research and commercial game development.},

The purpose of the present study is to contribute to the understanding of the portrayal of gender and race in games. Previous research on game content has revealed that stereotypical masculine characters dominate video games and that those characters are generally White. Nowadays, quite a few video games have women in leading parts; Tomb Raider{\textquoteright}s Lara Croft is the prototypical example. In our study we investigated the so-called {\textquoteright}Lara phenomenon,{\textquoteright} that is, the appearance of a competent female character in a dominant position. We also studied the portrayal of men and the race of both male and female characters. We did a content analysis on the introductory films of 12 contemporary video games. Our results show that female characters appeared as often in leading parts as male characters did. They were portrayed with a sexualized emphasis on female features. Most game characters belonged to the dominant White race, the heroes exclusively so.},

Finally, we discuss how physical gaming in the home surfaces questions and issues for householders and researchers around adoption, gender and both space and place.

The thesis is that this process gives rise to the formation of communities and the unpredictable configuration of space.

There is a concern that something is wrong with these violent games, but, since the violence is virtual rather than real, it is difficult to specify the nature of the wrongness. Since there is no proven causal connection between video-game violence and real violence, philosophical analysis can be particularly helpful in locating potential sources of wrongness in ultra-violent video games. To this end, this paper analyzes video game violence through the lens of utilitarian, Kantian, and post-modern perspectives. Through these analyses, several explanations of the wrongness in violent video games emerge.

In trying to understand user experience in interactive technologies such as computer games and virtual environments, reliable and valid concepts are needed for measuring relevant user reactions and experiences. Here we present our approach to create both theoretically and methodologically sound methods for quantification of the rich user experience in different digital environments. Our approach is based on the idea that the experience received from a content presented with a specific technology is always a result of a complex psychological interpretation process, which components should be understood. The main aim of our approach is to grasp the complex and multivariate nature of the experience and make it measurable. We will present our two basic measurement frameworks, which have been developed and tested in large data set (n=2182). The 15 measurement scales extracted from these models are applied to digital gaming with a head-mounted display and a table-top display. The results show how it is possible to map between experience, technology variables and the background of the user (e.g., gender). This approach can help to optimize, for example, the contents for specific viewing devices or viewing situations.},

The recent emergence of violent video games has raised new questions regarding the effects of violent media. The General Aggression Model (GAM) predicts that exposure to violent media increases aggressive behavior through one of three primary pathways (arousal, cognitions, and affect). Past psychophysiological research has supported GAM but has been limited to examining arousal-related variables. Recent advances in social neuroscience have opened the door to investigations of exposure to violent media on cognitive and affective components and their neurocognitive underpinnings. Neuroscience tools have the potential to provide answers to the new questions posed by recent advances in media technology.

	abstract = {Being one of the most commercially successful entertainment software applications, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) continue to expand in term of the revenue they generate as well as the involvement of users who congregate in their virtual space and form communities around them to support each other. Unlike conventional offline computer games, or networked games with limited numbers of players, MMORPGs are not merely software applications as they are usually seen as a space with complicated dynamics of social interactions. Hence, it is believed that playing these games might cause cognitive overload problems among the players as they have to constantly interact with the game world as well as with other users. We conducted an exploratory study using qualitative methods to explore cognitive overloads in Maple Story, a typical MMORPG. Our results reveal that several types of cognitive overloads emerge during the game playing. While some of these overloads pose serious problems even to expert players, players seem to develop strategies to overcome them. It is found that some forms of cognitive load are actually desirable in order to make the game challenging. We have also created a set of recommendations that can help game developers handle cognitive load problems in MMORPGs.},

Background: Anecdotal reports suggest that motion sickness may occur among players of contemporary commercial console video games. Methods: Participants played standard console video games using an Xbox game system. We varied the participants\&$\#$39; posture (standing vs. sitting) and the game (two Xbox games). Participants played for up to 50 min and were asked to discontinue if they experienced any symptoms of motion sickness. Results: Sickness occurred in all conditions, but it was more common during standing. During seated play there were significant differences in head motion between sick and well participants before the onset of motion sickness. Conclusion: The results indicate that commercial console video game systems can induce motion sickness when presented via a head-mounted display and support the hypothesis that motion sickness is preceded by instability in the control of seated posture. Application: Potential applications of this research include changes in the design of console video games and recommendations for how such systems should be used.

	abstract = {Recently a new generation of virtual worlds has emerged in which users are provided with open-ended modelling tools with which they can create and modify world content. The result is evolving virtual spaces for commerce, education and social interaction. In general, these virtual worlds are not games and have no concept of winning, however the open-ended modelling capacity is nonetheless compelling. The rising popularity of open-ended virtual worlds suggests that there may also be potential for a new generation of computer games situated in open-ended environments. A key issue with the development of such games, however, is the design of non-player characters which can respond autonomously to unpredictable, open-ended changes to their environment. This paper considers the impact of open-ended modelling on character development in simulation games. Motivated reinforcement learning using context-free grammars is proposed as a means of representing unpredictable, evolving worlds for character reasoning. This technique is used to design adaptive characters for the Second Life virtual world to create a new kind of open-ended simulation game.

The intrinsic motivation of the addicts was also higher than the nonaddicts. The results imply that intrinsic motivation plays a crucial role in gaming addiction. Study 2 was conducted to examine whether four factors that moderate the detrimental effect of extrinsic motivators on intrinsic motivation would function as predicted. Results indicated that extrinsic rewards would undermine intrinsic motivation when they were high expectancy, high relevance, tangible, and noncontingent. Thus, players{\textquoteright} intrinsic motivation would be higher when extrinsic rewards were low expectancy, low relevance, intangible, and contingent.

	abstract = {There is a large disparity between the rich physical interfaces of co-located arcade games and the generic input devices seen in most home console systems. In this article we argue that a digital table is a conducive form factor for general co-located home gaming as it affords: (a) seating in collaboratively relevant positions that give all equal opportunity to reach into the surface and share a common view; (b) rich whole-handed gesture input usually seen only when handling physical objects; (c) the ability to monitor how others use space and access objects on the surface; and (d) the ability to communicate with each other and interact on top of the surface via gestures and verbal utterance. Our thesis is that multimodal gesture and speech input benefits collaborative interaction over such a digital table. To investigate this thesis, we designed a multimodal, multiplayer gaming environment that allows players to interact directly atop a digital table via speech and rich whole-hand gestures. We transform two commercial single-player computer games, representing a strategy and simulation game genre, to work within this setting.

The PDI framework enables virtual characters to take roles for various educational purposes based on the learner model of that learner and learner models of other learners. These virtual characters are designed in such a way that when they interact with a learner, the learner is actually improving her learning status. Based on this framework, a video learning game, called My-Pet-and-Her-Friends, is developed to address some relevant issues in the learning process, in particular, the issues of engagement and reflection of the learner.

After the device was applied, he/she played a video game while listening to the audio portion of the game through the earphones. Nitrous oxide in oxygen was administered via the nasal piece of the headset starting at 50\% and increasing to 70\%, in 10\% increments every 8 min. Treatment failures, vital signs, arterial oxygen saturation, depth of sedation, airway patency, side effects, acceptance of the device and parental satisfaction were all evaluated. Results: Of 100 children included, treatment failure occurred in 18\% mainly because of poor tolerance of the device. At least 96\% of the children who completed the study exhibited an excellent degree of sedation, 22\% had side effects, and none experienced serious airway obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were the most common side effects and no patients had hemodynamic instability. Conclusions: The PediSedate (R) device combines nonpharmacologic with pharmacologic methods of sedation. Most of the children we evaluated were able to tolerate the PediSedate (R) device and achieved an adequate degree of sedation.},

	abstract = {In the last few years the importance of multiplayer games has seen an immense growth. On par with that, the virtual environments (VEs) increased in their size. Today there exist more than 120 MMOGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Games) ranging from FPS (first person shooter) to classic RPG (role playing game) settings. Such an evolution leads to the fact that players start to \&quot;live\&quot; in a virtual world. Thus each player at least partially merges with his character (playing figure) and acts in the virtual world. Nevertheless there can be huge gaps between ones real and virtual behavior. This paper uses a well balanced set of questions based on the psychological big5 model to show the mentioned gaps between real world and virtual world attitude. The underlying online survey models 30 selected questions about online and real world behavior. The results are stored in a database in order to statistically interpret them afterwards. The analysis includes correlations between deterministic values (such as age, nationality and gender) and traits of the big5 model (like surgery, emotional stability and conscientiousness). Furthermore it contains other surprising conclusions about the difference in behavior.

Several robotic billiards players have recently been developed. These systems address the task of executing shots on a physical table, but so far have incorporated little strategic reasoning. They require artificial intelligence to select the {\textquoteright}best{\textquoteright} shot taking into account the accuracy of the robot, the noise inherent in the domain, the continuous nature of the search space, the difficulty of the shot, and the goal of maximizing the chances of winning. This article describes the program PickPocket, the winner of the simulated 8-ball tournaments at the 10th and 11th Computer Olympiad competitions. PickPocket is based on the traditional search framework, familiar from games such as chess, adapted to the continuous stochastic domain of billiards. Experimental results are presented exploring the properties of two search algorithms, Monte-Carlo search and Probabilistic search.},

Digital games have become an increasingly pervasive aspect of everyday life as well as an embattled cultural phenomenon in the twenty-first century. As new media technologies diffuse around the world and as the depth and complexity of gaming networks increase, scholars are becoming increasingly savvy in their approach to digital games. While aesthetic and psychological approaches to the study of digital games have garnered the most attention in the past, scholars have only recently begun to study the important social and cultural aspects of digital games.

This study sketches some of the various trajectories of digital games in modern Western societies, looking first at the growth and persistence of the moral panic that continues to accompany massive public interest in digital games. The book then continues with what it deems a new phase of games research exemplified by systematic examination of specific aspects of digital games and gaming. Section One includes four chapters that collectively consider politics and the negotiation of power in game worlds. Section Two details the ideological webs within which games are produced and consumed. Specifically, this important section offers a critical cultural analysis of the hegemony that exists within games and its influence upon players{\textquoteright} personal ideologies. To conclude this analysis, Section Three examines game design features that relate to players{\textquoteright} self-characterization and social development within digital game worlds. Section Four explores the important relationship between the producers and consumers of digital games, especially insomuch as this relationship is giving rise to a community of novices and professionals who will together determine the future of gaming and{\textemdash}to a degree{\textemdash}popular culture.

	abstract = {Although there is considerable interest in the idea of using games for learning, success in this area has proven elusive. Clearly it is challenging to take established curricula developed for other media types and attempt to fit them into open-ended game contexts where content is secondary to experience. Digital games are very effective for learning, but they represent a type of productive play that does not fit neatly within established educational paradigms. Furthermore, play and learning take on new dimensions within the context of an increasingly participatory culture that blurs traditional boundaries between producers and consumers, as well as teachers and learners. In participatory contexts, learning is a systemic activity where the contributions of the individual contribute to the larger collective intelligence, and learning is often a by-product of play or creativity. Attempts to use games for learning must take this broader context into account and acknowledge the shifting expectations and emerging literacies of learners steeped in a digital culture that introduces and reinforces new standards for play and participation.},

Along with the success of the massively multiplayer role-playing gaming industry in Asia, online gaming-related crimes have grown at an amazing rate. Most of the criminal cases are related to virtual properties since markets have developed for the virtual properties giving them real world values. There has been little research and resulting technologies for MMORPG virtual property protection. In order to reduce the crimes and protect online gaming systems, one potential solution is protecting the virtual properties in online gaming systems. In this paper, we propose a virtual property management language to meter the use of virtual property. The language provides a framework for managing the use of virtual properties and recording the history of transactions to trace the life of virtual properties.

We also identify and discuss the different means by which a user might interact with the content to create novel and engaging experiences. The Scene-Driver model has been instantiated using content from an animated children{\textquoteright}s television series called Tiny Planets, which is aimed at children of 5-7-year old. This type of material, being story-based itself,]ends itself particularly well to the application of narrative constraints to scene reordering, to provide coherence to the experience of interacting with the content. We propose an interactive narrative-driven game architecture, in which a user generates novel narratives from existing content by placing "domino" like tiles. These tiles act as "glue" between scenes and each the choice dictates certain properties of the next scene to be shown within a game. There are three different game-types, based on three different ways in which tiles can be matched to scenes. We introduce algorithms for generating legal tile-sets for each of these three game-types, which can be extended to include narrative constraints. This ensures that all novel orderings adhere to a minimum narrative plan, which has been identified based on analysis of the Tiny Planets series and on narrative theories. We also suggest ways in which basic narratives can be enhanced by the inclusion of directorial techniques and by the use of more complex plot structures.

A very important aspect of computer games is the artificial intelligence (AI) of non-player characters. To create interesting AI in games today, developers or players have to create complex, dynamic behavior for a very small number of characters, but neither the game engines nor the style of AI programming enables intelligent behavior that scales to a very large number of non-player characters. In this paper we make a first step towards truly scalable AI in computer games by modeling game AI as a data management problem. We present a highly expressive scripting language SGL that provides game designers and players with a data-driven AI scheme for customizing behavior for individual non-player characters. We use sophisticated query processing and indexing techniques to efficiently execute large numbers of SGL scripts, thus providing a framework for games with a truly epic number of non-player characters.

While games of the role-playing genre already allow thousands of users to concurrently participate in a single game session, there are important genres, in particular action and strategy games, which have not been scaled to the massively multiplayer realm so far. These games have hard requirements in terms of scalability, in particular regarding density: many players tend to congregate in small locations. In this paper, we outline our novel approach of replication-based parallelisation for scaling the density of players. The practical impact of our work is demonstrated by porting the popular action game QFusion, based on the famous Quake 2, onto our proxy-server system architecture using the replication approach. The experiments with the ported QFusion demonstrate its high responsiveness and show that our approach allows to almost triple the maximum number of simultaneous players on four servers as compared with a single-server version.

	abstract = {The traditional approach to implementing interactions between a player character (PC) and objects in computer games is to write scripts in a procedural scripting language. These scripts are usually so complex that they must be written by a computer programmer rather than by the author of the game story. This interruption in the game story authoring process has two distinct disadvantages: it increases the cost of game production and it introduces a disconnect between the author{\textquoteright}s intentions and the interactions produced from the programmer{\textquoteright}s written scripts. We introduce a mechanism to solve these problems. We show that game authors (non-programmers) can generate the necessary scripts for implementing meaningful interactions between the PC and game objects using a three-step process. In the first step, the author uses a generative pattern (concept) to create a high-level description of a commonly occurring game scenario. In the second step, the author uses a standard set of adaptation operations to customize the high-level description to the particular circumstances of the story that is being told. In the third step, the author presses a button that automatically generates scripting code from the adapted pattern. We describe the results of three studies in which a combined total of 56 game story authors used this three-step process to construct Neverwinter Nights game stories, using a tool called ScriptEase. We believe that this generative/adaptive process is the key to future game story scripting. More generally, this article advocates the development of adaptive programming as an alternative to current constructive programming techniques, as well as the application of adaptive programming in many domains.},

We hypothesized that males would be portrayed more often, but that females would be portrayed in a more hyper-sexualized manner. Male characters were almost four times more frequently portrayed than female characters and were given significantly more game relevant action. However, in spite of their less frequent appearance, female characters were more likely to be portrayed with exaggerated, and often objectified, sexiness. Further, violence and sexiness was paired more frequently for female characters than violence and muscular physiques for the male characters. The potential influence these negative portrayals could have on gamers is discussed.

For weekdays, African American adolescents, Asian children, and those with earlier school start times and longer travel times to school reported fewer sleep hours. More time spent watching television (for children), doing homework (for adolescents), and engaging in religious activities predicted fewer hours, whereas a longer time spent on meals predicted greater hours of weekday sleep. For younger children, greater parental warmth predicted more hours of weekday sleep, whereas for adolescents, stricter household rules were protective. On weekends, African American adolescents and Hispanic children slept less, and there were strong effects of activity choices including time spent on television, computer and video-games, sports, religious activities, socializing, and employment. In accounting for age-related decreases in sleep hours from childhood to adolescence, earlier school start times, greater hours of homework, greater paid employment, less time spent on meals, and fewer household rules were all significant mediators.

This study explored the social interactions that occur both within and outside of MMORPGs. The sample consisted of 912 self-selected MMORPG players from 45 countries. MMORPGs were found to be highly socially interactive environments providing the opportunity to create strong friendships and emotional relationships. The study demonstrated that the social interactions in online gaming form a considerable element in the enjoyment of playing. The study showed MMORPGs can be extremely social games, with high percentages of gamers making life-long friends and partners. It was concluded that virtual gaming may allow players to express themselves in ways they may not feel comfortable doing in real life because of their appearance, gender, sexuality, and/or age. MMORPGs also offer a place where teamwork, encouragement, and fun can be experienced.

In general, the user prescribes a sequence of motions one by one while providing an input trajectory. Since the input trajectory lacks in human characteristics, one may not synthesize quality motions by blindly following it. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven scheme for transforming a user-prescribed trajectory to a human trajectory in an on-line manner. As preprocessing, we analyze example motion data to extract human steering behavior. At run-time, the input trajectory is refined to reflect the steering behavior. Together with an existing on-line motion synthesis system, our scheme forms a feedback loop, in which the user effectively specifies an intended human trajectory.},

Objective: To gain insight into whether and to what extent, online games have the potential to contribute to student learning in higher education. Experimental setting: The online game was used for the first time during a lecture on Structural Concrete at Master{\textquoteright}s level, involving 121 seventh semester students. Methods: Pre-test/post-test experimental control group design with questionnaires and an independent online evaluation. Results: The minimum learning result of playing the game was equal to that achieved with traditional methods. A factor called "joy" was introduced, according to [Nielsen, J. (2002): User empowerment and the fun factor. In Jakob Nielsen{\textquoteright}s Alertbox, July 7, 2002. Available from http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020707.html.], which was amazingly high. Conclusion: The experimental findings support the efficacy of game playing. Students enjoyed this kind of e-learning.},

	abstract = {In areas such as Massively-Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), the conventional centralized server model does not scale with the sheer number of simultaneous clients that need to be supported. P2P architectures are increasingly being considered as replacements for traditional client-server architectures in MMOGs. A distributed P2P architecture that uses \&quot;Coordinator\&quot; nodes for handling smaller groups of players has been shown to be especially effective in supporting MMOGs. However, the drawback of moving from centralized to distributed architectures is the loss of control, and more specifically the increase in the vulnerability of the system as a whole to compromises. There has been no prior work on handling the specific case when the Coordinator itself is compromised and cheats, a scenario akin to cheating conducted by the network. We address this problem by proposing an architecture that is resilient to Coordinator compromises and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture. We believe that this is an essential step towards enabling a widespread deployment of P2P-based MMOGs.

They address wide-baseline scene reconstruction to provide 360-degree appearance from only eight camera views and introduce an efficient scene representation for level of detail control in streaming and rendering. Finally, they demonstrate interactive animation control in a computer games scenario using a captured library of human animation, achieving a frame rate of 300 fps on consumer level graphics hardware.},

Like-minded contemporaries R. Buckminster Fuller (World Game), Robert Smithson (Spiral Jetty), and Christo and Jean-Claude (Valley Curtain) responded in kind to these environmental and sociopolitical quandaries with their "earthworks." As digital game designers and theorists embark on developing new methods to address the creative crisis in mainstream game production, against a similar backdrop of global climate change, a controversial war, political upheaval, and complex gender issues, the authors propose a reexamination of the New Games movement and its methods as a means of constructing shared contexts for meaningful play in virtual and real-world spaces.},

A realistic human-like architecture is expected in a thematic computer game, since it strongly motivates the game players in an intuitive way. However, the task of building a human-like architecture is non-trivial since the construction is a real time process without human supervision. In this paper, we present a collective building algorithm inspired by social insects for intelligent construction based on multiple agents. A swarm of virtual agents indirectly design edifications, which resemble basic features in human-like architecture by using a stigmergic mechanism along with branching rules. The main idea of the algorithm is to map sensory information to appropriate building actions.

One friend played the game while the other observed; subsequently, both were asked to jointly tell a third party about their experience with the game. The resulting conversations were coded for narrative and other contributions, and discourse elements were examined in relation to pre- and postparticipation perceptions of expertise at the game. Players produced more narrative contributions than observers but only when observers had low self-perceived expertise prior to the game.

	abstract = {Emergent game formats, such as machinima, that use game worlds as expressive 3D performance spaces have new expressive powers with an increase of the quality of their underlying graphic and animation systems. Nevertheless, they still lack intuitive control mechanisms. Set direction and acting are limited by tools that were designed to create and play video games rather than produce expressive performance pieces. These tools do a poor job of capturing the performative expression that characterizes more mature media such as film. Tangible interfaces can help open up the game systems for more intuitive character control needed for a greater level of expression in the digital real-time world. The TUI3D project (Tangible User Interfaces for Real-Time 3D) addresses production and performative challenges involved in creating machinima through the development of tangible interfaces for controlling 3D virtual actors and environments in real-time. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a tangible puppet prototype for virtual character control in the Unreal game engine and discuss initial user feedback.

The ability to design nontrivial computer games that actually work has induced a consistently high level of sense of achievement among the students.

This study examined subjective time loss of 40 undergraduate students (26 males and 14 females with a mean age of 21.4 years) whilst playing one of two video games in an experimental setting. Mood state before and after game playing was also examined using the Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF, Grove \& Prapavessis, 1992). Results found that, females significantly underestimated the time that they were playing compared to males. Total Mood Disturbance increased after playing one of the games, but only for participants who reported that they would liked to have continued playing for longer. There were no gender differences in relation to mood state. It is concluded that time loss is not (in itself) a precipitating or facilitating factor relating to addictive behaviour patterns.},

Despite the novelty in audio only gaming, our approach builds on a foundation of several years of research into audio only applications for sight impaired users, augmented reality systems and human-computer interaction studies. In comparison to attempts to provide a realistic user interface, we argue a simple interface enhances both immersion and entertainment value, serendipitously making audio only games practical for mobile computing. Novel features of our system include real-time gameplay and multi-player support. We also describe our software architecture, the current implementation of which uses low-cost existing PC-based hardware and software. In addition, we describe our first game, Dragon{\textquoteright}s Roar.},

	abstract = {As virtual worlds and games grow in both personal and cultural importance, present limitations in access to them is increasingly limiting their ability to achieve their potential. Transmedial access, in which a given player\&$\#$39;s access to a game is made possible across different devices, offers a promising solution to this problem. It also inaugurates a new category of interaction design: transmedial interaction. This workshop explores the state of the art of transmedial interaction in games, which today unfortunately is often at most mere afterthought. It provides a participatory environment in which attendees can chart new paths forward, from developing viable business models and understanding the technical infrastructure to developing critical vocabularies and evaluative frameworks.

	abstract = {Objective: To assess developmental trends in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in British adolescents in relation to sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES).Design: A 5-year longitudinal study of a diverse cohort of students aged 11 - 12 years at baseline in 1999.Setting: 36 London schools sampled using a stratified random sampling procedure.Participants: A total of 5863 students categorised as white, black or Asian, and stratified for SES using the Townsend Index.Main outcome measures: Number of days per week of vigorous activity leading to sweating and breathing hard. Hours of sedentary behaviour, including watching television and playing video games. Data were analysed using multilevel, linear, mixed models.Results: Marked reductions in physical activity and increases in sedentary behaviour were noticed between ages 11 - 12 and 15 - 16 years. Boys were more active than girls, and the decline in physical activity was greater in girls (46\% reduction) than in boys (23\%). Asian students were less active than whites, and this was also true of black girls but not boys. Black students were more sedentary than white students. Levels of sedentary behaviour were greater in respondents from lower SES. Most differences between ethnic and SES groups were present at age 11 years, and did not evolve over the teenage years.Conclusions: Physical activity declines and sedentary behaviour becomes more common during adolescence. Ethnic and SES differences are observed in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in British youth that anticipate adult variations in adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk. These are largely established by age 11 - 12 years, so reversing these patterns requires earlier intervention.

	abstract = {Distributed virtual environments (DVEs) are distributed systems that allow multiple geographically distributed clients (users) to interact simultaneously in a computer-generated, shared virtual world. Applications of DVEs can be seen in many areas nowadays, such as online games, military simulations, collaborative designs, etc. To support large-scale DVEs with real-time interactions among thousands or even more distributed clients, a geographically distributed server architecture (GDSA) is generally needed, and the virtual world can be partitioned into many distinct zones to distribute the load among the servers. Due to the geographic distributions of clients and servers in such architectures, it is essential to efficiently assign the participating clients to servers to enhance users\&$\#$39; experience in interacting within the DVE. This problem is termed the client assignment problem (CAP) in this paper. We propose a two-phase approach, consisting of an initial assignment phase and a refined assignment phase to address the CAP. Both phases are shown to be NP-hard. Several heuristic assignment algorithms are then devised and evaluated via extensive simulations with realistic settings. We find that, even under heterogeneous environments like the Internet where accurate input data for the assignment algorithms are usually impractical to obtain, the proposed algorithms are still beneficial to the performances of DVE.

In an observational study of Second Life, a virtual community, we collected data from avatars in order to explore whether social norms of gender, interpersonal distance (IPD), and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments even though the modality of movement is entirely different (i.e., via keyboard and mouse as opposed to eyes and legs). Our results showed that established findings of IPD and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments: ( 1) male-male dyads have larger IPDs than female-female dyads, ( 2) male-male dyads maintain less eye contact than female-female dyads, and ( 3) decreases in IPD are compensated with gaze avoidance as predicted by the Equilibrium Theory. We discuss implications for users of online games as well as for social scientists who seek to conduct research in virtual environments.},

The results from this both theoretical and empirical analysis are quite clear. although the extensive use of violence-oriented computer games may in any case be described as uncontrolled, in the Aristotelian sense, it can, for the majority of the users, clearly not be defined as a lack of restraint with regard to violence because it is restricted to the virtual world. However, that minority of adolescents who make extensive use of violence-oriented computer games and whose thinking and acting shows great affinity to violence, may well be described as unbridled. The loss of control over violent actions among this group of the unbridled has-thus one of our central findings reached alarming proportions and a frightening quality.},

This study utilized ethnography to map out social interaction within the game World of Warcraft. It provides a broad framework of the factors affecting social interaction.

	abstract = {The use of electronic media is playing an ever greater role in adolescents\&$\#$39; recreational behaviour. From the point of view of the health sciences, one question which arises is the extent to which intensive media use is detrimental to physical activity and adolescents\&$\#$39; health development. The data from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), which were evaluated with a focus on 11-17-year-olds, confirm this heavy use of electronic media. However, there are distinct group-specific differences. For example, boys spend more time than girls on computers, the internet and games consoles, whereas girls more often listen to music and use their mobile phones. Watching television and videos is equally popular among girls and boys. Adolescents of low social status or a low level of school education use electronic media far more frequently and for longer times, especially television and video, games consoles and mobile phones. The same is true of boys and girls from the former states of the GDR and for boys (but not girls) with a background of migration. A connection to physical activity has been established for adolescents who spend more than five hours a day using electronic media. Moreover, this group of heavy users is more often affected by adiposity. The results of the KiGGS study, which are in line with earlier research findings, thus demonstrate that the use of electronic media is also of relevance from the point of view of public health and should be included in investigations into the health of children and adolescents.

Internal validity of data collected in VEs may be threatened due to a priori individual differences in general performance in VE navigation and in susceptibility to cybersickness. The main question was whether individual differences in performance can be diminished by means of training. Additionally, the susceptibility of different subsamples to cybersickness when rnoving within VEs was examined. 85 participants took part in an experiment where they had to fulfill simple tasks in three VEs. Navigation performance was measured as the time participants needed to make their way through the VEs. Differences in navigation performance between different levels of experience were diminished by training, indicating that internal validity can be obtained. A classification tree reveals that game-inexperienced female participants aged over 31 years have the highest risk of experiencing cybersickness. VEs based on modifications of computer games seem to be an extremely promising and inexpensive possibility for the administration of psychological experiments.},

Computer games can be highly complex software systems that involve the expertise of a wide range of professionals ranging from programmers to animators, artists and musicians.

In addition, the creative process could be benefited if game design ideas were capable of being shared widely and discussed.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate by way of an example the potential of a new approach called research profiling, and to raise discussion about the method{\textquoteright}s applicability in enriching traditional literature reviews. The specific topic of interest in this paper is digital games research as indexed in the ISI Web of Science. Altogether 2.136 articles were profiled. Almost half of the digital games research were classified either under computer science or psychology, or their subcategories. Only a small subset of the research was conducted from a business or management school perspective, which points to an obvious gap in the literature.

	note = {From the publisher{\textquoteright}s web site:

Violent video games are successfully marketed to and easily obtained by children and adolescents. Even the U.S. government distributes one such game, America{\textquoteright}s Army, through both the internet and its recruiting offices. Is there any scientific evidence to support the claims that violent games contribute to aggressive and violent behavior?

Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley first present an overview of empirical research on the effects of violent video games, and then add to this literature three new studies that fill the most important gaps. They update the traditional General Aggression Model to focus on both developmental processes and how media-violence exposure can increase the likelihood of aggressive and violent behavior in both short- and long-term contexts. Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents also reviews the history of these games{\textquoteright} explosive growth, and explores the public policy options for controlling their distribution. Anderson et al. describe the reaction of the games industry to scientific findings that exposure to violent video games and other forms of media violence constitutes a significant risk factor for later aggressive and violent behavior. They argue that society should begin a more productive debate about whether to reduce the high rates of exposure to media violence, and delineate the public policy options that are likely be most effective.

As the first book to unite empirical research on and public policy options for violent video games, Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents will be an invaluable resource for student and professional researchers in social and developmental psychology and media studies.},

Typically, happy faces are identified faster than angry faces (the happy-face advantage). Results indicated that playing a violent video game led to a reduction in the happy face advantage. Implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the current models of aggressive behavior.

In Study 1, the authors found that the frequency of playing racing games was positively associated with competitive driving, obtrusive driving, and car accidents; a negative association with cautious driving was observed. To determine cause and effect, in Study 2, the authors manipulated whether participants played I of 3 racing games or I of 3 neutral games. Participants who played a racing game subsequently reported a higher accessibility of cognitions and affect positively associated with risk taking than did participants who played a neutral game. Finally, on a more behavioral level, in Study 3, the authors found that men who played a racing game subsequently took higher risks in computer-simulated critical road traffic situations than did men who played a neutral game.

Later Ray Oldenburg [The Great Good Place. New York: Marlowe \& Company (1989)] extended Simmel{\textquoteright}s work by focusing on a certain class of public settings, or "third places," in which sociability tends to occur, such as, bars, coffee shops, general stores, etc. But while Simmel and Oldenburg describe activities and public spaces in the physical world, their concepts may apply as well to virtual or online worlds. Today Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are extensive, persistent online 3D environments that are populated by hundreds of thousands of players at any given moment. The sociable nature of these online spaces is often used to explain their success: unlike previous video games, MMOGs require players to exchange information and collaborate in real-time to progress in the game. In order to shed light on this issue, we critically examine player-to-player interactions in a popular MMOG (Star Wars Galaxies). Based on several months of ethnographic observations and computerized data collection, we use Oldenburg{\textquoteright}s notion of "third places" to evaluate whether or not the social spaces of this virtual world fit existing definitions of sociable environments. We discuss the role online games can play in the formation and maintenance of social capital, what they can teach us about the evolution of sociability in an increasingly digitally connected social world, and what could be done to make such games better social spaces.},

For power gamers, technology and gender are most highly integrated. These women enjoy multiple pleasures from the gaming experience, including mastery of game-based skills and competition. Moderate gamers play games in order to cope with their real lives. These women reported taking pleasure in controlling the gaming environment, or alternately that games provide a needed distraction from the pressures of their daily lives. Finally, the non-gamers who participated in the study expressed strong criticisms about game-playing and gaming culture. For these women, games are a waste of time, a limited commodity better spent on other activities.

We then develop an extended version of this protocol, called asynchronous synchronization, which avoids the penalty, is serverless, offers provable anti-cheating guarantees, is robust in the presence of packet loss, and provides for significantly increased communication performance. This technique is applicable to common game features as well as clustering and cell-based techniques for massively multiplayer games. Specifically, we provide a zero-knowledge proof protocol so that players are within a specific range of each other, and otherwise have no notion of their distance. Our performance claims are backed by analysis using a simulation based on real game traces.},

One advancement in computer games are interactive games that use physical activity as a game playing controller, combining exercise and entertainment, or exertainment. Purpose: This study tested the reinforcing value and activity levels of interactive dance and bicycle race games in 18 overweight and 17 non-overweight 8- to 12-year-old youth. Methods: Reinforcing value was studied using a behavioral choice paradigm that provided children the opportunity to respond on progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement for a choice of either playing the video dance or bicycle game using a handheld video game controller or one of three options: dancing or bicycling alone, dancing or bicycling while watching a video, or playing the interactive dance or bicycle game. Reinforcing value was defined in relationship to the amount of responding children engaged in for either choice. Results: Results showed the interactive dance game was more reinforcing than dancing alone or dancing while watching the video (p = .003), but there was no difference across bicycling conditions. Nonoverweight youth were more active when given the opportunity to play the interactive dance game than overweight children (p = .05). Conclusions: These results suggest that children may be motivated to be active when given the opportunity to play an interactive dance game.},

However, it is claimed that digital games can be a promising educational tool utilizing both the attributes that make them effective in the learning process and the students{\textquoteright} predisposition to deal with them. The present study explores the background of digital game use in a group of Greek adolescents (N=125) (12 to 16 years old) and the potential of using digital games as an educational tool, on a socio-cognitive learning theory basis. Gender differences were revealed; concerning the time spent playing digital games, the game preferences, and the identification with the hero of the game. There was no correlation of frequent digital game use with low academic performance, though frequent game use was partially correlated with low Self-esteem and high Computer Self-efficacy.},

Of these 50, 20 participated in qualitative online interviews; their answers allow a better under{\textlnot}standing of the quantitative data. The main results of the quantitative survey are that most of the players gained new relationships {\textendash} in{\textlnot}cluding an amazingly high number of couples {\textendash} and only one player lost a friend; nevertheless nearly half of the players had neglected their RL relationships for some time. The interviewees judged these effects according to their RL experiences: Highest ratings were re-ported by those who gained closer relationships in VR than they were used to in RL {\textendash} even though this might mean that they had simply found acquaintances rather than real friends.},

This paper addresses two design questions: 1) How to transform a popular game into an educational game? 2) How to design multi-level challenges to sustain fun for practicing arithmetic in that game? In this paper, the game rules of Bingo are modified to design a competitive computer game, called EduBingo, for practicing arithmetic in a classroom. Based on our previous works and surveys of several digital games, four dimensions of challenges are identified for devising such educational games. A trail test was conducted to preliminarily evaluate the game{\textquoteright}s effects on learning, and, in particular, the influences of different dimensions of challenges on practice.},

Purpose: This study assessed the relationship between leisure-based screen time and physical activity in families to determine whether assignment to a limited screen time group results in more physical activity. Methods: Ninety-four families participated for six weeks. Families were randomly assigned to unlimited or limited screen time viewing groups. Participants wore a pedometer to measure steps. Results: Results indicate no statistically significant differences in steps for adults (F(1,165)=0.81, p?.369) or 13-to-18-year-olds (F(1,63)=0.21, p?.647). Among the 5-to-12-year-olds, statistically significant group differences (F(1,165)=5.63, p?.019) for steps were found between the unlimited viewing group and the limited viewing groups. Discussion: Lower amounts of leisure-based screen time yielded increased amounts of physical activity in the 5-to-12-year-olds, but this trend was not found in the 13-to-18-year-olds or adults. Additional research is needed in order to more fully understand the screen time and physical activity relationship. Translation to Health Education Practice: In general, promotion of physical activity at home and school could increase physical activity and decrease leisure-based screen time; otherwise, other sedentary activities may only replace the time not spent in front of a screen.},

Online games and virtual environments, like World of Warcraft and Second Life, offer inhabitants emotionally compelling experiences connected to spirituality and the supernatural. The methods employed here emphasize qualitative approaches, but connect them to quantitative approaches as well. Methods like these can be useful to study a variety of religion-related topics online. Electronic games are an especially good example to illustrate these methods because they, like the World Wide Web itself, are a commercially successful vanguard of the new technologies that may be transforming human culture.},

Here EVE? is developed for the case of gambling games, specifically slot machines, deriving a Bayesian-information measure of aesthetic utility that is not modeled by the economic utility of previous proposals like Prospect Theory. The derivation shows how aesthetic utility can be measured by entropy and how fun can be seen as a form of learning.

A sample comprising of 7069 gamers answered two questionnaires online. Data revealed that 11.9\% of participants (840 gamers) fulfilled diagnostic criteria of addiction concerning their gaming behavior, while there is only weak evidence for the assumption that aggressive behavior is interrelated with excessive gaming in general. Results of this study contribute to the assumption that also playing games without monetary reward meets criteria of addiction.

This is ineffective and meaningless due to the fact that students should be learning knowledge via the cognizance process. Computer games are merely a platform, a channel, and a tool. We should address and focus on the cognizance process. Computer games are an experience-based media which feasibly constructs player (student) knowledge through game playing.

As expected, the most aggressive participants were those who played a violent game and wished they were like a violent character in the game. These participants used noise levels loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage to their partners, even though their partners had not provoked them.

	abstract = {War games often try to simulate the characteristics of real weapons - their range, loading times and the bullets{\textquoteright} caliber in order to create an authentic image of war. What they do not show is its authentic violence. Usually we do not see blood pixels and splatter orgies as in dungeon games in which the player has to fight monsters and zombies with eg. magic swords. Instead pictures of a clean war are presented in which civilians hardly ever appear and every weapon hits the target remote-controlled. Because of the simulation{\textquoteright}s naturalism gamers may believe that a genuine war looks like the one the screen - and, in fact, today{\textquoteright}s soldiers are not faced with the {\textquoteleft}white in the eye of the enemy{\textquoteright} any longer what they do see are symbols on the radar or abstract objects on a computer screen.Accordingly, the real war more and more looks like a computer game while the computer game increasingly looks like reality.Among the currently most popular war game genres are World War 2 games. They met their renaissance with the 1998 release of Stephen Spielberg{\textquoteright}s Hollywood movie {\textquotedblleft}Saving Private Ryan{\textquotedblright}. The film starts with an impressive staging of the battle following the landing at Omaha Beach in 1944 and subsequently a number of WW2 games were published in which gamers could re-enact the battle over and over on the internet. The respective gamers are organised in so called clans which often refer to historical divisions of Allied forces or German troops. Some of them even play under the names of well-known SS divisions such as {\textquotedblleft}Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler{\textquotedblright}.Most of the other gamers in this community do not seem to object to SS-clans who argue that they were only re-enacting their idols{\textquoteright} campaigns and did not share their biologist and racist world view. Thus, they try to promote the image of the bravely fighting SS-soldier in disregard of the war crimes committed by the Waffen-SS. Such arguments resemble the patterns used in speeches of the German Neo-Nazi party NPD.In my article, I will analyse popular war games and the way they try to advance the image of the brave soldier and a intriguing weapon technology while neglecting the effects of violence and atrocities and how these games do not appear in the daily discussion about violence and are mostly elided by the protection of minors.},

	booktitle = {GLOBECOM - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference},
	year = {2007},
	abstract = {We propose a gaming architecture, called the Overlay Server System (OSS), for supporting multiparty online games over mobile networks. In OSS architecture, overlay server nodes (OSN) are distributed across the core network architecture of the mobile operator and each node is responsible for both running the game applications and performing the overlay routing. The architecture allows third party game servers that are located outside the core network of the mobile operator to push the execution of delay and bandwidth constrained game components into the core to achieve better quality of service (QoS). When a game consists of multiple mutually exclusive game objects such that each object can be maintained independently, OSS allows per object QoS optimization via selecting the jointly optimal location (i.e. OSN) and overlay routes for each object. This fine-grain optimization benefits most when different objects have different QoS requirements and they are accessed by different users. OSS dynamically adapts to the changes in game and network conditions by switching to better OSN and overlay routes. Our performance analysis on different core network topologies and usage patterns demonstrates that OSS has significant advantages over the alternative peer to peer (P2P), proxy-server, and client-server architectures. The analysis also underlines the individual contributions of object placement and jointly performed overlay route optimization to the performance gain.},

	abstract = {The Ludic Society manifesto briefly introduces several ideas around the named international association of game researchers and practitioners. The Neo-?pataphysical conceptions allows new formats for the investigation of digital games as cultural phenomenon and artistic practice. The ludic field covers topics of Real Play and uselessness in techno Toy objects. In the nascent discipline Ludics an investigator of games applies poetic practices of games and play as method of research. The research field of Ludics introduces the notion of {\textquotedblleft}Real Players{\textquotedblright}, who are gaming inside the best game engine we know, the {\textquotedblleft}Reality Engine{\textquotedblright}. The ludic researcher emerges as penseuse maudite, as wicked severe thinker, a bon mot which Deleuze originally had attributed to Nietzsche (1965). This discourse-theoretical framing drives towards Nietzsche{\textquoteright}s vibrant dictum of a {\textquotedblright}gay science,{\textquotedblright} in playful formats as aphorisms and poetry (transferred out of the sphere of computer games into real life), in setups which I call Real Playing, which is distinct from Real Gaming, which normally addresses the phenomenon of incorporating computer games in real life. The Real Play highlights a certain social life and, as a mediated art, employs a game with a Real Gamer constraint, a bondage as its own rules of play. The willing acceptance of this constraint is not a limitation, but an intentionally chosen poetic rule of play in Ludics or in German{\textasciiacute}Ludistik{\textasciiacute} (Jahrmann, 2005).},

In this position paper, we draw on literature from anthropology, sociology, and film to challenge long-standing misconceptions of "games" and "work" and of "virtuality" and "reality" as dualisms that have obscured synthetic worlds from serious consideration by IS scholars. Building on this work and recent reports of businesses, nonprofits, entrepreneurs, and educational institutions incorporating synthetic worlds into their day-to-day practices, we argue that synthetic worlds represent a legitimate arena for IS research. We begin by offering a framework for characterizing the nature and structure of the social activity occurring in the diverse array of synthetic worlds currently available. Then we illustrate our position by considering synthetic worlds from the perspective of organizational communication, a substantive area with a rich tradition in IS research. Employing a genre lens as an illustrative example, we identify phenomena and raise research questions the IS community is uniquely positioned to explore.},

Design: Nonexperimental study. Setting: Survey data collected during the 2002-2003 school year. Participants: A nationally representative sample of 1491 children aged 10 to 19 years. Main Outcome Measure: Twenty-four-hour timeuse diaries were collected on 1 weekday and 1 weekend day, both randomly chosen. Time-use diaries were used to determine adolescents{\textquoteright} time spent playing video games, with parents and friends, reading and doing homework, and in sports and active leisure. Results: Differences in time spent between game players and nonplayers as well as the magnitude of the relationships among game time and activity time among adolescent game players were assessed. Thirty-six percent of adolescents (80\% of boys and 20\% of girls) played video games. On average, gamers played for an hour on the weekdays and an hour and a half on the weekends. Compared with nongamers, adolescent gamers spent 30\% less time reading and 34\% less time doing homework. Among gamers (both genders), time spent playing video games without parents or friends was negatively related to time spent with parents and friends in other activities. Conclusions: Although gamers and nongamers did not differ in the amount of time they spent interacting with family and friends, concerns regarding gamers{\textquoteright} neglect of school responsibilities (reading and homework) are warranted. Although only a small percentage of girls played video games, our findings suggest that playing video games may have different social implications for girls than for boys.},

Ever since flight schools used simulation as a method for training pilots, the value of simulated activity has overlapped with the necessity of functional training. In contrast to its stereotype as stodgy and out-of-touch, the military embraced game-based simulations earlier than other institutions, according to gaming industry observers. The effectiveness of games in training and delivering content lies at the heart of what is called the "serious games" movement, which is led by advocates who believe that games can be effective training tools. A Serious Games summit was recently held in the Washington, DC, area to showcase many of the game elements that are being used to train the military and other professionals. While some fear gaming in the school or workplace, many games already play an educational role. One could argue that the increasing sophistication and the multiplicity of scenarios used in games are becoming more like a simulated environment and less like a game played merely for escape.},

The amount of time a student spends playing video games has a negative correlation with students{\textquoteright} GPA and SAT scores. As video game usage increases, GPA and SAT scores decrease. A chi-squared analysis found a p value for video game usage and GPA was greater than a 95\% confidence level (0.005 < p < 0.01). This finding suggests that dependence exists. SAT score and video game usage also returned a p value that was significant (0.01 < p < 0.05).

This research suggests that video games may have a detrimental effect on an individual{\textquoteright}s GPA and possibly on SAT scores. Although these results show statistical dependence, proving cause and effect remains difficult, since SAT scores represent a single test on a given day. The effects of video games maybe be cumulative; however, drawing a conclusion is difficult because SAT scores represent a measure of general knowledge. GPA versus video games is more reliable because both involve a continuous measurement of engaged activity and performance. The connection remains difficult because of the complex nature of student life and academic performance.

Instead of interfacing the game to an exercise bike or other equipment with speed output, the skiing speed is directly proportional to heart rate. You can freely choose the form of physical exercise, which makes it easier for people with different skill levels and backgrounds to play together. The system can be used with any exercise machine or form. To make playing meaningful instead of simply exercising as hard as you can, a high heart rate impedes the shooting part of the game by making the sight less steady. This balancing mechanism lets the player try out different tactics, varying from very slow skiing and sharp shooting to fast skiing and random shooting. The game has been evaluated in a user study with eight participants. The results show that heart rate interaction is fun and usable interaction method.},

Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and the network analyses of Manuel Castells, the paper reconstructs the forces shaping players{\textquoteright} stylistic decisions through an analysis of dance game machines and software, and of a single forum thread on DDRFreak.com, a major website in the dance game community. The paper asks who decides how DDR players dance and at what times? Are the decisions about play made in the development meeting, the arcade, competitions, online or around the home console? Globally, how do some regions or groups emerge as experts or leaders in play style? Analysis indicates that within the United States, Californian players from major cities dominate discussion, supported by the global flows of people, resources, and capital through the state. The dominant players support their stated norms for play through recourse to mainstream conceptions of masculinity, rap music and associated styles of dance.},

	month = {10/2006},
	abstract = {This paper is based on ongoing research into the gendered use of mobile convergent media in the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, what role does the cute have and how does it correlate with types of consumption? As a region, the Asia-Pacific is marked by diverse penetration rates, subject to local cultural and socio-economic nuances. Two defining locations - Seoul (South Korea) and Tokyo (Japan) - are seen as both  mobile centres and gaming centres which the world looks towards as examples of the future-in-the-present. Unlike Japan, which pioneered the keitai (mobile) IT revolution with devices such as i-mode, South Korea has become a centre for mobile DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadband) with the successful implementation of TV mobile phones (TU mobile) in 2005. One of the key features of mobile media technologies is the attempt by the industry to find the next killer application . One such application is the possibility of online multiplayer games accessed through mobile (broadband) telephonic devices such as MMO golf RPG Shot Online (a golf game for mobile phones). Amongst this frenzy of trend spotting and stargazing, Seoul as a mobile broadband and gaming centre provides a curious case study for the social and cultural intricacies informing the rise of gaming as an everyday practice for many Koreans.
This article begins by outlining the game play and technoculture particular to South Korea and then explores the phenomenon of Kart Rider in South Korean gaming cultures - and its perception/ reception outside Korea - to sketch some of the issues at stake in playing it cute (particularly in the form of cute avatars), consuming Korea and the endurance of co-present communities. In particular, it contemplates the implications of current emerging online mobile gaming genres such as so-called female games such as the cute{\textquoteright} Kart Rider in order to think about changing modes of game play and attendant social spaces.},

In this paper, we begin by discussing some of the statistics that reveal electronic gaming{\textquoteright}s place as a major force in today{\textquoteright}s economy. We next discuss two of the major problems involved with the usage of video games as a tool for teaching and learning in digital media: the issues of inconsistency and complexity. Gee{\textquoteright}s pioneering work (2004) is used to establish some principles of gaming that transcend these problems and present a unique medium with which to examine the nature of digital media and its principles and tools. We expand upon Gee{\textquoteright}s work to suggest specific ways that video games can be used to teach digital media students about a particular subset of digital media {\textendash} in this case, that of project management, and speculate as to how this might be done in several genres of gaming. We conclude with a brief case study of our experiences in working with digital media students to build a video game that was used to teach fourth graders about African-American history and the Underground Railroad.

Interactive Narrative is an approach to interactive entertainment that enables the player to make decisions that directly affect the direction and/or outcome of the narrative experience being delivered by the computer system. Interactive narrative requires two seemingly conflicting requirements: coherent narrative and user agency. We present an interactive narrative system that uses a combination of narrative control and autonomous believable character agents to augment a story world simulation in which the user has a high degree of agency with narrative plot control. A drama manager called the Automated Story Director gives plot-based guidance to believable agents. The believable agents are endowed with the autonomy necessary to carry out directives in the most believable fashion possible. Agents also handle interaction with the user. When the user performs actions that change the world in such a way that the Automated Story Director can no longer drive the intended narrative forward, it is able to adapt the plot to incorporate the user\&$\#$39;s changes and still achieve dramatic goals.

	abstract = {The current buzz-word in the e-Learning community is game-based learning or serious games{\textendash}games whose primary focus is education not entertainment. Until recently, much e-Learning consisted of page-turner lessons created in an attempt to fill the growing demand for online courses. However, e-Learning is moving beyond merely digitizing traditional classroom course content for online accessibility. These serious games are becoming the new
model for e-Learning. A good game, including a serious game, consists of a story, a clear goal, a significant yet not impossible challenge,
meaningful actions, and appropriate feedback all rolled up in an attention-getting package. A challenge for
instructional designers in creating these serious games is changing our mindset from the traditional presentation of the lesson followed by testing to assess student comprehension. These lessons are typically in text format followed by a multiple choice test. Even when we try to jazz it up with graphics and interactivity, it is still the same old thing. In creating games, we need to move away from putting text on a screen to creating engaging learning experiences. So, how do we make the transition from instructional designers to serious game designers? What do instructional
designers need to do differently? This paper describes the challenges and lessons learned in designing two game-based courses for the U.S. Army.
We{\textquoteright}ve had to adapt everything from storyboarding to the changing roles of the development team members. instructional designers need to know how games work and how to keep the educational objective from being obscured by the entertainment and glitz of the game.},

Since the launch of Pong in the 1970s, computer and videogames have grown into a $30 billion worldwide industry. Between 2000 and 2004 the UK\&$\#$39;s consumption of videogame products and activities grew by over {\textsterling}15 billion, with the recent successful UK and US launches of Microsoft  Xbox 360 and Sonyj Playstation Portable (PSP) not yet included in those figures. In recent years there has been an upsurge in the number of researchers stdyinggaming. Topics have inclzlded investigations of the reasons why people play videogames, the potential of games in educational settings, and the efects which these games, and the culture which surround them, may be having on society. As videogame phying becomes more widespread and increasing numbers of videogame playing students enter higher education, educational research into the impact of extensive videogame playing on student approaches to learning and attitudes toward higher education is vital. The chapter begins by presenting an introduction to the culture of videogames and continues with a discussion on the relevant literature in this research area. An overview of our research project currently being carried out in the School of Education at the University of Edinburgh in the UK will be provided. The project is seeking to explore the experience of videogame play among students in higher education, and to identify the differences which might exist between gamers and non-gamers in their approaches to learning and study, and in their attitudes toward higher education. Finally, key results of our project will be presented and discussed in the context of current research.

	abstract = {Online learning in commercial computer games allows computer-controlled opponents to adapt to the way the game is being played. As such it provides a mechanism to deal with weaknesses in the game AI, and to respond to changes in human player tactics. We argue that online learning of game AI should meet four computational and four functional requirements. The computational requirements are speed, effectiveness, robustness and efficiency. The functional requirements are clarity, variety, consistency and scalability. This paper investigates a novel online learning technique for game AI called {\textquoteright}dynamic scripting{\textquoteright}, that uses an adaptive rulebase for the generation of game AI on the fly. The performance of dynamic scripting is evaluated in experiments in which adaptive agents are pitted against a collection of manually-designed tactics in a simulated computer roleplaying game. Experimental results indicate that dynamic scripting succeeds in endowing computer-controlled opponents with adaptive performance. To further improve the dynamic-scripting technique, an enhancement is investigated that allows scaling of the difficulty level of the game AI to the human player{\textquoteright}s skill level. With the enhancement, dynamic scripting meets all computational and functional requirements. The applicability of dynamic scripting in state-of-the-art commercial games is demonstrated by implementing the technique in the game NEVERWINTER NIGHTS. We conclude that dynamic scripting can be successfully applied to the online adaptation of game AI in commercial computer games.},

At the same time, computer game research and development has increasingly drawn on technologies and techniques originally developed in the large scale distributed simulation community, such as the HLA IEEE standard for simulator interoperability. In this paper, we address a central issue for HLA-based games, namely the development of HLA-compliant game agents. We present HLA _ AGENT, an HLA-compliant version of the SIM_AGENT toolkit for building cognitively rich agents. We outline the changes necessary to the SIM _ AGENT toolkit to allow integration with the HLA, and show that, given certain reasonable assumptions, all necessary code can be generated automatically from the FOM and the object class publications and subscriptions. The integration is transparent in the sense that the existing SIM_AGENT code runs unmodified and the agents are unaware that other parts of the system are running remotely. We present some preliminary performance results, which indicate that the overhead introduced by the HLA extension is modest even for lightweight agents with limited computational requirements. },

Consistent with predictions flowing from Social Information Processing Theory, the vast majority of messages were socioemotional and positively valenced, despite the ostensible game objective of fighting other participants. Experience level played an important role in message production. More experienced participants produced both more positive and fewer negative socioemotional messages than the less experienced and used more specialized language conventions (e.g., emoticons, scripted emotes, and abbreviations).

Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) is one of the solutions, but in cases of severe aliasing it can only mask the aliasing by unnaturally blurring. In this paper we present two improved antialiased shadow algorithms based on PCF, named as Modified PCF I and Modified PCF II. The primary idea of our algorithms is to make sawtooth shadow edges straighter just by data modification before bilinear interpolation in PCF. We respectively implement the algorithms with graphic hardware in Pixel Shader 2.0 and 3.0, several examples are also provided to show that most of aliasing artifacts have been removed compared with PCF.

	abstract = {MMOG are very large distributed applications, sharing very large states, and supporting communication between potentially thousands of player nodes. Despite the development of many solutions to define suitable architecture and communication protocol, and enabling efficient deployment of these types of applications, many issues remains which still require a solution. In this paper we discuss MMOG deployed over a Peer-to-Peer architecture, supporting a distributed model of systems with shared state and we address issues related to scalability, interest management and communication. We identify an efficient partitioning and distribution of the shared state as an important aspect in such models and propose a hierarchical multi-level interest management algorithm which enables contextual communication between peers. Experiments have been carried out and show the performance of the approach.

Participants were 299 adolescent boys from lower and higher secondary schools in the Netherlands and Belgium. In general, boys were most attracted to violent video games. Boys that scored higher in trait aggressiveness and lower in empathy were especially attracted to violent games and spent more time playing video games than did boys lower in trait aggressiveness. Lower educated boys showed more appreciation for both violent and nonviolent games and spent more time playing them than did higher educated boys. The present study showed that aggressive and less empathic boys were most attracted to violent games. The fact that heavy users of violent games show less empathy and higher aggressiveness suggests the possibility of desensitization. Other studies have shown that playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy. These results combined suggest the possibility of a violence cycle. Aggressive individuals are attracted to violent games. Playing violent games increases aggressiveness and decreases empathy, which in turn leads to increased appreciation and use of violent games.},

Linear providers will be regulated according to a revised broadcast regime, and will encompass both traditional broadcasters and providers of Internet Protocol TV (IPTV). This regime will apply whether the viewer watches the programme in real-time or records (using, for instance, a Personal Video Recorder; PVR) for later playback. Where the viewer actively requests the individual video file on demand, this is considered a non-linear use of video. This latter type of service would be regulated according to minimal standards, lighter than linear {\textquoteleft}broadcasting{\textquoteright} regulation, but still encompassing a wide range of prohibitions against particular types and durations of advertising, other commercial communications, different types of expression, and so on. The definitions do not exclude video blogs, interactive computer games or delivery of video over mobile telephone networks.},

The system is fully automated and can quickly map a complete digital environment without the need for human intervention. Arbitrary complex polygonal worlds can be processed within a few minutes on today{\textquoteright}s computers. The processed information allows a robot with a limited number of degrees of freedom to efficiently navigate around obstacles and find routes through the environment. The system is especially suitable for route finding and navigation through buildings which are typically designed with the use of computers these days. As such, digital polygonal representations of buildings are readily available. Not only can the system be used for robot navigation, it can also be used to guide people through buildings. Being able to quickly compile an arbitrary building into a route and path finding system can be especially useful for firemen and tactical military units to invade buildings and reach specific locations. When a building is partly destroyed or inaccessible for other reasons, the digital representation of the building can easily be adjusted by adding or removing polygons and the system presented here can be used to quickly recalculate routes. The system has been successfully implemented and employed in the popular computer game Quake III Arena. The artificial players in this game use the system for path and route finding through complex 31) polygonal worlds. Many other computer games can also benefit from the system presented here.},

Adaptive game AI can improve the entertainment value of games by allowing computer-controlled opponents to fix weaknesses automatically in the game AI and to respond to changes in human-player tactics. Dynamic scripting is a reinforcement learning approach to adaptive game AI that learns, during gameplay, which game tactics an opponent should select to play effectively. In previous work, the tactics used by dynamic scripting were designed manually. We introduce the evolutionary state-based tactics generator (ESTG), which uses an evolutionary algorithm to generate tactics automatically. Experimental results show that ESTG improves dynamic scripting{\textquoteright}s performance in a realtime strategy game. We conclude that high-quality domain knowledge can be automatically generated for strong adaptive game AI opponents. Game developers can benefit from applying ESTG, as it considerably reduces the time and effort needed to create adaptive game AI.},

The prototype is designed to provide, what we refer to as a believable environment. We sug-gest four design characteristics to provide a persuasive inclusion of a journey into a pervasive game. First, the story should refer to geographical objects with their everyday meaning. Second, the game needs to scale over vast areas. Third, the application should provide sequential storytelling to make it fit with the journey ex-perience, and finally it should provide interaction support where players can engage in gameplay and interact with the computer in various ways at the same time as they are looking out of the car window. We describe how these requirements have been imple-mented in the prototype and present an initial performance test.

It provides a rationale for players{\textquoteright} actions, as well as the logic that under- pins the stylistic profile of the game, its objects, tasks, and characters. In terms of the "cultural" environments of the game, the presence of a coherent and extensive myth scheme is core to the way differences and conflicts between races are organized. And, as a form of intertextual resonance, its mythology furnishes the game with a "thickness" of meaning that promotes, for players, a sense of mythological being as well as encouraging an in-depth textual engagement.},

Identifying risk factors early in life can facilitate use of preventive strategies to reduce risk and improve health status across the life span. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify modifiable (tobacco smoke exposure, physical inactivity, dietary fat intake, overweight, and high blood pressure ) and nonmodifiable (family history, gender, and age) cardiovascular risk factors in low-income preschool children. Methods: Low-income preschool children (N = 205) 3-5 years old were recruited to participate. Parents completed a multigene rational cardiovascular health history form and a 24-hour dietary recall for themselves and their child. The children{\textquoteright}s height, weight, and BP were obtained. Results: Of the 205 children, 61\% reported ethnicity as Latino or Hispanic, 31.7\% non-Hispanic White, 1\% non-Hispanic Black, 3.9\% Asian, and 2.4\% mixed race. The number of males (50.7\%) and females (49.3\%) was similar. Only 22 (10.7\%) children had no identified cardiovascular risk factors. At least one modifiable risk factor was present in 179 (87.3\%) children. Fifty-two (25.5\%) children had a body mass index (BMI) >= 85th percentile for gender and age; 44 (22.3\%) had a systolic or diastolic BP over the 90th percentile for gender, age, and height; 128 (66.3\%) had a dietary fat intake of > 30\%; 77 (37.6\%) watched TV or played video games more than 2 hr/day; and 48 (23.4\%) were exposed to passive tobacco smoke. Discussion: The identification of cardiovascular risk factors in almost 90\% of presumably healthy preschoolers provides evidence to support testing of interventions that can improve health behaviors and reduce risks.},

One theory posits that repeated exposure to media violence desensitizes viewers to real world violence, increasing aggression by blunting aversive reactions to violence and removing normal inhibitions against aggression. Theoretically, violence desensitization should be reflected in the amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), which has been associated with activation of the aversive motivational system. In the current study, violent images elicited reduced P300 amplitudes among violent, as compared to nonviolent video game players. Additionally, this reduced brain response predicted increased aggressive behavior in a later task. Moreover, these effects held after controlling for individual differences in trait aggressiveness. These data are the first to link media violence exposure and aggressive behavior to brain processes hypothetically associated with desensitization. },

online games (MMOGs); however, by their nature, these games are difficult to investigate. Game play is
often complex and the underlying mechanisms are frequently opaque. In contrast, board games are simple.
Their game play is fairly constrained and their core mechanisms are transparent enough to analyze. In this
article, the authors seek to understand collaborative games. Because of their simplicity, they focus on board
games. The authors present an analysis of collaborative games. In particular, they focus on Reiner Knizia{\textquoteright}s
LORDOFTHERINGS, considered by many to be the quintessential collaborative board game. Our analysis
yields seven observations, four lessons, and three pitfalls, that game designers might consider useful for
designing collaborative games. They reflect on the particular opportunities that computers have for the

An intersection of these two domains--what the author calls comparative video game criticism--suggests a more intimate interrelation between criticism and production. The author offers a critique of functionalist approaches to video game analysis and argues instead for a comparative analysis of the expressive capacity of games and how they relate to other forms of human production.},

On top of Pegasus we have created a language for describing pervasive games called DHG and briefly present a first sample application that is based on the component based architecture and defined with the game description language DHG.

The particularities of the video game industry and culture can be recognized in the transnational corporations that contribute to its formation and development; in the global audience for its products; and in the complex mixing of format, style and content within games. As an exemplar of this process, the Japanese game publisher Square Enix is the focus of this case study, as it has been successful in contributing to global culture as well as to the digital games industry through its glocal methods. That achievement by a non-Western corporation is indicative of the hybridization of the digital games industry, and it is examined here as one indicator of the complexities and challenges, as well as future potentials, of global media culture.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To quantify the depiction of violence, blood, sexual themes, profanity, substances, and gambling in video games rated M (for "mature") and to measure agreement between the content observed and the rating information provided to consumers on the game box by the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Design: We created a database of M-rated video game titles, selected a random sample, recorded at least 1 hour of game play, quantitatively assessed the content, performed statistical analyses to describe the content, and compared our observations with the Entertainment Software Rating Board content descriptors and results of our prior studies. Setting: Harvard University, Boston, Mass. Participants: Authors and 1 hired game player. Main Exposure: M-rated video games. Main Outcome Measures: Percentages of game play depicting violence, blood, sexual themes, gambling, alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs; use of profanity in dialogue, song lyrics, or gestures. Results: Although the Entertainment Software Rating Board content descriptors for violence and blood provide a good indication of such content in the game, we identified 45 observations of content that could warrant a content descriptor in 29 games (81\%) that lacked these content descriptors. M-rated video games are significantly more likely to contain blood, profanity, and substances; depict more severe injuries to human and non-human characters; and have a higher rate of human deaths than video games rated T (for "teen"). Conclusion: Parents and physicians should recognize that popular M-rated video games contain a wide range of unlabeled content and may expose children and adolescents to messages that may negatively influence their perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.},

In an attempt to address some of the open issues, we present two novel approaches. The first approach uses branch-based software watermarking to discourage and detect piracy through a registration-based system. in the second approach, based on the parallels between games and premium audio and video content, we propose the use of current physical-media copy-protection technologies for gaming content. In particular, we focus on broadcast encryption technology. The use of an open, standard-based architecture enables the development of a more restrictive protection system for games. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed protection mechanisms can be applied to video-game copy protection through five scenarios.},

Overall, when the blood manipulation was on, participants perceived greater gore. Players were significantly more focused when they played in the third-person point of view than when they played in first person. Males were more involved in the game overall regardless of point of view, but females were more focused and involved when they played in third, not first, person. In addition, we wanted to see if game manipulations and perceptions of the game affected aggressive outcomes. Those who played the game in the blood-on condition had more physically aggressive intentions, and when players were more involved and immersed in the game, they reported greater hostility and physically aggressive intentions. Findings are discussed as they relate to mental models Of media violence.},

Sport-related games continue to be one of the most popular forms of digital gaming, and the series has proved to be one of the most successful of all time. Drawing on 32 interviews with game players and developers of this series, this paper argues that this series has proved particularly popular due to its \&$\#$39;intertextual\&$\#$39; links to the sport of football, which allows this game to be drawn on as a resource in conversations and social networks. In particular, this paper argues that aspects of gaming, such as performativity and control, extend and cross-cut with wider social formations. Hence, the author argues that it is crucial that considerations of digital games seek to locate these within wider social and cultural patterns.

An exploratory factor analysis revealed a five factor model of user motivations-Achievement, Relationship, Immersion, Escapism, and Manipulation-illustrating the multifaceted appeal of these online environments. Male players were significantly more likely to be driven by the Achievement and Manipulation factors, while female players were significantly more likely to be driven by the Relationship factor. Also, the data indicated that users derived meaningful relationships and salient emotional experiences, as well as real-life leadership skills from these virtual environments. MMORPGs are not simply a pastime for teenagers, but a valuable research venue and platform where millions of users inter-act and collaborate using real-time 3D avatars on a daily basis.},

Ninety studies published in English language journals between 1949 and 2004 were included, presenting data from 539 independent samples (the unit of analysis). Results suggest contemporary youth watch on average 1.8-2.8 h of TV per day, depending on age and gender. Most (66\%) are \&$\#$39;low users\&$\#$39; (\&lt; 2 h day(-1)) of TV but 28\% watch more than 4 h day(-1). Boys and girls with access to video games spend approximately 60 and 23 min day(-1), respectively, using this technology. Computer use accounts for an additional 30 min day(-1). Age-specific data suggest TV viewing decreases during adolescence, but those considered \&$\#$39;high users\&$\#$39; at young ages are likely to remain high users when older. For children with access to a television set, the number of hours spent viewing does not appear to have increased over the past 50 years.

However, the current trend towards embodied and social perspectives on interaction provides an alternative way of looking at interactive processes, instead emphasising aspects such as social and physical performance with and around technology. We have explored a range of activities and tools that explicitly address these aspects in programming, with a specific focus on children{\textquoteright}s making of own computer games and simulations. We exemplify this work through three different situations where tools and activities are used by children as recourses for building of interactive systems, while at the same time allowing for bodily action in negotiation of design ideas. We discuss how situations like these may provide directions for new technologies for programming as well as methodological developments in the area of interaction design.},

	abstract = {Background : Video games have received widespread application in health care for distraction and behavior modification therapy. Studies on the effect of cognitive distraction during the preoperative period are lacking. We evaluated the efficacy of an interactive distraction, a hand-held video game (VG) in reducing preoperative anxiety in children. Methods: In a randomized, prospective study of 112 children aged 4-12 years undergoing outpatient surgery, anxiety was assessed after admission and again at mask induction of anesthesia, using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). Postoperative behavior changes were assessed with the Posthospital Behavior Questionnaire (PHBQ). Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: parent presence (PP), PP + a hand-held VG, and PP + 0.5 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam (M) given > 20 min prior to entering the operating room. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in anxiety (P < 0.01) in groups M and PP at induction of anesthesia compared with baseline, but not in VG group. VG patients demonstrated a decrease in anxiety from baseline (median change in mYPAS -3), the difference compared with PP (+11.8) was significant (P = 0.04). The change in anxiety in the M group (+7.3) was not statistically different from other groups. Sixty-three percent of patients in VG group had no change or decrease in anxiety after treatment, compared with 26\% in M group and 28\% in PP group (P = 0.01). There was no difference in anxiety changes between female and male patients. Conclusions: A hand-held VG can be offered to most children as a low cost, easy to implement, portable, and effective method to reduce anxiety in the preoperative area and during induction of anesthesia. Distraction in a pleasurable and familiar activity provides anxiety relief, probably through cognitive and motor absorption.},

	abstract = {This study aims to advance the media effects debate concerning violent video games. Meta-analytic reviews reveal a small but noticeable association between playing violent video games and aggressive reactions. However, evidence for causal associations is still rare. In a novel, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 13 male research participants were observed playing a latest-generation violent video game. Each participant{\textquoteright}s game play was recorded and content analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis. Onscreen activities were coded as either "passive/dead, no a frame interactions"; "active/safe, no imminent danger/no violent interactions"; "active/potential danger occurs, violent interactions expected"; "active/under attack, some violent interactions"; and "active/fighting and killing, many violent interactions." Previous studies in neuroscience on aggressive thoughts and behaviors suggested that virtual violence would suppress affective areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala subsequent to activity variations at cognitive areas of the ACC. Comparison of game play activities with and without virtual violence in 11 participants confirmed the hypothesis. The rather large observed effects can be considered as caused by the virtual violence. We discuss the applicability of neuroscience methodology in media effects studies, with a special emphasis on the assumption of virtuality prevalent in video game play.},

This case study shows systems of stratification and control can arise from the bottom up and be implemented in not only everyday play culture but even player-produced modifications to the game system itself. Due to the ways these systems may simultaneously facilitate play, there is often an ambivalent dynamic at work. This piece also prompts some methodological considerations. By discussing field site choice, the author argues that context is of utmost importance and needs to be more thoughtfully foregrounded within game studies.},

Accordingly, this paper proposes a dynamic scripting method that can sustain the degree of interest intended by the level designer by adjusting the opponent behaviors while playing the game. The player{\textquoteright}s countermeasure pattern for dynamic level design is modeled using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The proposed method is applied to a shooter game, and the experimental results maintain the degree of interest intended by the level designer.},

However, coordination of multiple flocking behaviors to accomplish such tasks remains a challenging problem. This paper reports some progress for implicit coordination and gets swarm intelligence as works based on the flocking behavior. It consists of two parts. In the first part, we study on the pattern formation problem with avoiding complex constraints, that is how can a group of agents be controlled to get into and maintain a formation. The second part considers the studies that use adaptation strategies in controlling multiple agents based on probabilistic methods. Specifically we investigated (1) how probabilistic method is used to reorganize generate group (flocking) behaviors, and (2) how adaptation at the individual level is used to make multiple agents respond to obstacles in the environment.

These strengths are applied towards promoting the understanding of planetary systems and climate change. Unconventional interaction and visualization techniques are introduced as a method to experience geophysical environments. Players are provided with dynamic visualization assets, which enable them to discover, interrogate and correlate scientific data in the game space. The spirit of exploration is to give players the impetus to conceptualize how complex Earth and planetary systems work, understand their intrinsic beauty and the impact of humans, while providing a sense of responsibility for those systems.},

Design: Experimental laboratory study. Setting: University campus situated within an urban environment. Participants: One hundred male undergraduates aged 18 to 21 years. Intervention: Men who had previously reported differing amounts of lifetime home and community violence were randomly assigned to play The Simpsons: Hit and Run (low-violence condition) or Grand Theft Auto III (high-violence condition). Main Outcome Measures: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure; negative affect; hostile social information processing; uncooperative behavior; and permissive attitudes toward violence, alcohol use, marijuana use, and sexual activity without condom use. Results: Men randomly assigned to play Grand Theft Auto III exhibited greater increases in diastolic blood pressure from a baseline rest period to game play, greater negative affect, more permissive attitudes toward using alcohol and marijuana, and more uncooperative behavior in comparison with men randomly assigned to play The Simpsons. Only among participants with greater exposure to home and community violence, play of Grand Theft Auto III led to elevated systolic blood pressure in comparison with play of The Simpsons (mean, 13 vs 5 mm Hg). Conclusions: Media violence exposure may play a role in the development of negative attitudes and behaviors related to health. Although youth growing up in violent homes and communities may become more physiologically aroused by media violence exposure, all youth appear to be at risk for potentially negative outcomes.},

Advanced high resolution scanning technologies such as LIDAR enable us to obtain dense and accurate irregular terrain dataset. However, unlike the regular sampled dataset such as DEM and DTED, irregular dataset cannot be rendered in real-time due to random distribution of samples. Moreover, because they generally have huge amount of point data, it is very hard to manipulate them in consumer PC. We propose a fast and efficient terrain rendering method using large-scale irregular dataset for computer games application. First, it reconstructs the geometry by converting irregular dataset into regular one, through resampling input data with regular interval considering the spatial distribution of sample points. It can generate animated scene by applying quad-tree based rendering method to converted dataset. Experimental results show that its image quality is not deteriorated in comparison to the result of rendering reconstructed geometric models.},

	abstract = {Deformable objects can be used to model soft objects such as clothing, human faces and animal characters. They are important as they can improve the realism of the applications. However, most existing hardware accelerators cannot render deformable objects directly. A tessellation process is often used to convert a deformable object into polygons so that the hardware graphics accelerator may render them. Unfortunately, this tessellation process is computationally very expensive. While the object is deforming, the tessellation process needs to be performed repeatedly to convert the deforming objects into polygons. As a result, deforrnable objects are seldom used in real-time applications such as virtual environments and computer games. Since trimmed NURBS surfaces are often used to represent deformable objects, in this paper we present an efficient method for incremental rendering of deformable trimmed NURBS surfaces. A trimmed NURBS surface typically deforms through the deformation of the trimmed NURBS surface and/or the trimming curve. Our method handles both trimmed surface deformation as well as trimming curve deformation. Experimental results show that our method performs significantly faster than the method used in OpenGL and can be used in real-time applications, such as computer games.},

Analysing re-enactment, {\textquoteright}reality{\textquoteright} history TV and first-person shooter (FPS) computer games, I suggest that engagement with the discourse of {\textquoteright}history{\textquoteright} in popular culture is a complicated and problematic issue. I further suggest that these models offer the professional academic historian a number of interesting methodological and epistemological paradigms. All three of the media I consider refuse to fit into specific, disciplined or institutionalised order. Their dynamism and levels of complexity are crucial to their consumption. Analysis of history-as-experience illustrates that it is a set of narratives divorced from an institutionalised framework, used in different and dissident ways by a variety of social groups. These uses interact with the notion of {\textquoteright}history{\textquoteright} as an academic pursuit but also create a space between ontological and intellectual approaches to the past. On the one hand increased access and interrogation of historical narratives suggests an enfranchising of the population into history; on the other the factuality of history organises and disciplines.},

	abstract = {A fundamental design question to ask in the development of a network game is - -Which transport protocol should be used - -TCP, UDP, or some other protocols? Seeking an objective answer to the choice of communication protocol for MMORPGs, we assess whether TCP, a popular choice, is suitable for MMORPGs based on empirical evidence. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first evaluation of transport protocol performance using real-life game traces.We analyze a 1, 356-million-packet trace from ShenZhou Online, a TCP-based, commercial, mid-sized MMORPG. Our analysis indicates that TCP is unwieldy and inappropriate for MMORPGs. This is due to four distinctive characteristics of MMORPG traffic: 1) tiny packets, 2) low packet rate, 3) application-limited traffic generation, and 4) bidirectional traffic. We show that because TCP was originally designed for unidirectional and network-limited bulk data transfers, it cannot adapt well to MMORPG traffic. In particular, the window-based congestion control and the fast retransmit algorithm for loss recovery are ineffective. Furthermore, TCP is overkill, as not every game packet needs to be transmitted in a reliably and orderly manner. We also show that the degraded network performance did impact users\&$\#$39; willingness to continue a game. Finally, we discuss guidelines in designing transport protocols for online games.

Our hypothesis was that energy expenditure would be significantly greater when children played activity-promoting video games, compared with sedentary video games.METHODS. Energy expenditure was measured for 25 children aged 8 to 12 years, 15 of whom were lean, while they were watching television seated, playing a traditional video game seated, watching television while walking on a treadmill at 1.5 miles per hour, and playing activity-promoting video games.RESULTS. Watching television and playing video games while seated increased energy expenditure by 20 +/- 13\% and 22 +/- 12\% above resting values, respectively. When subjects were walking on the treadmill and watching television, energy expenditure increased by 138 +/- 40\% over resting values. For the activity-promoting video games, energy expenditure increased by 108 +/- 40\% with the EyeToy (Sony Computer Entertainment) and by 172 +/- 68\% with Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2 (Konami Digital Entertainment).CONCLUSIONS. Energy expenditure more than doubles when sedentary screen time is converted to active screen time. Such interventions might be considered for obesity prevention and treatment.},

	abstract = {Here, we demonstrate that action video game play enhances subjects{\textquoteright} ability in two tasks thought to indicate the number of items that can be apprehended. Using an enumeration task, in which participants have to determine the number of quickly flashed squares, accuracy measures showed a near ceiling performance for low numerosities and a sharp drop in performance once a critical number of squares was reached. Importantly, this critical number was higher by about two items in video game players (VGPs) than in non-video game players (NVGPs). A following control study indicated that this improvement was not due to an enhanced ability to instantly apprehend the numerosity of the display, a process known as subitizing, but rather due to an enhancement in the slower more serial process of counting. To confirm that video game play facilitates the processing of multiple objects at once, we compared VGPs and NVGPs on the multiple object tracking task (MOT), which requires the allocation of attention to several items over time. VGPs were able to successfully track approximately two more items than NVGPs. Furthermore, NVGPs trained on an action video game established the causal effect of game playing in the enhanced performance on the two tasks. Together, these studies confirm the view that playing action video games enhances the number of objects that can be apprehended and suggest that this enhancement is mediated by changes in visual short-term memory skills.},

The jumping function is designed to move the cursor to a target instantaneously when the cursor reaches around it while the gravity function is designed to move the cursor to a target gradually. In an experiment conducted to examine their performance, target positioning time, accuracy, and subjective preference were measured and compared with the normal condition (i.e. with no function). The results showed that the gravity function had an advantage in positioning time and accuracy. In addition, the gravity function was preferred to the jumping and the normal condition. Benefits and drawbacks are discussed in using these functions for human-computer interaction. The cursor capturing functions are expected to help older users or novices in operating a mouse efficiently and easily. Relevance to industry The proposed technique can be applied to software applications such as computer games where target positioning is frequent or essential. It may also be used to ease target positioning in various situations, e.g., mobile devices, virtual environment or software for motion-impaired users.},

In contrast to Rheinberg and Vollmeyer, the computer game was modified in order to have less extreme easy and difficult play levels. In the case of the difficult level it was now possible for the participants to have at least minimal success, whereas in Rheinberg and Vollmeyer{\textquoteright}s study the participants were almost unable to act. The results showed the expected effects for the easy and optimal levels but not for the difficult level. In contrast to expectations, the participants indicated high degrees of flow at the difficult level, A possible explanation for this finding is that extremely high demands in a game situation do not reduce the experience of flow under certain conditions. We concluded that games such as Roboguard are not suitable for flow research in general, but only for specific research questions.},

Evolutionary approaches to game artificial intelligence (game AI) have produced successful results for complex game winning strategies, realistic behavior patterns for groups of simulated entities, and more. However, there has been relatively little effort on evolutionary techniques for producing rich NPC behaviors for interaction with human players. To explore whether evolutionary mechanisms can support real-time control of NPCs to produce flexible and purposeful behavior, we present our initial efforts at integrating a genetic algorithm based robotic controller with an off-the-shelf game to control one or more NPCs dynamically. We describe the integration effort and our initial observations, and discuss our plan for achieving richer NPC control and for performing more detailed analysis of the behaviors of the resulting NPCs.

A potential risk factor for this increase is the use of information and communication technology. We studied how the use of computers, the Internet, and mobile phones, playing digital games and viewing television are related to NSP and LBP in adolescents. Methods: Mailed survey with nationally representative samples of 14-, 16-, and 18-year-old Finns in 2003 (n = 6003, response rate 68\%). The outcome variables were weekly NSP and LBP. Results: NSP was perceived by 26\% and LBP by 12\%. When compared with non-users, the risk of NSP was 1.3 (adjusted odds ratios) when using computers > 2-3 h/day, and 1.8 when using 4-5 h/day; 2.5 when using computers >= 42 h/week, and 1.7 when using the Internet >= 42 h/week. Compared with non-users, the risk of LBP was 2.0 when using computers > 5 h/day, 1.7 when using >= 42 h/week, 1.8 when using the Internet >= 42 h/week, and 2.0 when playing digital games > 5 h/day. Times spent on digital gaming, viewing television, and using mobile phones were not associated with NSP, nor were use of mobile phones and viewing television with LBP after adjusting for confounding factors. Conclusions: Frequent computer-related activities are an independent risk factor for NSP and LBP. Daily use of computers exceeding 2-3 h seems to be a threshold for NSP and exceeding 5 h for LBP. Computer-related activities may explain the increase of NSP and LBP in the 1990s and the beginning of 2000.},

	note = {Published on the Chief Technology Officers Network.},
	abstract = {The computer gaming industry has begun to export powerful products and technologies
from its initial entertainment roots to a number of {\textquotedblleft}serious{\textquotedblright} industries. Games are being
adopted for defense, medicine, architecture, education, city planning, and government
applications. Each of these industries is already served by an established family of
companies that typically do not use games or the technologies that support them. The
rapid growth in the power of game technologies and the growing social acceptance of
these technologies has created an environment in which these are displacing other
industry-specific computer hardware and software suites.
This paper puts forward a game impact theory that identifies five specific forces that
compel industries to adopt game technologies for their core products and services. These
five forces are computer hardware costs, game software power, social acceptance, other
industry successes, and native industry experimentation. Together these influence the
degree and rapidity at which game technologies are adopted in a number of industries.
This theory is meant to be useful to managers who must make decisions about adopting,
investigating, or ignoring these new technologies.},

Based on whether spontaneous seizure coexisted or not, these 22 patients were divided into two groups. Ten patients who experienced seizures exclusively while playing or watching specific games were referred to as Group 1, while 12 patients that had both game-induced and spontaneous seizures were classified as Group II. The patients in Group I had a middle-age onset (39.1 years) with a mate predominance (90\%). The electroencephalogram (EEG) or brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed non-specific abnormalities in 60\%, and the partial onset seizure was recognized in 30\% of patients. Antiepileptic drugs had uncertain benefits in this group. In Group II, patients had a mate predominance (67\%), with onset during adolescence (16.3 years). Most of them had generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic seizures, and absences, and 42\% showed epileptiform discharge on EEG. These 12 patients were categorized into idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Although photosensitivity was an important factor, higher mental activity seemed to be significant precipitants of seizures in Group II. Antiepileptic drugs were necessary and valproic acid atone or combined with clonazepam was effective in this group. The results showed that game-related seizures are not a unique and homogeneous syndrome and may consist of different mechanisms. Teenage onset, coexistent spontaneous seizure, and associated idiopathic generalized epilepsies were crucial factors in the determination of antiepileptic drug therapy. Moreover, avoiding the related games altogether may be a more productive preventive measure. },

	abstract = {Graphics-intensive computer games are no longer restricted to high-performance desktops, but are also available on a variety of portable devices ranging from notebooks to PDAs and mobile phones. Battery life has been a major concern in the design of both the hardware and the software for such devices. Towards this, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has emerged as a powerful technique. However, the showcase application for DVFS algorithms so far has largely been video decoding, primarily because it is computationally expensive and its workload exhibits a high degree of variability. This paper investigates the possibility of applying DVFS to interactive computer games, which to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before. We show that the variability in the workload associated with a popular First Person Shooter game like Quake II is significantly higher than video decoding. Although this variability makes game applications an attractive candidate for DVFS, it is unclear if DVFS algorithms can be applied to games due to their interactive (and hence highly unpredictable) nature. In this paper, we show using detailed experiments that (surprisingly) interactive computer games are highly amenable to DVFS. Towards this we present a novel workload characterization of computer games, based on the game engine for Quake II. We believe that our findings might potentially lead to a number of innovative DVFS algorithms targeted towards game applications, exactly as video decoding has motivated a variety of schemes for DVFS.

	abstract = {The real-time interactive 3D multimedia applications such as 3D computer games and virtual reality (VR) have become prominent multimedia applications in recent years. In these applications, both visual fidelity and degree of interactivity are usually crucial to the success or failure of employment. Although the visual fidelity can be increased using more polygons for representing an object, it takes a higher rendering cost and adversely affects the rendering efficiency. To balance between the visual quality and the rendering efficiency, a set of level-of-detail (LOD) meshes has to be generated in advance. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient polygonal mesh simplification algorithm that is capable of generating a set of high-quality discrete LOD meshes in linear run time. The new algorithm adopts memoryless vertex quadric computation, and suggests the use of constant size replacement selection min-heap, pipelined simplification, two-stage optimization, and a new hole-filling scheme, which enable it to generate very high-quality LOD meshes using relatively small amount of main memory space in linear runtime.},

	abstract = {This article examines the notion of genre in video games. The main argument is that the market-based categories of genre that have been developed in the context of video games obscure the new medium\&$\#$39;s crucial defining feature, by dividing them into categories (loosely) organized by their similarities to prior forms of mediation. The article explores the inherent tension between the conception of video games as a unified new media form, and the current fragmented genre-based approach that explicitly or implicitly concatenates video games with prior media forms. This tension reflects the current debate, within the fledgling discipline of Game Studies, between those who advocate narrative as the primary tool for understanding video games, \&quot;narratologists,\&quot; and those that oppose this notion, \&quot;ludologists.\&quot; In reference to this tension, the article argues that video game genres be examined in order to assess what kind of assumptions stem from the uncritical acceptance of genre as a descriptive category. Through a critical examination of the key game genres, this article will demonstrate how the clearly defined genre boundaries collapse to reveal structural similarities between the genres that exist within the current genre system, defined within the context of visual aesthetic or narrative structure. The inability of the current genre descriptions to locate and highlight these particular features suggests that to privilege the categories of the visual and narrative is a failure to understand the medium. The article concludes by suggesting that the tension between \&quot;ludology\&quot; and \&quot;narratology\&quot; can be more constructively engaged by conceptualizing video games as operating in the interplay between these two taxonomies of genre.

One of the reasons is that, typically, an articulated model used in the field has a high degree-of-freedom (DOF) for joints so that it is challenging to devise an easy-to-use interface to control the individual DOR In this paper, as an alternative to existing techniques for controlling articulated characters, we propose the traditional marionette control [I] as natural interfaces to control the characters, and explain how to implement a virtual marionette based on physically-based modelling and haptic paradigm. Using our virtual marionette system, we can rapidly but easily create sophisticated motions for a high-DOF articulated character. Moreover, our system relies on haptic interfaces to model the behavior of real-world marionette controls and provides to the puppeteer responsive forces as a result of the created motions. This results in the puppeteer having a better sense of control over the marionette that she or he manipulates. Our experimentations show that our system can create reasonably complicated motions for articulated characters in an easy and quick manner at highly interactive rates.},

Methods: We conducted an exploratory study with 14 semi-structured interviews of School{\textquoteright}s head masters. Interviews were conducted at the Schools between May and June 2003 in I independent school, 9 state comprehensive schools, and 4 other comprehensive schools within the city of Alicante. Results: The perception of the head masters is that the prevalence of violence is low, more verbal than physical and within gender. They identify lack of punctuality, absenteeism and lack of interest as forms of hostility. As causes they identified age, family problems, school environment, society, media (TV and video-games) and poor language skills. Preventive methods in use were, on one hand, extra-lessons and transversal contents foreseen in the Education Law and common to all schools, and, on the other hand, ideological and pedagogical contents which were specific of some centres. Recommendations focused in demands for increased economic support and skilled human resources. Conclusions: School-based violence is not perceived as an alarming school issue, nor by its magnitude neither by the immediate causes and students{\textquoteright} characteristics to which it is associated. A heavier emphasis is placed on external and environmental causes perceived as much more difficult to confront.},

	abstract = {Hitchers is a game for mobile phones that exploits cellular positioning to support location-based play. Players create digital hitch hikers, giving them names, destinations and questions to ask other players, and then drop them into their current phone cell. Players then search their current cell for hitchers, pick them up, answer their questions, carry them to new locations and drop them again, providing location-labels as hint to where they can be found. In this way, hitchers pass from player to player, phone to phone and cell to cell, gathering information and encouraging players to label cells with meaningful place names. A formative study of Hitchers played by 47 players over 4 months shows how the seams in cellular positioning, including varying cell size, density and overlap, affected the experience. Building on previous discussions of designing for uncertainty and seamful design, we consider five ways of dealing with these seams: removing, hiding, managing, revealing and exploiting them. This leads us to propose the mechanism of a dynamic search focus, to explore new visualization tools for cellular data, and to reconsider the general relationship between {\textquoteright}virtual{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteright}physical{\textquoteright} worlds in location-based games.},

	abstract = {Hybrid reality games (HRGs) employ mobile technologies and GPS devices as tools for transforming physical spaces into interactive game boards. Rather than situating participants in simulated environments, which mimic the physical world, HRGs make use of physical world immersion by merging physical and digital spaces. Online multiuser environments already connect users who do not share contiguous spaces. With mobile devices, players may additionally incorporate interactions with the surrounding physical space. This article is a speculative study about the potential uses of HRGs in education, as activities responsible for taking learning practices outside the closed classroom environment into open, public spaces. Adopting the framework of sociocultural learning theory, the authors analyze design elements of existing HRGs, such as mobility and location awareness, collaboration/sociability, and the configuration of the game space, with the aim of reframing these games into an educational context to foresee how future games might contribute to discovery and learning.

	booktitle = {International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology 2006},
	year = {2006},
	abstract = {MMORPGs have become extremely popular among network gamers. Despite their success, one of MMORPG\&$\#$39;s greatest challenges is the increasing use of game bots, i.e., auto-playing game clients. The use of game bots is considered unsportsmanlike and is therefore forbidden. To keep games in order, game police, played by actual human players, often patrol game zones and question suspicious players. This practice, however, is labor-intensive and ineffective. To address this problem, we analyze the traffic generated by human players vs. game bots and propose solutions to automatically identify game bots.Taking Ragnarok Online, one of the most popular MMOGs, as our subject, we study the traffic generated by mainstream game bots and human players. We find that their traffic is distinguishable by: 1) the regularity in the release time of client commands, 2) the trend and magnitude of traffic burstiness in multiple time scales, and 3) the sensitivity to network conditions. We propose four strategies and two integrated schemes to identify bots. For our data sets, the conservative scheme completely avoids making false accusations against bona fide players, while the progressive scheme tracks game bots down more aggressively. Finally, we show that the proposed methods are generalizable to other games and robust against counter-measures from bot developers.

An ordinary table-top display (cathode ray tube; CRT) and a near-eye display (NED) suitable for mobile gaming are compared in two different driving games. A measurement model based on a large dataset (n=2182) is applied to study psychological aspects of the game adaptation. This model integrates two constructs considered important for the game adaptation: involvement and presence. The results show that the content affected the subjective sense of presence. However, the form did not have an effect on the presence. These results indicate that NED\&$\#$39;s are capable of supporting similar adaptation to the game worlds as compared to CRT\&$\#$39;s. However, the results also weakly indicate that playing with a CRT increases the evaluations of interaction. The study shows the advantages of using multidimensional measures in studying a rich human-computer interaction.

Whereas Japan{\textquoteright}s video-game industry emerged out of corporate sponsorships in arcades, toys, and consumer electronics industries and drew skills from the comic book and animated-film sectors, the video-game industry in the United States evolved from arcades and personal computers.

However, so far these approaches have been limited to mostly static scenes due to the high cost of updating the necessary spatial index structures after modifying scene geometry. In this paper, we present an approach that avoids these updates almost completely for the case of skinned models as typically used in computer games. We assume that the characters are built from meshes with an underlying skeleton structure, where the set of joint angles defines the character{\textquoteright}s pose and determines the skinning parameters. Based on a sampling of the possible pose space we build a static fuzzy kd-tree for each skeleton segment in a fast preprocessing step. This fuzzy kd-tree is then organized into a top-level kd-tree. Together with the skeleton{\textquoteright}s affine transformations this multi-level kd-tree allows fast and efficient scene traversal at runtime, while arbitrary combinations of animation sequences can be applied interactively to the joint angles. We achieve a real-time ray tracing performance of up to 15 frames per second at 1024x1024 resolution even on a single processor core.},

	abstract = {Firms in durable good product markets face incentives to intertemporally price discriminate, by setting high initial prices to sell to consumers with the highest willingness to pay, and cutting prices thereafter to appeal to those with lower willingness to pay. A critical determinant of the profitability of such pricing policies is the extent to which consumers anticipate future price declines, and delay purchases. We develop a framework to investigate empirically the optimal pricing over time of a firm selling a durable-good product to such strategic consumers. Prices in our model are equilibrium outcomes of a game played between forward-looking consumers who strategically delay purchases to avail of lower prices in the future, and a forward-looking firm that takes this consumer behavior into account in formulating its optimal pricing policy. The model incorporates first, a method to infer estimates of demand under dynamic consumer behavior, and second, an algorithm to compute the optimal sequence of prices given these demand estimates. The model is solved using numerical dynamic programming techniques. We present an empirical application to the market for video-games in the US. The results indicate that consumer forward-looking behavior has a significant effect on optimal pricing and profits of games in the industry. Simulations reveal that the profit losses of ignoring forward-looking behavior by consumers are large and conomically significant, and suggest that market research that provides information regarding the extent of discounting by consumers is valuable to video-game firms.},

We are concerned with how to design a game which balances the player{\textquoteright}s focus of attention between traffic and the computer interfaces, to provide a game which is comprehensive, interesting and challenging during a very limited lifetime. The study shows that a tangible user interface enables the player to handle the interaction in the game while watching for cars in the vicinity. Further, the users found multiplayer gaming during brief encounters exciting. However, the study also showed that minimalism is critical to the design. The gestures should preferably be indexical rather than symbolic, and elaborate forms of identification as a condition for manipulative success should be avoided. Finally, tangible user interfaces also allow a type of gaming where players only focus on the computers{\textquoteright} interface, which suppresses the experience of combining traffic interaction with computer interaction.

Using these tools, customers can take on problem-solving tasks and design products to fit their individual needs. To date, arguments in favor of this new concept have been limited to the idea of satisfying each user{\textquoteright}s needs in a highly efficient and valuable way. The aim of this empirical study is to extend our knowledge of how users deal with {\textquoteright}the invitation to innovate{\textquoteright} and how attractive individual user designs might be to other users. In studying the users of toolkits for the immensely popular computer game The Sims, we found that (1) users are not {\textquoteright}one-time shoppers{\textquoteright} {\textendash} in fact, their innovative engagement is rather long-lasting, continuous, evolving, and intense. We also found that (2) leading-edge users do not merely content themselves with the official toolkits provided by the manufacturer. They employ user-created tools to push design possibilities even further. (3) Moreover, individual user designs are not only attractive to the creators themselves; instead, certain innovative solutions are in high demand among other users. Based on our findings, we discuss how toolkits and their users might add to the process of innovation in general. We argue that toolkits could serve as a promising market research tool for guiding a firm{\textquoteright}s new product development efforts. Furthermore, toolkits may serve as a creche for interested but inexperienced users who could evolve into leading-edge users over time. These innovative users might then be integrated into more radical product development efforts.},

It is proposed that the time has come to investigate the role ethnographic methods have to play within auditory interface design. We begin by discussing "traditional" ethnographic methods by presenting our experiences conducting a field study with a major UK-based computer games developer, highlighting issues pertinent to the design of auditory interfaces, before suggesting ways in which such techniques could be expanded to consider the role sound plays in people{\textquoteright}s lived experiences and thus merit further research.},

Klabbers, KMPC, The Netherlands      The purpose of this unique book is to present principles underlying the design and use of gaming and simulation. This frame-of-reference will enlighten the characteristics of particular games and simulations from a common perspective.  The author pays less attention to instrumental reasoning than to methodological questions bexause there is no robust methodology that underpins gaming and simulation methods.  Gaming and simulation are more than methods and tools. They are firstly a way of thinking, and secondly, a method and a technique. In addition, the framework presented will help to grasp the interplay between forms of knowledge and knowledge content in connection with gaming, which evolves through the action of the players.  These notions are  considered preconditions for raising epistemological questions in relation to the educational value of games and simulations.  They will provide a proper context for addressing design science and analytical science approaches to artifact assessment and theory development and testing. Due to the high diversity of approaches within the field the author chooses an interdisciplinary and where appropriate meta-disciplinary approach.

	abstract = {In third-generation (3G) wireless data networks, repeated requests for popular data items can exacerbate the already scarce wireless spectrum. In this paper, we propose an architectural and protocol framework that allows 3G service providers to host efficient content distribution services. We offload the spectrum intensive task of content distribution to an ad hoc network. Less mobile users (resident subscribers) are provided incentives to cache popular data items, while mobile users (transit subscribers) access this data from resident subscribers through the ad hoc network. Since the participants of this data distribution network act as selfish agents, they may collude to maximize their individual payoff. Our proposed protocol discourages potential collusion scenarios. In this architecture, the goal (social function) of the 3G service provider is to have the selfishly motivated resident subscribers service as many data requests as possible. However, the choice of which set of items to cache is left to the individual user. The caching activity among the different users can be modeled as a market sharing game. In this work, we study the Nash equilibria of market sharing games and the performance of such equilibria in terms of a social function. These games are a special case of congestion games that have been studied in the economics literature. In particular, pure strategy Nash equilibria for this set of games exist. We give a polynomial-time algorithm to find a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for a special case, while it is NP-hard to do so in the general case. As for the performance of Nash equilibria, we show that the price of anarchy-the worst case ratio between the social function at any Nash equilibrium and at the social optimum-can be upper bounded by a factor of 2. When the popularity follows a Zipf distribution, the price of anarchy is bounded by 1.45 in the special case where caching any item has a positive reward for all players. We prove that the selfish behavior of computationally bounded agents converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium in a finite number of improvements. Furthermore, we prove that, after each agent computes its response function once using a constant factor approximation algorithm, the outcome of the game is within a factor of O(log n) of the optimal social value, where n is the number of agents. Our simulation scenarios show that the price of anarchy is 30\% better than that of the worst case analysis and that the system quickly (1 or 2 steps) converges to a Nash equilibrium.},

	abstract = {Recent research demonstrates that videogames enhance literacy, attention, reaction time, and higher-level thinking. Several scholars have suggested that massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) such as Everquest and Second Life have educational potential, but we have little data about what happens when such tools are introduced in the classroom. This paper reports findings from two MMO- based courses in the context of situated learning theory. The first course, focused on the ethnography of on- line games, used the game Everquest as a vehicle for teaching research methods to 36 students in an undergraduate communication course. The second course used the game Second Life to teach the fundamentals of videogame design and criticism. Synthesizing comments from student web logs with data collected from followup surveys, the paper highlights key findings and offers concrete suggestions for instructors contemplating the use of multiplayer games in their own courses. Recommending that potential virtual environments be selected on the basis of genre, accessibility, and extensibility, it is suggested that game- based assignments are most effective when they build bridges between the domain of the game world and an overlapping domain of professional practice.},

However, epileptic seizure, another out-of-the-ordinary health problem, is often neglected in this regard. Ten patients who experienced epileptic seizures while playing the newest genre of electronic games-Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs)-were investigated. Patients were predominantly male young adults, and most of the events were generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic seizures, and absences. These patients should be categorized into idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Even though photosensitivity was an important factor, behavioral and higher mental activities also seemed to be significant seizure precipitants. Results demonstrated that MMORPG-induced seizures were not analogous to the ordinary video game-induced seizures. Significantly, an epileptic seizure warning did not always appear on the websites of MMORPGs and instructions for the software. While the prevalence of MMORPG-induced seizures remains unknown, it may exceed our expectations and impact our society. Not only for clinical neurologists but also for the primary physicians, educators, sociologists, and global online game publishers, there should be an awareness of this special form of reflex seizures in order to provide an appropriate health warning to MMORPG players.},

Depictions of race and violence, the pleasure of the carnivalistic gameplay, and the significance of sociopolitical satire in the series are all important elements in this controversy. It is argued that the general perception of digital changed fundamentally following the release of Grand Theft Auto III. The second section of the book approaches the games as they might be studied absent of the controversy. These essays study why and how players meaningfully play Grand Theft Auto games, reflecting on the elements of daily life that are represented in the games. They discuss the connection between game space and real space and the many ways that players mediate the symbols in a game with their minds, computers, and controllers.},

In this study, we argue that in some cases, use of trait, rather than state, aggression can serve to attenuate effects. We report the results of a study in which a trait aggression scale is reworded slightly to create a state measure. The state and trait scales are then compared in high- and low-aggression priming conditions. Results suggest that though both scales are reliable and both have construct validity, the reworded state aggression scale responds more to the high prime than to the low prime. More important, it also responds more than the original trait scale does. Therefore, minor variations in studies of media{\textquoteright}s effect on aggression, such as variations in scale wording, can serve to attenuate effects.},

	abstract = {Objective This study examined self-reported meal skipping and eating faster than usual with the goal of watching television or playing computer games. Method Respondents reported their media use and indicated how often they skipped a meal to watch a favourite television programme or to play a computer game, and how often they ate faster than usual in order to watch television or play a computer game. Subjects Respondents were 2546 adolescents of 13 (first year of secondary school) and 16 years (fourth year of secondary school) of age. Results About one respondent in 10 skipped at least one meal every week for either television viewing or computer game playing. Weekly meal skipping for television viewing occurs more regularly in boys and first-year students, but particularly in teenagers who view 5 h or more daily (15\% of the sample). The category of teenagers who play computer games four times a week or more (25.3\% of the sample) is at increased risk of meal skipping; those who play more than four times a week are 10 times more likely weekly to skip a meal. A quarter of the adolescents eat faster at least once a week to be able to watch television or play a computer game. Regardless of gender and school year, teenagers{\textquoteright} risk of eating faster progressively increases with their use of the media. Those who watch 4 h or more daily are about seven times more likely to skip a meal for television and those who play computer games at least four times a week are nine times more likely weekly to skip a meal. Conclusions Unhealthy eating habits can be a side effect of heavy or excessive media use. Teenagers{\textquoteright} use of television or game computers during nonworking or out-of-school hours partly displaces the amount of time that needs to be spent at meals.

However, the weight updating mechanism of DS is not effective if improper initialization of the rulebase is done. To cope with this problem, we propose a complementary technique to DS that replaces inefficient rules with newly generated rules. Evaluation of the proposed technique is conducted confirming its effectiveness.

Recently, the use of large collections of captured motion data has increased realism in character animation. However, assuming that the virtual environment is large and complex, the effort of capturing motion data in a physical environment and adapting them to an extended virtual environment is the bottleneck for achieving interactive character animation and control. We present a new technique for allowing our animated characters to navigate through a large virtual environment, which is constructed using a set of building blocks. The building blocks, called motion patches, can be arbitrarily assembled to create novel environments. Each patch is annotated with motion data, which informs what actions are available for animated characters within the block. The versatility and flexibility of our approach are demonstrated through examples in which multiple characters are animated and controlled at interactive rates in large, complex virtual environments.},

	abstract = {Massively multiplayer online computer games are played in complex, persistent virtual worlds. Over time, the landscape of these worlds evolves and changes as players create and personalise their own virtual property. In contrast, many non-player characters that populate virtual game worlds possess a fixed set of pre-programmed behaviours and lack the ability to adapt and evolve in time with their surroundings. This paper presents motivated reinforcement learning agents as a means of creating non-player characters that can both evolve and adapt. Motivated reinforcement learning agents explore their environment and learn new behaviours in response to interesting experiences, allowing them to display progressively evolving behavioural patterns. In dynamic worlds, environmental changes provide an additional source of interesting experiences triggering further learning and allowing the agents to adapt their existing behavioural patterns in time with their surroundings.

That relationship was strong in magnitude and independent of sex, socioeconomic status, smoking, and the value participants placed on health, appearance, and achievement. Our results encourage the design of interventions that reduce television watching as a possible means of increasing adolescent physical activity.},

	abstract = {Computer and video games have become an increasingly prevalent form of entertainment. While the primary purpose of games is entertainment, the underlying design employs a variety of strategies and techniques which require players to analyze, synthesize, and to use critical thinking skills. Ironically, these are also many of the same types of critical thinking skills educators and instructional designers attempt to foster when creating educational materials and media. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of a 3D game-based learning environment and to highlight some of the issues that arose during the design, development, and production. Specifically, this paper presents (a) game design elements which can be appropriated (looted) from game design, (b) cognitive research that supports the integration of the elements for instructional design, (c) a discussion of challenges encountered while creating a 3D game-based learning environment with limited resources, and (d) various low-cost and free resources (to avoid ninja looting).

Methods: A questionnaire about using media as a sleep aid, media presence in bedrooms, time to bed and time out of bed on average weekdays and average weekend days, and questions regarding level of tiredness in the morning, at school, after a day at school and after the weekend was completed by 2546 seventh and 10th grade children in a random sample of 15 schools. Results: Of the adolescents, 36.7\% reported watching television to help them fall asleep. In total, 28.2\% of the boys and 14.7\% of the girls used computer games as a sleep aid. Music was used to fall asleep by 60.2\% of the adolescents in this sample. About half of the adolescents read books to fall asleep. Except for reading books, using media as a sleep aid is negatively related to respondents{\textquoteright} time to bed on weekdays, their number of hours of sleep per week and their self-reported level of tiredness. Conclusion: Using media as a sleep aid appears to be common practice among adolescents. Those who reported using music, television, and computer games more often as a sleeping aid slept fewer hours and were significantly more tired.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 36 children who presented with symptoms of urinary urgency and/or daily incontinence completed the treatment and were prospectively evaluated. The mean (range) follow-up was 13.8 (4-24) months, and their mean age 7 (3-14) years, 17 children were aged < 5 years. The children were divided into two groups: group 1, with urge syndrome treated with superficial parasacral electrical stimulation, and group 2, with voiding dysfunction, treated with biofeedback. RESULTS In group 1, the mean (range) number of electrical stimulation sessions was 13.1 (4-20). Of the 19 children treated, 12 had a complete clinical improvement, six a significant improvement, and one a mild improvement. In group 2, the mean (range) number of biofeedback sessions was 6 (4-14). Of the 17 children treated, there was complete improvement of symptoms in 10, significant improvement in two and mild improvement in five. Six children who had no resolution of symptoms after biofeedback had salvage therapy with electrical stimulation, after which four had complete improvement of symptoms, and two a 90\% and 40\% improvement, respectively. Taking the two groups together, after treatment, four children developed isolated episodes of urinary tract infection. Of 21 children with nocturnal enuresis, bed-wetting continued in 13 (62\%) after treatment. CONCLUSION In this short-term follow-up, the nonpharmacological treatment of voiding dysfunction using biofeedback, and of urge syndrome by electrical stimulation, was effective for treating LUTD in children.},

A cross-sectional study was performed on the entire adolescent population (n=833) of a private situated in the city of Sao Paulo. The research included a questionnaire and physical examination of the musculoskeletal system. Statistical analysis was carried out with Fisher, chi-square, Mann Whitney tests and logistic regression. A total of 791 adolescent was evaluated. A computer was used by 99\% and video games by 58\%. Pain was reported by 312 (39.4\%) students: 23\% complained of back pain, 9\% of upper limb pain, 4\% of diffuse pain and 4\% of pain in the trapezium muscle. A clinical examination was carried out in 359 students, and one or more musculoskeletal pain syndromes were present in 56 students (15.6\%): benign joint hypermobility syndrome in 10\%, myofascial syndrome in 5\%, tendonitis in 2\% and fibromyalgia in 1\%. In the multivariate analysis, the logistical regression showed that the independent variables in the prediction of pain were sex [odds ratio (OR): 2.19, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 1.33-3.61] and age (OR: 1.17, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.28) and that the prediction of musculoskeletal pain syndromes were sex (OR: 3.17, 95\% CI: 1.69-6.22) and number of days a week using the computer (OR: 1.22, 95\% CI: 1.05-1.42). However, the variations in the dependent variables by the mathematical regression models were low. Despite the frequent use of computer and video games among adolescents, this was not associated with the presence of pain and musculoskeletal pain syndromes.},

Comparing the various studies is often difficult, because of differences in the populations studied (single seizures, epilepsy centre population, etc.), but also because of different methods (photic stimulator, flash frequencies, eye conditions, etc.) and the terminology used. Finally, and most crucial, in many studies there is often no information on how the data were actually obtained (EEG or clinical data or both?). The popular term "photosensitive" is used widely and applied to patients with a history of visually induced seizures, with and without a photoparoxysmal response (PPR), and to those with only a PPR. An overview of the "hard" data is given with future needs for a better understanding of this type of epilepsy and for improving the endophenotype for genetic research. It is important to standardise the studies as much as possible and describe in detail the methodology of the study, taking at least the above variables into account.},

	abstract = {<p>
Games shape player behaviour by presenting goals which players attempt to fulfil.
This is the most common {\textquotedblleft}folk{\textquotedblright} theory of the relationship between game design and player behaviour. It is also one central to most game design literature and to much work within the game studies field.
</p>
<p>
In this dissertation, the simple idea that players try to win is explicated through a {\textquotedblleft}Rational Player Model{\textquotedblright}, a tool for understanding the relationship between game goals and the behaviour of players who try to reach these goals. The model is discussed and applied in two capacities:
</p>
<p>
A) As a model for formal analysis which can used to understand and categorize certain aspects of games related to goals. Here, video games are studied through the lens of (economic) game theory in order to determine, for instance, the types of conflict dynamics the games will elicit given Rational Player assumptions.
</p>
<p>
B) As an ideal type of actual player behaviour. Here, the model is used to derive concrete predictions about video game player behaviour which are then compared to actual play in an empirical study of multiplayer console gaming. The dissertation finds that the Rational Player Model is one of four models of player behaviour common in the game studies/design literature and that it is the predominant model within game design. Also, the model is found to often operate at so deep a level as to be unstated. Applying the model analytically, video games are
categorized as competitive, semicooperative or cooperative and it is shown how the number of players influence a game{\textquoteright}s conflict dynamics. This leads to an analysis of {\textquotedblleft}strategicness{\textquotedblright} of different game types; a combined measure of the degree to which other players matter to the choices of the {\textquotedblleft}rational{\textquotedblright} player and the range of these choices.
</p>
<p>
Finally, deriving behavioural predictions from the model and comparing these to data from a study on multiplayer console play, players are found to behave {\textquotedblleft}rationally{\textquotedblright} within the gamespace itself while working to fulfil various social functions in their verbal interaction.

Based on a study of children between the ages of 8 and 11 playing video games in after school clubs in Sydney, Australia, the paper argues that most video games are one site for the production of contemporary masculinity. On this basis it is argued that girls playing games have to negotiate complex performances which demand qualities traditionally ascribed to masculinity alongside those ascribed to femininity. This produces difficulties for girls in competing to win while at the same time displaying sensitivity, caring, and co-operation. This is discussed by analysing what happens when some girls play.

From security training simulations to war games to role-playing games, to sports games to gambling, playing video games has become a social phenomena, and the increasing number of players that cross gender, culture, and age is on a dramatic upward trajectory. Playing Video Games: Motives, Responses, and Consequences integrates communication, psychology, and technology to examine the psychological and mediated aspects of playing video games. It is the first volume to delve deeply into these aspects of computer game play. It fits squarely into the media psychology arm of entertainment studies, the next big wave in media studies. The book targets one of the most popular and pervasive media in modern times, and it will serve to define the area of study and provide a theoretical spine for future research.

	abstract = {The effects of violent media on behavior have been studied for decades. <strong>Less studied are the effects of prosocial media on behavior</strong> (Hogan, in press), <strong>especially in terms of video games.</strong> Following the design of Bushman and Anderson (2001) participants were assigned to one of three video game conditions: violent, prosocial, neutral. After playing for ten minutes, participants completed three stories (Car Accident, Persuading a Friend, The Room [about a messy roommate]) writing what would happen next (what would the protagonist do, say, think, feel). Responses were scored for violent (harmful, aggressive), prosocial (helpful, empathic, supportive), and neutral remarks. Across conditions there were no significant differences for aggressive responses. <strong>Importantly, the number of prosocial remarks in the prosocial condition was significantly greater than in the aggression or neutral conditions. Those in the prosocial condition produced more prosocial endings to stories. </strong>Playing video games creates social biases that influence feelings, attitudes, and behavior. Which biases are created are influenced by what kind of game is played. Playing positive games may increase the likelihood of thinking, feeling, and behaving morally and suppress the violent priming of videogame media generally. Media may be used in multiple positive ways to build moral character.

Recently, large collections of motion capture data have been exploited for increased realism in avatar animation and control. Large motion sets have the advantage of accommodating a broad variety of natural human motion. However, when a motion set is large, the time required to identify an appropriate sequence of motions is the bottleneck for achieving interactive avatar control. In this paper, we present a novel method of precomputing avatar behavior from Unlabeled motion data in order to animate and control avatars at minimal runtime cost. Based on dynamic programming, our method finds a control policy that indicates how the avatar should act in any given situation. We demonstrate the effectiveness Of our approach through examples that include avatars interacting with each other and with the User. },

Although this activity reportedly has many adverse effects on child development, these effects remain controversial.

A Hitachi Optical Topography system was used to measure hemoglobin changes. For all subjects, the video game Donkey Kong((R)) was played on a Game Boy((R)) device. After spectroscopic probes were positioned on the scalp near the target brain regions, the participants were asked to play the game for nine periods of 15 s each, with 15-s rest intervals between these task periods. Significant increases in bilateral prefrontal total-hemoglobin concentrations were observed in four of the adults during video game playing. On the other hand, significant decreases in bilateral prefrontal total-hemoglobin concentrations were seen in two of the children. A significant positive correlation between mean oxy-hemoglobin changes in the prefrontal region and those in the bilateral motor cortex area was seen in adults. Playing video games gave rise to dynamic changes in cerebral blood volume in both age groups, while the difference in the prefrontal oxygenation patterns suggested an age-dependent utilization of different neural circuits during video game tasks.},

Random screening is not effective in identifying children at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM): therefore, there is a need to apply screening strategies that guide the development of appropriate primary prevention efforts. To assess the prevalence of risk factors for T2DM, 1066 fifth-grade children were screened using American Diabetes Association guidelines. Overall, 22.6\% were found at risk; African American and Hispanic children were almost 8 times more likely, to be at risk when compared to Caucasians (odds ratio 7.41 and 7.87). Children who reported watching TV/playing video games 2 or more hours/day, were 73\% more likely, to be at risk. Children identified to be at risk were referred to their primary care provider and were invited to participate in a counseling session. The environmental risk factors for T2DM identified in this study are modifiable and should be targeted in preventive interventions at the school and community level to reduce overweight and consequently prevent 72DM in children, especially among minority children.},

A similar relation with robotic surgical skills has not been tested. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prior video-game experience enhances the acquisition of robotic surgical skills. Subjects and Methods: A series of 242 preclinical medical students completed a self-reported video-game questionnaire detailing the frequency, duration, and peak playing time. The 10 students with the highest and lowest video-game exposure completed a follow-up questionnaire further quantifying video game, sports, musical instrument, and craft and hobby exposure. Each subject viewed a training video demonstrating the use of the da Vinci surgical robot in tying knots, followed by 3 minutes of proctored practice time. Subjects then tied knots for 5 minutes while an independent blinded observer recorded the number of knots tied, missed knots, frayed sutures, broken sutures, and mechanical errors. Results: The mean playing time for the 10 game players was 15,136 total hours (range 5,840-30,000 hours). Video-game players tied fewer knots than nonplayers (5.8 v 9.0; P = 0.04). Subjects who had played sports for at least 4 years had fewer mechanical errors (P = 0.04), broke fewer sutures (P = 0.01), and committed fewer total errors (P = 0.01). Similarly, those playing musical instruments longer than 5 years missed fewer knots (P = 0.05). Conclusions: In the extremes of video-game experience tested in this study, game playing was inversely correlated with the ability to learn robotic suturing. This study suggests that advanced surgical skills such as robotic suturing may be learned more quickly by athletes and musicians. Prior extensive video-game exposure had a negative impact on robotic performance.},

	title = {Projecting Tension in Virtual Environments through lighting.},
	booktitle = {ACE 2006},
	year = {2006},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT
Interactive synthetic environments are currently used in a wide
variety of applications, including video games, exposure therapy,
education, and training. Their success in such domains relies on
their immersive and engagement qualities. Filmmakers and
theatre directors use many techniques to project tension in the
hope of affecting audiences{\textquoteright} affective states. These techniques
include narrative, sound effects, camera movements, and lighting.
This paper focuses on temporal variation of lighting color and its
use in evoking tension within interactive virtual worlds. Many
game titles adopt some cinematic lighting effects to evoke certain
moods, particularly saturated red colored lighting, flickering
lights, and very dark lighting. Such effects may result in user
frustration due to the lack of balance between the desire to project
tension and the desire to use lighting for other goals, such as
visibility and depth projection. In addition, many of the lighting
effects used in game titles are very obvious and obtrusive. In this
paper, the author will identify several lighting color patterns, both
obtrusive and subtle, based on a qualitative study of several
movies and lighting design theories. In addition to identifying
these patterns, the author also presents a system that dynamically
modulates the lighting within an interactive environment to
project the desired tension while balancing other lighting goals,
such as establishing visibility, projecting depth, and providing
motivation for lighting direction. This work extends the author{\textquoteright}s
previous work on the Expressive Lighting Engine [1-3]. Results
of incorporating this system within a game will be discussed.},

The mean distance between the agents, the frequency of gaze toward the partner, and the frequency of mutual gaze between partners showed substantial and theoretically meaningful relationships with the attitude toward the partner and communication patterns, but not with. relationship satisfaction and partner specific romantic attachment. The effect sizes of correlations were in line with typical correlations between questionnaire and behavior measures in the relationship literature. The results confirm the validity of the VE as an alternative method to the much more costly observation study in the laboratory. Individual differences in experience with similar computer games did not influence the results, and the occurrence of cybersickness was successfully prevented by an appropriate graphic layout.},

Conclusion: An inverse association was observed between sleep duration and the risk to develop childhood overweight/obesity.

Traditional ergotherapy has adapted to the new mediators of the young (video games, multimedia, cinema, etc.). At the same time it has made a step in the direction of occupations which involve the physical body more explicitly - when any such association had usually been excluded from therapeutic mediations that privileged the verbal expression as the principal tool to restart the symbolisation process. We have set out to investigate the part such body-oriented mediations play, and whether they are a superior mean in dealing with patients resistant to other forms of assistance. We have concerned ourselves with the indoor climbing activities which take place in the out patient "care and study" department of the hospital (Clinique Dupre). We reason that the learning and safety aspects of indoor climbing permit to re-enact regressive phenomena associated to the repetition of early experiences of distress. Climbing as a mediation opens the therapeutic doors by allowing the physical resurrection of those early experiences which had yet to be symbolised.},

	abstract = {During the last 30 years computer and videogames have grown into a large entertainment industry of economical as well as cultural and social importance.As a distinctive field of academic inquiry begins to evolve in the form of game studies, the majority of approaches can be identified as emerging either from a background of literary theory which motivates a concentration on narrative structures or from a dedicated focus on the rules in video and computer games. However, one of the most evident properties of those games is their shared participation in a variety of spatial illusions. Although most researchers share the view that issues related to mediated space are among the most significant factors characterising the new medium, as of yet, no coherent conceptual exploration of space and spatial representation in video and computer games has been undertaken. This thesis focuses on the novel spatial paradigms emerging from computer and video games. It aims to develop an original theoretical framework that takes the hybrid nature of the medium into account. The goal of this work is to extend the present range of methodologies directed towards the analysis of digital games. In order to reveal the roots of the spatial apparatus at work an overview of the most significant conceptions of space in western thought is given. Henri Lefebvre{\textquoteright}s reading of space as a triad of perceived, conceived and lived space is adopted. This serves to account for the multifaceted nature of the subject, enables the integration of divergent spatial conceptions as part of a coherent framework, and highlights the importance of experiential notions of spatiality. Starting from Michel Foucault{\textquoteright}s notion of the heterotopia, game-space is posited as the dynamic interplay between different spatial modalities. As constitutive elements of the dynamic spatial system mobilized by digital games the following modalities are advanced: the physical space of the player, the space emerging from the narrative, the rules, the audiovisual representation and the kinaesthetic link between player and game. These different modalities are examined in detail in the light of a selected range of exemplary games. Based on a discussion of film theory in this context an original model that serves to distinguish between different visual representational strategies is presented. A chapter is dedicated to the analysis of the crucial and often overlooked role of sound for the generation of spatial illusions. It is argued that sound has to be regarded as the privileged element that enables the active use of representational space in three dimensions. Finally the proposed model is mobilised to explore how the work of contemporary artists relates to the spatial paradigms set forth by digital games. The critical dimension of artistic work in this context is outlined. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the impact of the prevalent modes of spatial practice in computer and video games on wider areas of everyday life.},

Participants were 41 adolescents (M age = 14.8; male = 29; female = 12) from rural Appalachia. Participants attended 3 weekly sessions and played I of 3 video games (basketball, fighting, or horror) each time. Measures included heart rate (HR); systolic blood pressure (SBP); diastolic blood pressure (DBP); self-reported aggression, anger, and reactions to game play; and history of video game play. Resting and posttest cardiovascular measures did not differ from session to session. Adolescents displayed HR and SBP reactivity to game play within each session. They also demonstrated decreased SBP and DBP responding to video game play across the 3-week period, regardless of game content. Affective responses did not change significantly across the course of the experiment. Adolescents who played the violent games reported more frustration and arousal than those who played the sports game. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

The second part of the paper deals with selected digital games created in the Middle East, whose authors are knowingly working with the topic of self-representation. Recent digital games originating in the Middle East can be perceived as examples of an ongoing digital emancipation taking place through the distribution of media images and their corresponding meanings. A key part of this ongoing digital emancipation involves the construction of Arab and Islamic heroes, a process accomplished by exploiting distinctive narrative structures and references to Islamic cultural heritage.},

Unlike any other social science research technology, such games provide for both sufficient participation numbers and careful control of experimental conditions, making them like Petri dishes for social science. This article examines two examples of games as Petri dishes for macro-level coordination effects: (a) the location of markets inside EverQuest and (b) the selection of battlefields inside Dark Age of Camelot.},

It is hypothesised that low empathy and attitudes that predispose people towards violence are more strongly related to exposure to violent films and computer games than to superordinate personality traits (e.g., EPQ psychoticism, extraversion, antisocial personality traits), or subtraits, such as sensation-seeking. Four hundred and thirty-three students in further education completed three personality questionnaires, a questionnaire of attitudes towards violence, and reported on their use of violent computer games, films and videos. Multivariate analyses in the form of ordinary least squares (OLS) models were used to test the primary hypotheses. Acceptance of violence, as measured by the Maudsley Violence Questionnaire (MVQ), was the strongest and most consistent predictor of violent media use. Superordinate personality traits were generally fully mediated by acceptance of violence. The findings emphasise the importance of general acceptance of violence in the consumption of violent games and films. Some gender differences emerged; particularly in relation to the use of violent computer games. Empathy had no significant effects for either males or females.},

Methods: 1,039 South Australian children aged 10-13 years old completed a multimedia 24-hour activity recall diary on 2-4 occasions in 2002, including at least one school day and one non-school day. Results: The median screen time was 229 minutes.d(-1).

To investigate the effectiveness of computerized virtual reality (VR) training of the hemiparetic hand of patients poststroke using a system that provides repetitive motor reeducation and skill reacquisition. Methods. Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. Results. Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table. Conclusions. It is difficult in current service delivery models to provide the intensity of practice that appears to be needed to effect neural reorganization and functional changes poststroke. Computerized exercise systems may be a way to maximize both the patients{\textquoteright} and the clinicians{\textquoteright} time. The data in this study add support to the proposal to explore novel technologies for incorporation into current practice.},

	abstract = {Since the first computer games became available, sex has played a role in some form. But with the release of games like Playboy: The Mansion, Leisure Suit Larry, and The Singles, sexual content has gained a firm foothold and for the first time, ventured into the mainstream. Even casual games like The Sims have started to rev things up a bit, and in on-line games, tales of {\textquotedblleft}cybering{\textquotedblright} have become commonplace. This {\textquotedblleft}sexual revolution{\textquotedblright} in games has generated intense scrutiny of the games industry by political watchdog groups and family-oriented organizations.

And it has brought the importance of self-regulation and rating systems to the forefront of the industry. Seeking to understand this emerging trend, developers, publishers, retailers, and consumers are asking themselves: When is sex appropriate in a game? How far is too far? What will it mean for the product? For its distribution? For my company? For me? Do games with sexual content sell better? Are they generally profitable? So far, there are no definitive answers to these questions. Sex in Video Games provides insight into this issue and presents guidelines and answers by studying the history of sexual content use in games and within the industry itself. In addition, the book considers ethical issues, parental and retailer responsibility, and explores industry attempts at self-regulation, along with a growing concern about potential censorship.

	abstract = {Objectives: To test whether the results of the accumulated studies on media violence and aggressive behavior are consistent with the theories that have evolved to explain the effects. We tested for the existence of both short-term and long-term effects for aggressive behavior. We also tested the theory-driven hypothesis that short-term effects should be greater for adults and long-term effects should be greater for children. Design: Meta-analysis. Participants: Children younger than 18 years and adults. Main Exposures: Violent media, including TV, movies, video games, music, and comic books. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (eg, heart rate, blood pressure), and helping behavior. Results: Effect size estimates were combined using meta-analytic procedures. As expected, the short-term effects of violent media were greater for adults than for children whereas the long-term effects were greater for children than for adults. The results also showed that there were overall modest but significant effect sizes for exposure to media violence on aggressive behaviors, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, arousal levels, and helping behavior. Conclusions: The results are consistent with the theory that short- term effects are mostly due to the priming of existing well-encoded scripts, schemas, or beliefs, which adults have had more time to encode. In contrast, long-term effects require the learning (encoding) of scripts, schemas, or beliefs. Children can encode new scripts, schemas, and beliefs via observational learning with less interference and effort than adults.},

Young physicians have extensive experience with computer-based or "video" games, priming them for medical education-and treating their patients-via new technologies. We report our use of standardized patients (SPs) to educate physicians on the diagnosis and treatment of biological and chemical warfare agent exposure. We trained professional actors to serve as SPs representing exposure to biological agents such as anthrax and smallpox. We rotated workshop participants through teaching stations to interview, examine, diagnose and treat SPs. We also trained SPs to simulate a chemical mass casualty (MASCAL) incident. Workshop participants worked together to treat MASCAL victims, followed by discussion of key teaching points. More recently, we developed computer-based simulation (CBS) modules of patients exposed to biological agents. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of CBS vs. live SPs. Finally, we detail plans for a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy compared to pharmacotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is associated with significant disability and healthcare costs, which may be ameliorated by the identification of more effective therapy.},

	abstract = {Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games are highly successful, in terms of sales, and their content is part of an explicit business strategy which aims to exploit the latest technologies and platforms to develop content aimed at adult game players in certain markets. By all accounts this has been a highly successful strategy with the GTA franchise selling more than 30 million units across platforms by 2004, even before Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (GTA SA) was launched in late 2004 (Take Two Interactive 2004). The latter was the top selling console game in the USA and in the top ten in the UK in 2005. At the same time the GTA series are arguably the most maligned of game products in many markets attracting much negative commentary and numerous legal actions in the USA. This chapter argues that the GTA case demonstrates a key tension within the cultural industries between the need to maximise sales globally and the need to conform to, or be seen to conform to, local distribution, social and moral systems. At the same time the story demonstrates that despite the widespread rhetoric of free trade and the dismantling of state sanctioned censorship systems in the USA, most parts of Europe and Australia, the censorship of cultural products continues and is perhaps a less overt, but nonetheless, highly political, socially negotiated and nationally specific process.

In the present study, we examined whether similar changes were observed in children. Twenty children (7-14 years old) participated in our study, but only 13 of them were eventually subject to analysis. They played one or two commercially available video games; namely a fighting and a puzzle game, for 5 min. We used changes in concentration of oxyHb as an indicator of brain activity and consequently, most of the children exhibited a sustained game-related oxyHb decrease in DPFC. Decrease patterns of oxyHb in children during video game playing time did not differ from those in adults. There was no significant correlation between ages or game performances and changes in oxyHb. These findings suggest that game-related oxyHb decrease in DPFC is a common phenomenon to adults and children at least older than 7 years old, and we suggest that this probably results from attention demand from the video games rather than from subject{\textquoteright}s age and performance.},

difference in academic achievement between students who use video games in learning and those
who do not, while also looking at differences of gender, ethnicity, and age. A video game was
added to half the classes teaching management to 3rd year students. Identical testing situations
and materials were used while data collected included who did and did not play the game,
student test scores, class number, gender, ethnicity, and age. Means tests, ANOVA, Chi-squared,
and t tests were used to test the effectiveness of game use.
Classes using the game scored significantly higher means those classes that did not.
There were no significant differences between genders, while both genders scored significantly
higher with game play. There were no significant differences between ethnicities, while all
ethnic groups scored significantly higher with game play. However, students 40 years and below
scored significantly higher with game play, while students 41 and older did not.
The implications for social change are enormous. Such dramatic increases in student
learning could lead to simulation and games as standard teaching tools in most curriculum areas.

To examine sedentary behaviours (including television viewing, playing computer games and computer use), diet, exercise and fitness in relation to overweight/obesity in Australian adolescents. Methods. Questionnaires elicited food frequency data, time spent in TV viewing, using computers, other sedentary occupations and physical activity recall. Weight, height and fitness (laps completed in the Leger test) were measured. Results. Among 281 boys and 321 girls, mean age 12 years (SD 0.9), 56 boys (20.0\%) and 70 girls (23.3\%) were overweight/obese. Greater fitness was associated with decreased risk of overweight/obesity in boys (Odds ratio [OR] 0.74; 95\% CI 0.55, 0.99) and girls (OR 0.93; 95\% CI 0.91, 0.99). TV-viewing predicted increased risk in boys (OR 1.04; 95{\textquoteright}\% CI 1.01, 1.06) and decreased risk in girls (OR 0.99; 95\% CI 0.96, 0.99). Computer use, video games, and other sedentary behaviours were not significantly related to risk of overweight/obesity. Vegetable intake was associated with lower risk in boys (OR 0.98; 95\% CI 0.97, 0.99); greater risk was associated with lower fat intake in boys and girls, lower consumption of energy-dense snacks in boys (OR 0.74; 95\% CI 0.62, 0.88) and greater intake of vegetables in girls (OR 1.02; 95\% CI 1.00, 1.03), suggesting dieting or knowledge of favourable dietary choices in overweight/obese children. Conclusions. Among these adolescents, fitness was negatively related to risk for overweight/obesity in boys and girls. TV-viewing was a positive predictor in boys and a negative predictor in girls but the effect size was small; other sedentary behaviours did not predict risk.},

	abstract = {Modern video games represent highly advanced virtual reality simulations and often contain virtual violence. In a significant amount of young males, playing video games is a quotidian activity, making it an almost natural behavior. Recordings of brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during gameplay may reflect neuronal correlates of real-life behavior. We recorded 13 experienced gamers (18-26 years; average 14 hrs/week playing) while playing a violent first-person shooter game (a violent computer game played in self-perspective) by means of distortion and dephasing reduced fMRI (3 T; single-shot triple-echo echo-planar imaging [EPI]). Content analysis of the video and sound with 100 ms time resolution achieved relevant behavioral variables. These variables explained significant signal variance across large distributed networks. Occurrence of violent scenes revealed significant neuronal correlates in an event-related design. Activation of dorsal and deactivation of rostral anterior cingulate and amygdala characterized the mid-frontal pattern related to virtual violence. Statistics and effect sizes can be considered large at these areas. Optimized imaging strategies allowed for single-subject and for single-trial analysis with good image quality at basal brain structures. We propose that virtual environments can be used to study neuronal processes involved in semi-naturalistic behavior as determined by content analysis. Importantly, the activation pattern reflects brain-environment interactions rather than stimulus responses as observed in classical experimental designs. We relate our findings to the general discussion on social effects of playing first-person shooter games.},

In this paper we give a brief survey of the current researches on user model for adaptation and personalization of services and some empirical studies of user model in games and interactive narration. We propose three possible levels of the user model: generic, localized and personalized and three types of narration scheme. We will describe that the user model and narration schemes can be used in a mixed reality system.

Findings - This paper identifies five important shifts in the conceptualization of value creation by highlighting a growing prevalence in the literature of several ecological metaphors used to explain business processes, namely: the shift from thinking about consumers to co-creators of value; the shift from thinking about value chains to value networks; the shift from thinking about product value to network value; the shift from thinking about simple co-operation or competition to complex co-opetition; and the shift from thinking about individual firm strategy to strategy in relation to value ecologies. Originality/value - This paper synthesizes emerging trends in the literature in relation to value creation and defines the concept of a value-creating ecology.

In particular, three key notions of value, power and embeddedness are used to reveal the most powerful actors in the production network, how they maintain and exercise their power, and how the organization of production is manipulated as a result. It is argued that while hardware production is organized by console manufacturers using truly global sourcing strategies, the production of software is far more complex. In fact, software production networks are bounded within three major economic regions, Western Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. This paper seeks to explain how and why this has occurred.},

present results showing different visual attention patterns that

games and first person shooter games. In addition, analyzing
visual attention patterns within a complex 3D game environment
presents a new challenge because the environment is very

Eleven senior endoscopists were included in our study. Before the simulated endoscopies in GI Mentor II.

The results of the visuospatial tests were cot-related to the performance parameters of the virtual-reality endoscopy simulator. The percent of time spent with clear view in the simulated colonoscopy correlated well with the performance in the visuospatial PicSOr (r = -0.75, P = 0.01), card rotation (r = 0.75, P = 0.01), and cube comparison (r = 0.79, P = 0.004) tests. The endoscopists who performed better in the visuospatial tests also were better at maintaining visualization of the colon lumen. Those who performed better in the PicSOr test formed fewer loops during colonoscopy (r = 0.60, P = 0.05). In the technically less demanding simulated gastroscopy, there were no Such correlations. The visuospatial tests performed better in endoscopists not playing computer games. Good visuospatial ability correlates significantly with the performance of experienced endoscopists in a technically demanding simulated colonoscopy, but not in the less demanding simulated gastroscopy.},

As a complement to current game control technology, we present the VoodooIO Gaming Kit, a real-time adaptable gaming controller. We introduce the concept of appropriable gaming devices, which allow players to define and actively reconfigure their gaming space, making it appropriate to their personal preference and gaming needs. The technology and its conceived usage are illustrated through its application to two commercially available computer games, as well as through the results of a formal user study.

For people, relationships are created with the help of behaviour-shaping norms, which infants begin to discover and manipulate by the third month. To build relationships, machines can also learn to exploit human reactions in real-time decision-making. In the video game Tetris, for example, affect co-opts computer-generated patterns to simplify cognitive tasks: norms mediate what Kirsh and Maglio (Cognitive Sci., 18, pp. 513-549, 1994) term epistemic actions, which allow implicit knowledge to shape key pressing in ways that, given past games, are likely to be informative and valuable. Expert players act to change their cognitive states by allowing the game{\textquoteright}s higher-level states to constrain their lower-level actions. Since this process enables the development of expertise, we might expect it to be widespread; but it seems marginal in hamadryas baboons, although they use affect and complex norms. In humans, by contrast, infants use adults as cognitive resources in developing their epistemic abilities. This has engineering implications for android designers. Since androids can elicit epistemic actions, engineers need to develop an affect sensitive inter-face. If successful at this, even rudimentary co-action may prompt people to report experiencing androids as both making choices and violating expectations.},

The aim of this study has been to describe <strong>what the avatar is, how it structures our play and our participation with a fictional world,</strong> and how avatar-based singleplayer computer games are different from other kinds of singleplayer games; the avatar exploits the concretising realism of the computer as a simulating machine, and situates us in a gameworld via prosthetic and fictional embodiment.

The proposed coding scheme is based on an existing list of breakdown indication types of the detailed video analysis method (DEVAN). This method was developed to detect usability problems in task-based products for adults. However, the new coding scheme for children{\textquoteright}s computer games takes into account that in games, fun, in addition to usability, is an important factor and that children behave differently from adults. Therefore, the proposed coding scheme uses 8 of the 14 original breakdown indications and has 7 new indications. The article first discusses the development of the new coding scheme. Subsequently, the article describes the reliability assessment of the coding scheme. The any-two agreement measure of 38.5\% shows that thresholds for when certain user behavior is worth coding will be different for different evaluators. However, the any-two agreement of .92 for a fixed list of observation points shows that the distinction between the available codes is clear to most evaluators. Finally, a pilot study shows that training can increase any-two agreement considerably by decreasing the number of unique observations, in comparison with the number of agreed upon observations.},

Operators of ISP networks are faced with the challenge of minimizing routing disruptions using current routing technology, which offers little control. In this article we discuss routing disruptions from an ISP perspective. First, we describe the causes and effects of routing changes. Then we provide a set of network design guidelines and operational practices that network operators can use to reduce the impact of routing changes in their network.},

	abstract = {Pervasive Gaming (PG) denotes a noteworthy change in the history and nature of computer games. By intentionally merging virtual and physical space, pervasive gaming not only extends the magic circle of play; it further challenges our conception of game rules, game mechanics, and game entities. This paper introduces and discusses some of the key characteristics of this novel trend in computer games. Following a short description of the significant features of pervasive computing, Walther explicates pervasive gaming in relation to time, space, and presence (or immersion). Then I position four axes or zones of pervasive gaming: mobility, distribution, persistence, and transmediality. Further, I describe and analyse three essential units of PG (rules, entities, and mechanics), and finally, I speculate about the role of space in PG by differentiating between tangible space, information space, and accessibility space.},

However, this is not to suggest that HCI has little to offer the game design community. Indeed, the exact opposite appears to be true. A number of user-centred design techniques have evolved which can support each stage of the game design process, from concept through to post-production. However, there is currently no archive of appropriate techniques showing how they might be applied to videogame design. Given the differences in goals from these products to traditional software, this is clearly necessary. The purpose of this workshop is to identify those techniques appropriate to game design, and elicit practitioners{\textquoteright} experience when applying such methodologies. The intended result is a prescriptive process which demonstrates how user-centred methodologies can best be applied to game design.},

Careful examination of learning opportunities present in gaming requires us to direct our attention to the characteristics of MMORPGs and how these characteristics support learning. MMORPGs accommodate active learners who assume the role of characters they have selected, create immersive environments that promote the development of conceptual knowledge and engage players in social interaction among a community of players. Since MMORPGs support social interaction between players, MMORPGs serve as the catalyst for fostering students language proficiency as students interact in a foreign language while playing the game. For these reasons, we believe that MMORPGs embody an interesting and underutilized learning environment for second language acquisition. Based upon this premise, we introduce a game-language learning model and explore Sony Online Entertainments 3D game Ever Quest II as a pedagogical tool for students learning English as a second language.},

Computer game is one of the software applied in most mobile embedded devices that be requested to handle more and more functions in recent year. Most researches of computer games focus on AI performance, computer vision, even social sciences. On the other hand, a large and increasing number of embedded systems are subject to tight power constraints, but strangely no one pays attention to the games on mobile embedded device at present. Our work recognizes the need to provide embedded software designers with feedback about the effect of different algorithms of computer games on energy consumption early in the design cycle. The ability to efficiently analyze battery life under different design choices of games is an important aid in designing battery-efficient systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of energy requirements in a wide range of the most used algorithms in different computer game types. Based on our results, we conclude and discuss various opportunities for realizing energy-efficient implementations of game algorithms. We believe that such investigations will be an important first step towards addressing the challenges of energy efficient algorithms for battery-constrained systems.},

Citing from her recent ethnographic research studying intergame immigration between massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs), the author describes one case in which players ejected from the MMOGUru: Ages Beyond Myst became highly productive, creating artifacts from Uru in other virtual worlds like There and Second Life. Over time, the Uru Diaspora expanded the game{\textquoteright}s culture, eventually creating their own original Uru-and Myst-inspired artifacts, including an entirely new game.},

The scenario- of the game is that of a player interacting with embodied fairy-tale characters in a 3D world via spoken dialogue (supplemented by graphical pointing actions) to solve various problems. The player himself cannot directly perform actions in the world, but interacts with the fairy-tale characters to have them perform various tasks, and to get information about the world and the problems to solve. Hence the role of spoken dialogue as the primary means of control is obvious and natural to the player. Naturally, this means that robust spoken language understanding becomes a critical component. To this end, the paper describes a semantic representation formalism and an accompanying parsing algorithm which works off the output of the speech recogniser{\textquoteright}s statistical language model. The evaluation shows that the parser is robust in the sense of considerably improving on the noisy output of the speech recogniser. },

This paper describes how we began with an existing single-server online game engine and enhanced it to become a multiserver MMOG engine running on a grid. other approaches require that a game be specifically designed to scale to MMOG player levels. Our approach, using IBM OptimalGrid middleware (which provides an abstracted underlying grid infrastructure to an application) allowed us to reuse an existing game engine without the need to make any significant changes to it. In this paper we examine the design elements needed by an MMOG and provide a practical implementation example-the extension of the id Software Quake 110 game engine using OptimalGrid middleware. A key feature of this work is the ability to programmatically partition a game world onto a dynamically chosen and sized set of servers, each serving one or more regions of the map, followed by the reintegration of the distributed game world into a seamless presentation for game clients. We explore novel features developed in this work and present results of our initial performance validation experiments with the resulting system.},

	abstract = {In recent years, large scale distributed virtual environments have become a major trend in distributed applications, mainly due to the enormous popularity of multiplayer online games in the entertainment industry. Thus, scalability has become an essential issue for these highly interactive systems. In this paper, we propose a new synchronization technique for those distributed virtual environments that are based on networked-server architectures. Unlike other methods described in the literature, the proposed technique takes into account the updating messages exchanged by avatars, thus releasing the servers from updating the location of such avatars when synchronizing the state of the system. As a result, the communications required for synchronization are greatly reduced, and this method results more scalable. Also, these communications are distributed along the whole synchronization period, in order to reduce workload peaks. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the percentage of CPU utilization in the servers when compared with other existing methods, therefore supporting a higher number of avatars. Additionally, the system response time is reduced accordingly.},

Knuckle pads can be painful, cosmetically unappealing, and refractory to treatment. They can now be recognized as yet another potential adverse consequence of chronic video game playing.},

In the proposed game service, downloading games or game items, managing players, etc. are provided using cellular network. The actual game traffic between players utilizes WPAN.

Despite this neglect, however, the connections between older toys and video games point to several important issues in hurnanities-based game studies, including those that investigate the place of game studies in academia and the archiving and preservation of games. By connecting video games to a variety of nonelectronic predecessors, this article raises several questions linked to video game classification, the hybridity of video games, and the problems that hybrid forms must negotiate. Toward this end, we specifically address movable books and toy theaters in relation to video games like Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door (2004) to show how video games both draw on and change earlier interactive entertainment formats. Overall, this article explicates the relationship between games and older forms like movable books to show how comparative studies of older forms can elucidate and inform current scholarship.

	abstract = {In computer and video games, the player resides at the interface of viewer and actor. This position makes possible the player's creative participation in these interactive media, a contribution that cannot be described in terms of the traditional roles of creator or consumer. The player is more than a consumer of what game developers and designers have created, and more than a reader or viewer. A game designer {\textquotedblleft}creates a context to be encountered by a participant, from which meaning emerges{\textquotedblright} (Salen and Zimmerman 41). In the last decade or so, game players have used computer games as platforms for creating their own games, narratives, texts, and performances. They have reshaped the context of computer play, not simply by creating personal artifacts equivalent to a home movie, doodle, or diary, but by fully exploiting games as a new medium for performance and artistic expression. These efforts on occasion have challenged storytelling technologies such as frame-based animation, and have entered the mainstream through music videos, web-based serial programming, and other popular formats. The performer has pushed forward into the spotlight of game culture. So, how might game studies reveal players as performers? Learning more about the meanings players attach to play gestures, studying high-level competitive play, understanding what it means to watch others as they play, examining more closely the significance of replays and game movies in game culture, describing the formation of player identities, documenting in-game social dynamics, and tracing the networked virtual communities that thrive around computer games are but a few of many topics that might contribute to better understanding of game performance. This article presents a few ideas about players' active participation in game culture through one mode of visible public performance: machinima and related game movies.

Pew Senior Research Fellow Steve Jones\&$\#$39; recent report found, in fact, that 32\% of the college students he surveyed (sample size= 1,162) \&quot;admitted playing games that were not part of the instructional activities during classes\&quot; (2). Despite students\&$\#$39; best efforts to hide their play, in-class gaming is rarely clandestine; the phenomenon is easily detectable from across the room by the \&quot;game glaze\&quot; on players\&$\#$39; faces. The intensity and ubiquity of this play, as well as the proliferation of personal computers, cell phones, PDAs and other gaming devices in college classrooms, prompted us to ask how we might use games to our pedagogical advantage. This article describes several strategies we have developed over the past several years for teaching media culture- that is, teaching students about the socio-cultural, economic and ideological elements of the mass media- with the most recent addition to the media stable, computer games.

	abstract = {Lighting design is an important topic of game development. There are many functions
that lighting assumes in game environments, including directing attention, establishing
good action visibility, evoking emotions, setting atmosphere, and providing depth.
Current lighting design techniques rely on static manually designed lighting, where designers
set up the positions, angles, and colors for each light in a level. Game environments are
dynamic and unpredictable; physical and narrative scene content, including character locations,
tension, and narrative goals, change unpredictably in real time due to user interaction.
Thus, current static techniques often do not adequately adapt to serve desired aesthetic and
communicative functions or perceptual effects. Recently, Doom 3 incorporated dynamic
real-time lighting and demonstrated many advantages of using real-time dynamic lighting in
games, including heightening the emotional engagement and enhancing the overall interactive
experience. However, the technique is scripted and tightly coupled to game content. In
this article, we present ELE (Expressive Lighting Engine), an intelligent lighting system that
automatically sets and adjusts scene lighting in real time to achieve aesthetic and communicative
functions, including evoking emotions, directing visual focus, and providing visibility
and depth. ELE operates as a separate system that interacts with game/graphics engines
through a standard interface. In this article, we will discuss ELE and its interface with Unreal
Tournament 2003. We will also present results showing ELE in action. These results show:
{\textbullet} Utility of real-time adaptive lighting in providing visual focus, setting atmosphere,
evoking emotions, and establishing visibility during interaction in interactive
environments
{\textbullet} Acceleration in the development process due to the introduction of an automatic
system for lighting that can be overridden by designers at a high level, thus eliminating
the time-consuming process of setting individual light parameters for each level and
scene.},

This game is categorised as a first-person shooter (FPS), and is a multiplayer networked game. Differences between this game and other first-person shooters such as Quake III include the realism that Counter Strike achieves and the immersive qualities that surround that player. Different experiments were completed; group one, the control group, where the participants were tested three times without playing computer games between tests and group two where they were only tested twice, but played Counter Strike for two hours before the second test. This group showed a statistically significant improvement in their multitasking abilities. In summary, this study indicates that certain types of computer games can improve cognitive functions, and suggests further research to ascertain if these abilities are retained and what other skills can be enhanced by games similar to Counter Strike.},

	abstract = {Information visualisation applications have been facing ever-increasing demands as the amount of available information has increased exponentially. With this, the number and complexity of visualisation tools for analysing and exploring data has also increased dramatically, making development and evolution of these systems difficult. We describe an investigation into reusing technology developed for computer games to create collaborative information visualisation tools. A framework for using game engines for information visualisation is presented together with an analysis of how the capabilities and constraints of a game engine influence the mapping of data into graphical representations and the interaction with it. Based on this research a source code comprehension tool was implemented using the Quake 3 computer game engine. It was found that game engines can be a good basis for an information visualisation tool, provided that the visualisations and interactions required meet certain criteria, mainly that the visualisation can be represented in terms of a limited number of discrete, interactive, and physical entities placed in a static 3-dimensional world of limited size. <br />

	abstract = {21st Century Game Design is not just a book about game design. It{\textquoteright}s an answer to two important questions: who are we designing games for and how do we do it best? Written by industry pros, the book teaches designers how to design better games from a why perspective. All good designers know the fundamentals of how to design a game, but learning to design games that really satisfy your players takes more than technical skill. To do this successfully, you need to know your intended audience and understand their needs. Throughout the book you{\textquoteright}ll learn about defining and investigating player needs. A model of play styles is then presented that was developed by applying psychological metrics to survey data and case studies. This model identifi es some of the core themes in player needs as represented by four player types-- Conqueror, Manager, Wanderer, and Participant. In addition to discussing player needs, the book also explores how games can reach wider audiences by appealing to the interests of the core gaming community, and it considers the fundamental principles of game design. Methods such as interface design, structural elements, and game world abstractions are discussed in relation to the needs of the audience. The book does not attempt to present an absolute view of the craft of game design, but rather it demonstrates how an audience model can inform the design process and take the games industry forward at a time when it is facing a schism between the games that the audience would like to play, and the games the development community would like to make. Game designers, producers, marketing executives, and anyone who wishes to understand the relationship between a game and its audience will find much to learn from 21st Century Game Design.},

Previous research suggests that vestibular and proprioceptive information provided by immersive interfaces facilitates spatial orientation on simple path-integration tasks. We examine whether these interface variables impact performance across paths of variable complexity. Our immersive interface provided all users the ability to conduct the search component of our task more efficiently. Our results, however, show that the immersive interface was no more effective than our nonimmersive one for maintaining orientation. In fact, the immersive interface had a negative impact on performance (absolute error) for individuals who had extensive experience with playing video games. When measured in terms of consistency of response, our results suggest that having extensive game-play experience will negatively impact orientation performance with both interfaces. We speculate that this is due to the conflicting nature of the skills that avid game players acquire in game-play versus those required to perform in our task.},

With the autonomous adaptation scheme, each intelligent character steadily assesses changes of its game environment while taking into consideration recently earned scores, and initiates a new learning process when a change is detected. Intelligent characters may confront various opponents in many computer games. When each intelligent character has fought with just part of the opponents, the cooperative adaptation scheme, based on a genetic algorithm, creates new intelligent characters by composing their partial knowledge of the existing intelligent characters. The experimental results show that intelligent characters can properly accommodate to the changes with the proposed schemes.},

We argue that video games not only diffuse cultural and symbolic meanings, but also provide new loci for reflection and critique of issues of inter alia race. Two different analytical perspectives are juxtaposed when studying racial issues of GTA3. The first perspective is Critical Race Theory (CRT). The second perspective derives from the phthonic and incongruity theory of humour (Morreall 1986). We will argue that the CRT perspective is consistent with the phthonic theory of humour, while the incongruity theory goes beyond CRT presenting a novel way of interpreting games. This theoretical framework is applied when analysing the controversial game GTA3. By presenting stereotypical images of race in GTA3 as humorous, the player is provided with cues for reflecting and evaluating his/her own perspectives on issues of race.},

In this paper, we propose a new method to simulate reactive motions during arbitrary bipedal activities, such as standing, walking or running. It is based on momentum based inverse kinematics and motion blending. When generating the animation, the user first imports the primary motion to which the perturbation is to be applied to. According to the condition of the impact, the system selects a reactive motion from the database of pre-captured stepping and reactive motions. It then blends the selected motion into the primary motion using momentum-based inverse kinematics. Since the reactive motions can be edited in real-time, the criteria for motion search can be much relaxed than previous methods, and therefore, the computational cost for motion search can be reduced. Using our method, it is possible to generate reactive motions by applying external perturbations to the characters at arbitrary moment while they are performing some actions.},

RL has commonly been used in competitive environments, in which the agent must perform as well as possible to beat its opponent.

The ludology/narratology debate exhibits two important features: anxiety about the proximity of the discipline to the games industry, and a formalist bias that dominates the field. Focussing on race and alignment in role playing games, this paper addresses this bias by asserting the relevance of cultural materialist and postcolonial modes of critique to commercially-produced computer games. It is argued that games like Baldur{\textquoteright}s Gate I and II cannot be properly understood without reference to the fantasy novels that inform them. When historicised, the genre of fantasy reveals an implicit reliance on notions of race and moral alignment. The ways these notions re-appear in digital role playing games is shown to be relevant to current political and social realities of the West.},

This niche, as yet remains undeveloped by the overwhelming majority of publicly funded university level academic institutions in North America. Acutely aware of the fact that a B.Sc. degree proposal with an emphasis on computer game development will draw both friendly and enemy fire, the curriculum proposed is a careful blend of both the established ACM and IGDA curriculums. It is reasoned that this will not only satisfy game industry needs, but that it will do so without sacrificing curriculum integrity of the computing science component provided by a normal B.Sc Computing Science.},

It has been argued that creating the personality for a player character is problematic. However, there are multiple methods used in games to inform a player about the nature of a player character: predefined functions, goals, possible and impossible actions, and more traditional audiovisual means. In this paper the player character of Silent Hill 3 is analyzed using presented categorization. This paper shows that the classification is a useful analytic tool, but it needs to be developed further to include belongings and space as elements describing a player character. The categorization also highlights aspects that need to be addressed when designing player characters.},

The correct application of these principles and techniques produces filmed content that is more engaging, compelling and absorbing for the viewer. 3D computer games employ virtual cameras in order to provide the player with an appropriate view of the game world. These virtual cameras can simulate all of the functionality of their real-world counterparts yet little effort is usually made to incorporate cinematographic techniques and principles into their operation. We introduce CameraBots, autonomous camera operators modelled closely on the non-player characters (NPCs) or bots already present in many games. CameraBots can perform a larger set of operations than their real-world counterparts since they are not subject to the same physical restraints. Thus, cinematographic principles can be applied to camera work with relative ease by reusing bot program code already present. Our system contains a director module and a cinematographer module which together are responsible for coordinating the CameraBots in a manner consistent with cinematography rules and practice. It is designed in a modular manner such that it may be applied to numerous computer games with little modification.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Performance of laparoscopic surgery requires adequate hand-eye coordination. Video games are an effective way to judge one{\textquoteright}s hand-eye coordination, and practicing these games may improve one{\textquoteright}s skills. Our goal was to see if there is a correlation between skill in video games and skill in laparoscopy. Also, we hoped to demonstrate that practicing video games can improve one{\textquoteright}s laparoscopic skills. Subjects and Methods: Eleven medical students (nine male, two female) volunteered to participate. On day 1, each student played three commercially available video games (Top Spin, XSN Sports; Project Gotham Racing 2, Bizarre Creations; and Amped 2, XSN Sports) for 30 minutes on an X-box (Microsoft, Seattle, WA) and was judged both objectively and subjectively. Next, the students performed four laparoscopic tasks (object transfer, tracing a figure-of-eight, suture placement, and knot-tying) in a swine model and were assessed for time to complete the task, number of errors committed, and hand-eye coordination. The students were then randomized to control (group A) or "training" (i.e., video game practicing; group B) arms. Two weeks later, all students repeated the laparoscopic skills laboratory and were reassessed. Results: Spearman correlation coefficients demonstrated a significant relation between many of the parameters, particularly time to complete each task and hand-eye coordination at the different games. There was a weaker association between video game performance and both laparoscopic errors committed and hand-eye coordination. Group B subjects did not improve significantly over those in group A in any measure (P >0.05 for all). Conclusion: Video game aptitude appears to predict the level of laparoscopic skill in the novice surgeon. In this study, practicing video games did not improve one{\textquoteright}s laparoscopic skill significantly, but a larger study with more practice time could prove games to be helpful.},

Personality and emotion-driven Believable Agents are needed in areas like human-machine interfaces, electronic advertising and, most notably, electronic entertainment. Computer models of personality can help explain personality by illustrating its underlying structure and dynamics. This work presents a neural network model of personality and personality change. The goals are to help understand personality and create more realistic and believable characters for interactive video games. The model is based largely on trait theories of personality. Behaviour in the model results from the interaction of three components: (1) personality-based predispositions for behaviour, (2) moods/emotions and (3) environmental situations. Personality develops gradually over time depending on the situations encountered. Modelling personality change produces interesting and believable virtual characters whose behaviours change in psychologically plausible ways.},

Design/methodology/approach - This research draws on over two dozen qualitative interviews and an open-ended survey of an additional 50 game players with a wide range of gameplay experience. Findings - Findings suggest that players have different skill sets, and different beliefs about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable help in a variety of games. These findings are analyzed to argue for different ways to enhance the educational gaming experience for players. Research limitations/implications - As with all qualitative research, the relatively small sample size makes it difficult to draw broad generalizations from the data. However, the research does suggest that there are many ways to play games, that players use many items and information \&quot;outside\&quot; the game to help them play or enhance their experience, and such things can be fruitfully used to improve educational games. Practical implications - Designers of educational games should take into account the materials surrounding games, such as walkthroughs and codes, as ways to enhance the game and educational experience, rather than detract from them. Originality/value - Very little research has been done examining how players perceive items and information related to game play, as well as how they use such things. This research investigates that area and relates the knowledge to ways to improve educational games, and education.

Although a less well-researched medium at this point, violent video and computer games (referred to simply as video games) may have particular impact because of their actively engaging, content-generating nature . Recent content analyses suggested that up to 90\% of all video games contain some sort of violent content, with at least half of these games including the potential for serious harm toward game characters . Such violent video games have become especially popular, even with relatively young children. In a recent survey of first through third graders, 53\% of the children{\textquoteright}s favorite games had violent content, as rated by the children themselves (Jeanne Funk, PhD, Margaret Chan, unpublished data, 2004). In another recent survey of middle school volunteers, students listed and rated up to three favorite games using a list of six categories and descriptors developed with the help of children and adolescents  and used in several previous studies. In that study, 99\% of boys and 84\% of girls categorized at least one of their current preferred video games as having violent content . The inescapable conclusion is that across childhood and adolescence and across gender, violent video games enjoy considerable popularity.},

The results of the evaluation show that educational virtual reality games can be very motivating while retaining or even improving the educational effects on students.

Referring back to his work Homo Ludens (1938) I will discuss the various relationships between role-play and ritual performance.

Too often, game designers create games that satisfy their own perceptions of a good game without considering the needs of the consumers that will play the games. Customer driven computer game design applies the critical incident technique as a means to define the elements of good and bad game. A methodology is described whereby game designers establish the goal and intentions of the game by listening to the voice of the consumer. The concept was tested by distributing CIT surveys to active game players who each wrote two stories about their game playing behavior and experiences. The first story described the respondent{\textquoteright}s best experience playing games and the second story described their worst experience. The stories were archived and content analyzed using Gremler{\textquoteright}s best-practice methods for identifying categories and critical incidents. A summary sheet describing the frequency of good and bad incidents was derived by three coders. The respondents{\textquoteright} original game playing stories were further abstracted into key good and bad descriptions and appended to the summary CIT frequency data sheet to create a consumer game report. The report was then used by creative designers as a reference point for designing new games.},

Players accumulate these competencies according to the patterns of access and peer culture they encounter. The constituents of preference, such as access, are shaped by gender, and as a result, gaming preferences may manifest along gendered lines. It is not difficult to generate data, indicating that gendered tastes exist, but it is shortsighted to separate such outcomes from the various practices that contribute to their formation.

An initial correlational study shows that video game violence exposure (VVE) is positively correlated with self-reports of aggressive behavior and that this relation is robust to controlling for multiple aspects of personality. A tab experiment showed that individuals low in VVE behave more aggressively after playing a violent video game than after a nonviolent game but that those high in VVE display relatively high levels of aggression regardless of game content. Mediational analyses show that trait hostility, empathy, and hostile perceptions partially account for the VVE, effect on aggression. These findings suggest that repeated exposure to video game violence increases aggressive behavior in part via changes in cognitive and personality factors associated with desensitization.},

Participants (N= 48) were randomly assigned to play either a violent or a nonviolent version of the video game Doom (TM) in dyads. Following the video-game task, participants were separated and given an opportunity to choose to cooperate with their partner for mutual gain, withdraw from the interaction, or exploit their partner for their own benefit. Participants in the violent condition were significantly more likely to choose to exploit their partners than participants in the nonviolent condition. These findings suggest that playing violent video games may undermine prosocial motivation and promote exploitive behavior in social interactions.},

Using data from a large-scale national survey sponsored by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the authors conducted multiple regressions predicting time spent watching television, watching videos/ DVDs, reading, playing video games, and using computers. Child{\textquoteright}s age, race, parents{\textquoteright} education, and parents{\textquoteright} marital status had significant effects across most types of media use, whereas child{\textquoteright}s gender birth order, languages spoken at home, parents I employment status, and parents{\textquoteright} age had only occasional, isolated effects.

	year = {2005},
	abstract = {Increasing emotional engagement in 3-D interactive environments is a hard, but important problem. It is important
for its potential utility in increasing motivation, involvement, and engagement. These constructs are not only useful
for entertainment applications, but also impact training and edutainment applications due to the impact of emotions
on learning (Ulate, 2002; Wolfe, 2001). Many researchers have explored several techniques, including enhancing
the story content to stimulate emotional engagement, developing new algorithms for dynamically creating stunning
visual effects, and enhancing 3-D sound. Theatre and film have integrated many techniques that increase
engagement, attention, and emotional involvement. In this paper, I describe a set of new design techniques
integrated in an architecture that uses theatric and cinematic theories, specifically acting and screenwriting methods,
to stimulate and improve emotional engagement in 3-D interactive narratives. In this paper, I discuss two research
directions: (1) defining an interaction model for 3-D interactive narrative based on screenwriting theories, and (2)
developing an actor-based agent architecture to simulate believable actions within an interactive narrative. The
resulting architecture was implemented and tested within Mirage, an interactive story based on the Greek Tragedy
Electra. Based on the critiques from several participants, I deduce that the resulting architecture presents
significantly encouraging design techniques that can potentially increase emotional involvement and dramatic
content of an interactive desktop 3D VR experience. The system and approach presented in this paper demonstrates
an important new direction that adds to the set of techniques currently used and expand the design methodologies to
include methods from disciplines, such as performance arts, theatre, and film.},

However, the auto-playing programs, either software or hardware, do harm to games servers in various ways including abuse of resources. In this paper, we propose a way of detecting the auto programs by analyzing the window event sequences produced by the game players. In our proposed method, the event sequences are transformed into a set of attributes, and various leaming algorithms are applied to classify the data represented by the set of attribute values into human or auto player. The results from experiments with several MMORPGs show that the Decision Tree learning with proposed method can identify the auto-playing programs with high accuracy.

A new observation was the lowering of the eyelids to a state of half-closed.

The prototype proposes a way to integrate the technology in a way that makes use of children\&$\#$39;s natural curiosity and motivation for game playing combined with the joy of working with food and thus is a step on the road to producing a learning resource in an area that until now has been dominated by electronic recipe managers and digital health-tracking managers.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: {\textquoteright}PC Game Rooms{\textquoteright} were first popularized in Korea, although the concept is now becoming popular worldwide. PC Game Rooms provide users with high-performance PC connected to the high-speed internet, and access to computer games. However, PC Game Room users are exposed to various hazardous agents such as cigarette smoke in a confined environment, and thus it is likely that excessive PC Game Room use involves abnormal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as well as being associated with disturbed sleep or circadian rhythm. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the exposure to PAH was evaluated by measuring urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and 2-naphthol. The correlations between PC Game Room use and PAH exposure and plasma testosterone and LH levels were analysed in 208 young male Koreans. RESULTS: Urinary 1-OHP concentrations increased (P=0.0001) and plasma testosterone levels decreased (P=0.0153) significantly with increased duration of PC Game Room use. Correlation analysis showed that plasma testosterone concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with urinary 1-OHP (r=-0.22, P=0.0012) and 2-naphthol (r=-0.15, P=0.0308) concentrations. Moreover, these associations persisted after adjusting for other independent variables. However, the duration of PC Game Room use itself was not found to be an independent significant determinant of plasma testosterone level. Rather, PC Game Room use increased PAH exposure, which decreased plasma testosterone level. The younger age group (15-19 years) showed a more prominent decrease in plasma testosterone concentrations with increasing duration of PC Game Room use than the older age group (20-24 years) (r(2)=0.355, P=0.0301 versus r(2)=0.213, P=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that the excessive use of PC Game Rooms is related to an adverse impact on sex hormonal status in young male Koreans via PAH exposure. This effect was more prominent in the younger age group.},

Both groups were equally good at inhibiting the return of attention to previously cued locations, although VGPs displayed overall faster reaction times to detect targets. VGPs also showed overall faster response time for easy and difficult visual search tasks compared to NVGPs, largely attributed to faster stimulus-response mapping. The findings suggest that relative to NVGPs, VGPs rely on similar types of visual processing strategies but possess faster stimulus-response mappings in visual attention tasks. },

Seven male adults (24.7 +/- 5.6 years old) played exciting computer games with a bright display (game-BD) and a dark display (game-DD) and performed simple tasks with low mental load as a control condition in front of a BD (control-BD) and DD (control-DD) between 23:00 and 1:45 hours in randomized order and then went to bed at 2:00 hours and slept until 8:00 hours. Rectal temperature, electroencephalogram (EEG), heart rate and subjective sleepiness were recorded before sleep and a polysomnogram was recorded during sleep. Heart rate was significantly higher after playing games than after the control conditions, and it was also significantly higher after using the BD than after using the DD. Subjective sleepiness and relative theta power of EEG were significantly lower after playing games than after the control conditions. Sleep latency was significantly longer after playing games than after the control conditions. REM sleep was significantly shorter after the playing games than after the control conditions. No significant effects of either computer games or BD were found on slow-wave sleep. These results suggest that playing an exciting computer game affects sleep latency and REM sleep but that a bright display does not affect sleep variables.},

The author uses theories about media and emotion as well as theories about emotion as a process to develop a model for the unfolding of emotion in violent video games. It is argued that violent video games provide a gratifying context for the experience of emotions. The fact that gamers are largely in control of the game implies that they can voluntarily select the emotional situations they confront. This freedom is attractive for adolescents who are in the midst of constructing an identity. For them, the violent game is a safe, private laboratory where they can experience different emotions, including those that arc controversial in ordinary life. Gamers may deliberately select emotions that sustain dominant masculine identity (e.g., anger), as well as emotions that are at odds with dominant masculinity (e.g., fear).},

Patients with BPD (n = 24) were characterized by somewhat more extreme game evaluations in the emotionally negative situations than normal controls (n = 25), participants with a cluster C (n = 10) or an antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) (n = 16). Patients with BPD appeared to be characterized best by a general negative evaluative style, more than by DT or splitting. ASPD participants showed a positivity bias in both conditions.},

	abstract = {Research driving the mandates of the current education reform law, No Child Left Behind, indicates a 300\% increase during the last 10 years in students being labeled with specific learning disabilities. In addition there has been a dramatic increase in the number of minority students labeled as having learning and emotional disabilities (U.S. Department of Education, 2002). One possible reason for this disturbing evidence is that our teachers and schools are not prepared to assess the skills or meet the needs of a new generation of learners entering their classrooms. The new generation the author is referring to are those students who have daily access to interactive 3D environments, spend a significant amount of time exploring that environment and have the skills to maneuver and problem-solve within it. These environments are the 3D worlds of video games. There is evidence indicating the same students who are most at risk for failure in the traditional classroom setting also spend an average of twenty-seven minutes per day more than their counterparts using video games. The author of this article asserts that the use of video games as a teaching tool deserves serious consideration as a means of presenting information and bridging learning concepts. She argues that exploring the use of video games in the classroom forces educators to reevaluate their role as \&$\#$39;teacher\&$\#$39;. Video games allow teachers to share learning experiences with the students and to label and extend the student\&$\#$39;s learning in such a way as to truly prepare the child for future challenges. The author recommends today\&$\#$39;s teachers, and especially those just entering the profession, partner with the students and get on board--the students are already there.

To date, no reliable data for this phenomenon in Germany exists. In the present study, the excessive usage of computer and video games is seen as a rewarding behavior which can, due to learning mechanisms, become a prominent and inadequate strategy for children to cope with negative emotions like frustration, uneasiness and fears. In the survey, 323 children ranging in age from 11 to 14 years were asked about their video game playing behavior. Criteria for excessive computer and video game playing were developed in accordance with the criteria for dependency and pathological gambling (DSM-IV, ICD-10). Data show that 9.3\% (N = 30) of the children fulfill all criteria for excessive computer and video game playing. Furthermore, these children differ from their class mates with respect to watching television, communication patterns, the ability to concentrate in school lectures and the preferred strategies coping with negative emotions. In accordance with findings in studies about substance-related addiction, data suggest that excessive computer and video game players use their excessive rewarding behavior specifically as an inadequate stress coping strategy.},

It argues that affective response incorporates physiological and temporal dimensions that lie outside the domain of linear time and conscious choice, using examples of games like Rez that link positive player experience to bodily awareness and uncontrollable biological responses.

The model includes three components: sensory, challenge-based and imaginative immersion (SCI-model). The classification was assessed with self-evaluation questionnaires filled in by informants who played different popular games. It was found that the gameplay experiences related to these games did indeed differ as expected in terms of the identified three immersion components.},

The membership functions are aligned to the average crisp input that was successfully used in the past winning games. Fuzzeval mechanisms are adaptive and have the simplicity associated with fuzzy controllers. Our experiments show that Fuzzeval improves its performance up to 42\% after a match of only one hundred backgammon games played against Pubeval, a strong intermediate level program.},

Motivation has long been considered as an important step in learning. Researchers suggest Csikszentmihalyi{\textquoteright}s Flow Theory as a method for understanding and implementing motivation. This bears significance since games foster play, which produces a state of flow, which increases motivation, which supports the learning process. However, this relationship is not as straightforward as it first seems. Research also shows that reflection is an important part of the learning process and while in the state of flow, players rarely reflect on the learning that is taking place. This paper explains how games can act as effective learning environments by integrating reflection into the process of play, producing an endogenous learning experience that is intrinsically motivating.},

A critical view at the value of classic film theory for this style concludes the paper.},

	abstract = {An exploratory survey was undertaken about the appeal of playing video games at a Local Area Network (LAN) event where personal computers are linked in order to play both face-to-face and online. First, we wanted to know who the visitors of a LAN event were, because there is hardly any research available about this class of gamers. Second, we wanted to know why they participated in a LAN event. The survey showed that LAN gamers were almost exclusively male, with a mean age of 19.5 years. They devoted about 2.6 hours each day to gaming. They were motivated by social contact and a need to know more about games. The competition motive was third in the total sample. A subgroup of heavy gamers obtained a higher score on competition. This article emphasizes the importance of the social context of gaming and interprets its results as a nuance of the stereotype of the solitary, adolescent gamer.},

The paper explores the notion of and the ways in which First-Person Shooters complicate our conception of embodiment. Offering an ethnographically-influenced semiotic analysis of playing a FPS, the paper begins by declaring that we are typically not aware of our bodies and that playing a FPS gives us another body on which to concentrate causing an erasure of the physical body. It is then asserted that the virtual body is also rendered invisible due to the perspective and speed of the game resulting in a double erasure of the body leaving behind only the mind.},

We demonstrate how the amount of relative attention paid to key subjects of narrative importance may guide the outcome of a narrative branching. An experiment was conducted to test the operation of gaze guided film. The experiment involved 11 subjects influencing a two-minute film clip by gaze in two scenarios. In the first case subjects were aware that gaze could be used to control the narrative, and in the second case the subjects were unaware of this control. The outcome was found to be quite uniform across subjects, and it was not influenced by repetitions or by knowledge about the control option. Comments from the aware users indicated that they were looking for confirmation of gaze selections from the system. Thus, non-intrusive feedback seems to be fundamental for a successful gaze-interactive media. We suggest a range of discrete audio and visual effects that may serve this purpose and present some narrative control principles.},

This is achieved by leveraging functionality on recent graphics programming units (GPUs) in combination with a novel approach to model non physics-based, yet realistic variations in flow fields. We show how to use this mechanism for simulating effects as demonstrated in Figure 1. Physics-based simulation is performed on 2D proxy geometries, and simulation results are extruded to 3D using particle or texture based approaches. Our method allows the animator to model and to flexibly control the dynamic behavior of volumetric effects, and it can be used to create plausible animations of a variety of natural phenomena.},

Large gender differences, which favored men, were found in computer experience. Although men and women also differed on SAT scores, gender differences in computer experience were still apparent with SAT factored out. Furthermore, men and women with high and low levels of computer experience, who were selected for more intensive study, were found to differ significantly on the Mental Rotations Test (MRT). Path analyses showed that computer experience substantially mediates the gender difference in spatial ability observed on the MRT. These results collectively suggest that the "Digital Divide" is an important phenomenon and that encouraging women and girls to gain spatial experiences, such as computer usage, might help to bridge the gap in spatial ability between the sexes.},

The aim of this review is to consider the research evidence from a public-health perspective. A search of published work revealed five meta-analytic reviews and one quasi-systematic review, all of which were from North America. There is consistent evidence that violent imagery in television, film and video, and computer games has substantial short-term effects on arousal, thoughts, and emotions, increasing the likelihood of aggressive or fearful behaviour in younger children, especially in boys. The evidence becomes inconsistent when considering older children and teenagers, and long-term outcomes for all ages. The multifactorial nature of aggression is emphasised, together with the methodological difficulties of showing causation. Nevertheless, a small but significant association is shown in the research, with an effect size that has a substantial effect on public health. By Contrast, only weak evidence from correlation studies links media violence directly to crime.},

Experiment 2 revealed that pictures of hunting guns were more likely to prime aggressive thoughts among nonhunters, whereas pictures of assault guns were more likely to prime aggressive thoughts among hunters. Experiment 3 showed differences in aggressive behavior following gun primes that correspond to differences in affective and cognitive responses to gun cues.

The Internet Playground argues that, contrary to the promises of technology boosters, teaching with computers is very difficult. Seiter points out that the Internet today resembles a mall more than it does a library. While children love to play online games, join fan communities, and use online chat and instant messaging, the Internet is also an appallingly aggressive marketer to children and, as this book passionately argues, an educational boondoggle.

	title = {Learning through Game Modding},
	booktitle = {Games, Learning and Society (GLS)},
	year = {2005},
	abstract = {Some researchers have suggested that designing and implementing games
can lead to deeper forms of learning than simply playing games created
by others. Learner design efforts may benefit from the increasing
number of computational engines that allow users to customize and
expand game behaviors. We seek to understand how modifying, or modding,
existing games can lead to various forms of learning.
Game design can be a powerful motivator for learning complex skills.
For instance, studies of elementary school children who designed
educational games suggested that programming could be a medium for
personal and creative expression as well as helping learners develop
informal notions of mathematical and computational formalisms (Harel,
1991; Kafai, 1994). Learning by designing provides opportunities to
engage in rich problem solving activities that resemble those of expert
game designers.
Unfortunately, designing and implementing games is a daunting task.
Building games with high-level computer languages requires a great deal
of work unrelated to game play, and simpler authoring tools often fail
to provide the realism that learners see in modern video games.
Fortunately, designers began abstracting their games from the
underlying engines that handle graphical rendering, camera control,
lighting and so. These engines allow games to be modified, and
communities of players now routinely alter and share modded games with
others. Modding also involves some degree of learning, but the overhead
of tweaking these game engines is significantly less than other
options, especially if the goal is to produce products that resemble
current, commercial games. More so, we believe that modding can lead to
opportunities to learn by designing.
Presentation
Our session will describe the types of learning that can occur while
modding games, e.g., computer programming, mathematics, physics,
artificial intelligence, and software engineering. We will present
these ideas through case studies of high school and college students{\textquoteright}
modding in classroom settings and qualitative analyses of what they
learned by creating working demonstrations of video games. We will
focus on the curricular activities designed to ease the complexity of
modding game engines and discuss difficulties that emerged during the
courses. Student comments on the degree of effort required to work with
different game engines will also be presented, as those have helped us
to understand how to design modding exercises that promote learning of
various domain skills. In the end, we hope to promote a new direction
for research, in particular promote the research in the design and
development of tools that can emphasize learning by modding.

	journal = {DiGRA 2005 Conference: Changing Views--Worlds in Play},
	year = {2005},
	abstract = {This paper outlines how representations of gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity intersect with strategies of late capitalism in The Sims, arguably the most popular video game of all time. Within an industry known for its social stereotyping, The Sims has been praised as socially progressive for its liberal views towards same-sex relationships, racial equality, and non-sexualized presentation of women. However, I will argue, using the theory of Stuart Hall, Naomi Klein, Henry Jenkins and others, that below its progressive fa{\c c}ade The Sims amounts to an exploitation of diversity initiated by targeting untraditional markets to better tap into the consuming potential of millions of non-white, non-male, non-heterosexual people {\textendash} what Hall sees as the commercial appropriation of difference. I want to suggest that the spike in social liberalism may not be the result of a socio-cultural change in ideology, but instead reflects a change in how traditionally marginalized people are marketed to in late capitalism. The Sims, in this formation, becomes a hybrid entity, fueling both progressive liberal discourse and the relentless pursuit of profit at the expense to those it (mis)represents.},

	abstract = {The massive spread of mobile phones and their social acceptance is an important information-technological feature of the beginning of the 21st century. In addition to making calls, mobile phones are associated with various additional services and games, which are becoming part of everyday life. As the location of mobile phones can be precisely tracked in space, they can be used for investigating the space-time behaviour of society. In this paper we will introduce the Social Positioning Method and its possible applications in the organisation and planning of public life. The Social Positioning Method (SPM) studies social flows in time and space by analysing the location coordinates of mobile phones and the social identification of the people carrying them. So far, relatively few SPM surveys have been carried out-the reason for that is related to people{\textquoteright}s anxieties about the idea of being tracked, as well as technical aspects. In this article we assert that SPM will become very wide-spread in the future and will fundamentally change public life and administration. Due to the widespread use of telephones and the possibilities of social positioning, the questions of privacy and freedom of the individual are already being discussed. Despite this, there has still been only a limited discussion concerning live-map geography and real-time planning in relation to privacy issues. },

Four patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and one patient had partial seizures with secondary generalization. No spontaneous seizure occurred in these patients. Three patients had been receiving antiepileptic drug therapy, butt without effective control over their seizures. Mah-Jong-induced epilepsy is a very peculiar form of complex reflex epilepsy that involves the higher mental activities. This phenomenon may consist of distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms from other reflex epilepsy induced by thinking and spatial tasks in idiopathic generalized epilepsies. This unusual reflex epilepsy is relatively benign in nature and antiepileptic drug therapy has uncertain benefits. It may be necessary to avoid playing the Mah-Jong game in order to prevent seizures. },

	abstract = {Mobile terminals have evolved from basic portable telephones to complex and diverse devices that encompass dozens of other features, ranging from tri-dimensional games to office suites with data transmission capabilities. Variability is value: mobile terminal manufacturers must succeed in fulfilling the requirements of hundreds of mobile telecom operators worldwide, and at the same time increase the value of their brand by adopting a common user interface style while offering the features that the target end-user category desires. This makes for practically infinite variability and creates a business problem. The complexity of the variability problem increases due to issues such as the ability to {\textquoteright}plug and play{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteright}feature descension{\textquoteright} (the down-scaling of high-end features and their introduction into lower-end models). The main lesson we have learned from our experience in this field is that the application of relatively simple architectural patterns usually eases up management of the complexity at the architectural level. However, tackling the variability problem at the technical level is ineffective unless the organization is able to ensure the application of the solutions. We analyze the main challenges that lie behind the variability problem in mobile terminals, at both technical and organizational level, and illustrate some of the solutions we have implemented together with our product developers and system architects. Our experience calls for more applied research in the area of variability management, as well as for a number of enhancements to academic curricula. Copyright \&COPY; 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objectives To describe mass media use in teenagers (television, mobile phones, computers, Internet and video games) and to analyze its influence on teenagers{\textquoteright} health and development. Material and methods We performed a cross sectional study by means of a survey of 884 teenagers aged between 14 and 18 years old who were in the third and fourth years of high school in six towns in Cantabria (Spain) in June 2003. The statistical analysis consisted of uni- and bivariable descriptive statistics. Results All the teenagers had a television set at home and 24\% of families had four or more television sets. The presence of distinct mass media in teenagers{\textquoteright} rooms was 52.5\% for televisions, 57.8\% for computers, 52\% for the Internet and 38.7\% for games consoles. The most frequently found media in teenagers{\textquoteright} bedrooms were radio/cassette players and compact disks with 76.8\% and 67.4\%, respectively. Teenagers watched television for an average of 3 hours per day on weekdays and 3.2 hours per day at weekends. They played games consoles for an average of 0.69 hours per day on weekdays (41 min) and an average of 1.09 hours per day (65 min) at weekends and used the Internet on weekdays for an average of 0.83 hours per day (49 min) and an average of 1.15 hours per day (69 min) at weekends. A total of 87.2\% of the teenagers, especially girls, had a mobile phone (91.6\% of girls versus 82.4\% of boys; p < 0.001). The average age at which teenagers had the first mobile phone was 13 years old. Expenditure on mobile phones amounted to 15 (sic) a month in girls and 10 (sic) a month in boys, and mobiles were mainly used for sending messages. Nearly half the teenagers (46.4\%) took their mobile phones to high school and reported they had an average of three mobile phones at home. Most (82.1\%) surfed the net but boys preferred surfing and downloading games and girls preferred chatting and sending e-mails. Sixty-two percent of teenagers had been to a cybercafe and 40.8\% has visited a pornographic web site, especially boys (33.1\% of boys versus 7.7\% of girls; p < 0.001). Nearly two-thirds of teenagers (71.5\%) had a video console, especially boys (87\% of boys versus 57.2\% of girls; p < 0.001) and they started playing with them at an average age of 8.8 years. Boys preferred video games with shooting, fights, sports and driving, while girls preferred adventure video games. Nearly a quarter (22.2\%) spent money on video games and cybercafes (an average of 27.06 (sic) a month in boys and 16.81 (sic) a month in girls) with no significant differences between sexes. Conclusions Society as a whole and especially health professionals should increase health education on mass media consumption, by stimulating reasonable use of mass media and teaching teenagers to be critical. Parents should set a limit of less than 2 hours/day to the use of mass media and should avoid their presence in teenagers{\textquoteright} bedrooms. Prepay mobile phone should be used and switched off in inappropriate places. Parents should supervise and educate teenagers about video games, Internet access and e-mail usage in adolescence.},

According to TAM, IT adoption is influenced by two perceptions: usefulness and ease of use. In this study, we extend TAM to the mobile commerce context. We categorize the tasks performed on wireless handheld devices into three categories: (1) general tasks that do not involve transactions and gaming, (2) gaming tasks, and (3) transactional tasks. We propose a unified conceptual model for wireless technology adoption. In this model, task type moderates the effects of four possible determinants: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived playfulness, and perceived security. We postulate that, under the mobile context, user intention to perform general tasks that do not involve transactions and gaming is influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, user intention to play games is affected by perceived playfulness, and user intention transact is influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived security. A survey was conducted to collect data about user perception of 12 tasks that could be performed on wireless handheld devices and user intention to use wireless technology. Multiple regression analyses supported the proposed research model.},

	abstract = {Motion capture-based facial animation has recently gained popularity in many applications, such as movies, video games, and human-computer interface designs. With the use of sophisticated facial motions from a human performer, animated characters are far more lively and convincing. However, editing motion data is difficult, limiting the potential of reusing the motion data for different tasks. To address this problem, statistical techniques have been applied to learn models of the facial motion in order to derive new motions based on the existing data. Most existing research focuses on audio-to-visual mapping and reordering of words, or on photo-realistically matching the synthesized face to the original performer. Little attention has been paid to modifying and controlling facial expression, or to mapping expressive motion onto other 3D characters. This article describes a method for creating expressive facial animation by extracting information from the expression axis of a speech performance. First, a statistical model for factoring the expression and visual speech is learned from video. This model can be used to analyze the facial expression of a new performance or modify the facial expressions of an existing performance. With the addition of this analysis of the facial expression, the facial motion can be more effectively retargeted to another 3D face model. The blendshape retargeting technique is extended to include subsets of morph targets that belong to different facial expression groups. The proportion of each subset included in a final animation is weighted according to the expression information. The resulting animation conveys much more emotion than if only the motion vectors were used for retargeting. Finally, since head motion is very important in adding liveness to facial animation, we introduces an audio-driven synthesis technique for generating new head motion.},

The standard version of the task poses special challenges for children, demanding extended concentration and the ability to distinguish targets from identical-looking distractors, and may thus underestimate children{\textquoteright}s tracking abilities. As a result, a modified version of the task called "Catch the Spies" was developed. Participants tracked one to four moving "spies" (targets) that had "disguised" themselves so that they could blend in with a crowd of 10 people (happy-faces). Tracking accuracy was measured in live age groups (6, 8, 10, 12, and 19 years old). All performed well above chance though there were age-related increases in the number that could be tracked at once. Overall, when the effects of age were statistically controlled, tracking performance was significantly better for action videogame players than non-players, and marginally better for action-sports participants than non-participants.},

	abstract = {We propose a new algorithm for distributed power control in cellular communication systems. We define a cost for each mobile that consists of a weighted sum of power and square of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) error and obtain the static Nash equilibrium for the resulting costs. The algorithm requires only interference power measurements and/or SIR measurements from the base station and converges even in cases where limits on available power render the target SIRs unattainable. Examples generated using realistic data demonstrate that, in demanding environments, the Nash equilibrium power provides substantial power savings as compared to the power balancing algorithm while reducing the achieved SIR only slightly. Additional simulations show that the benefit of the Nash equilibrium power control over the power balancing solution increases as the receiver noise power or number of users in the cell increases. The algorithm has the advantage that it can be implemented distributively. An additional benefit of the algorithm is that, based on their chosen cost function, mobiles may choose to "opt out" i.e., stop transmitting, if they determine that the power required to achieve their SIR objectives is more expensive to them than not transmitting at all.},

	abstract = {Objective: The authors examined national trends from 1990 to 2000 in the utilization of community hospital inpatient services by young people (5-20 years of age) with intentional self-inflicted injuries. Method: Discharge abstracts from a nationally representative sample of community hospitals were analyzed, with a focus on youth discharges (N = 10,831) with a diagnosis of intentional self-inflicted injury (ICD-9-CM: E950-E959). Census data were used to derive national population-based rates of self-inflicted injuries requiring inpatient treatment. Overall population-based trends in hospitalizations for self-inflicted injury were calculated and stratified by gender and age. Among youths hospitalized with a self-inflicted injury, trends were also calculated for length of stay, inpatient costs, method of injury, and associated mental disorder diagnoses. Results: The annual hospitalization rate of youths with self-inflicted injuries declined from 49.1 per 100,000 in 1990 to 44.9 per 100,000 in 2000, and the mean length of inpatient stay significantly declined from 3.6 days to 2.7 days. Among the hospitalized patients, there were increases in the rate of cutting (4.3\% to 13.2\%) and ingestion of acetaminophen (22.1\% to 26.9\%), antidepressants (10.0\% to 14.0\%), and opiates (2.3\% to 3.3\%) as a cause of injury, whereas there were decreases in the ingestion of salicylates (14.9\% to 10.2\%) and barbiturates (1.5\% to 0.7\%). There were significant increases in the proportion of subjects with primary mental disorder discharge diagnoses of depressive disorder (29.2\% to 46.0\%), bipolar disorder (1.3\% to 8.2\%), and substance use disorder (5.4\% to 10.7\%) and significant decreases in the rate of adjustment disorders (22.2\% to 11.4\%) and non-mental disorders (31.9\% to 13.6\%). After excluding cutting, which may be more closely related to self-mutilation than suicidal self-injury, the annual hospitalization rate of youths with self-inflicted injuries declined from 47.2 per 100,000 in 1990 to 39.4 per 100,000 in 2000. Conclusions: Over the decade of study, young people admitted to community hospitals with self-inflicted injuries tended to have more severe psychiatric diagnoses and to be treated during shorter inpatient stays. These trends suggest that the role of youth inpatient care has narrowed, becoming focused on those with severe psychiatric disorders.},

To provide a truly rich and realistic experience to students, some form of interdisciplinary or collaborative work is clearly needed as part of their education. Successful games draw upon a diverse set of talents and backgrounds from their creators, and so an interdisciplinary exposure is crucial to students studying games and game development.

These complex entanglements of the proprietary and the non-proprietary, the commercial and the non-commercial, are not necessarily an appropriation of fandom by corporate bottom-line agendas.

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Waist circumference (W) has been shown to be a good predictor of cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to investigate whether physical activity (PA) is related to W in adolescents as previously shown in adults. Design and Subjects: Cross-sectional population-based survey of 2714 12-y-old adolescents from the eastern part of France. MEASUREMENTS: Body mass index (BMI) and W were measured. Structured PA, active commuting to and from school and sedentary activities (SED), for example television viewing, computer/video games and reading and different potential confounders (dietary habits, parental overweight, family annual income tax and educational level) were assessed by a questionnaire. Results: The adolescents had a mean BMI of 19.0+/-3.4 kg/m(2), and 20.2\% of them were overweight, with no gender difference. Boys had a greater W than girls (67.6+/-9.1 vs 65.7+/-8.9 cm, P<0.0001). In all, 42\% of the girls and 25\% of the boys did not practice any structured PA outside school and less than 40\% of the adolescents commuted actively to school more than 20 min/day. About one-third of the adolescents devoted more than 2 h/day to SED. In univariate analyses, BMI was negatively associated with structured PA but significantly only for girls (P<0.01) and positively associated with SED for both genders (P<0.0001 for girls, P<0.01 for boys). W was negatively associated with structured PA and positively associated with SED both in girls (P<0.0001 and P=0.03, respectively) and boys (P<0.01 and P=0.08, respectively). Multiple general linear models show that SED is associated with BMI, independently of structured PA, in both genders. On the other hand, structured PA was inversely associated with W, independently of SED. The inverse relation between structured PA and W persisted after additional adjustment on BMI, with a greater effect of PA for the adolescents with higher BMI. Conclusions: In 12-y-old adolescents, structured PA is inversely associated with W, an indicator of total adiposity but also more specifically of abdominal fat. This suggests that PA may have a beneficial effect on youth metabolic and cardiovascular risks, in particular in the presence of overweight.},

	abstract = { Talking about games refers in today{\textquoteright}s world often to the play of audio-visual computer games. Since their first introduction in the 1960s, computer games have evolved in many ways and are today one of the fastest growing industries. Besides the classic visual games, another niche has emerged over the last decade: audio-only computer games. The main difference to conventional games is that these games can only be played and perceived through sound and acoustics. Although, initially developed by and for the visually impaired community, these games posses huge potentials for mobile (transportable) gaming and can be enjoyed by all hearing. In this work we present an overview of audio-only games, and discuss the methods and techniques to play and design such auditory worlds. We further explore the evolved genres and address the advantages, as well as the limitations of audio based gaming. Our work is motivated by our own research in this area and the development of a framework, which allows an easy design and setup of audio-only computer games.},

	abstract = {Videogames now enable players to spend virtual fortunes on exotic virtual goods and even create and sell virtual artefacts. Online consumers may also browse endlessly through virtual marketplaces and create and display virtual goods. These virtual commodities are desired and enjoyed as if they were real, but are not actually bought, or owned in a material sense {\textendash} often resulting in frustration amongst marketers. In this paper we account for virtualised consumption by highlighting its pleasures. We start by historicising the trend towards imaginary consumption practices, depicting virtual consumption as the latest stage in an ongoing transformation of consumption from a focus on utility through to emotional value, sign value and finally playful experience. Viewed from this perspective, we consider the role of emerging virtual consumption spaces as liminoid, transformational play-spaces and explore examples of consumer practices found in these spaces. Ultimately we argue that virtual spaces encourage the development of new consumption practices and therefore constitute the ability of the market to stimulate consumers{\textquoteright} imaginations in new and exciting ways based on digital play.},

	abstract = {Computer Graphics (CG) animations of natural phenomena are currently widely used for movies and in video games. Granular materials occur widely in nature, and therefore it is necessary that CG animations represent ground surfaces composed of a granular material as well as model deformations when the granular material comes into contact with other physical rigid objects (called solid objects). In this paper, we propose a deformation algorithm for ground surfaces composed of granular material. The deformation algorithm is divided into three steps: (1) detection of the collision between a solid object and the ground surface, (2) displacement of the granular material and (3) erosion of the material at steep slopes. The proposed algorithm can handle solid objects of various shapes, including concave polyhedra by additionally using a layered data structure called the Height Span Map. Furthermore, a texture sliding technique is presented to render the motion of granular materials. In addition, our implementation of the deformation algorithm can be used at interactive frame rates.},

To measure problem use, the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale was devised and validated as a reliable self-report instrument, against the Addiction Potential Scale and overall mobile phone usage levels. Problem use was a function of age, extraversion, and low self-esteem, but not neuroticism. As extraverts are more likely to take risks, and young drivers feature prominently in automobile accidents, this study supports community concerns about mobile phone use, and identifies groups that should be targeted in any intervention campaigns.},

Interaction of fluids with rigid bodies is important because fluids and rigid bodies move influencing each other. Fluid simulation based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is useful for rendering a visually plausible behaviour of fluids. However, due to the high computational cost of CFD, real-time rendering of fluids needs a fast simulation. This paper describes the particle-based fluid simulation based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics which includes interactions between fluids and rigid bodies, its fast implementation, and the manner of rendering a realistic water surface with optical phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and the Fresnel effect. The proposed method enables real-time animation of water with rigid body interaction.

Yet, if game characters could learn through interacting with the player, behavior could improve as the game is played, keeping it interesting. This paper introduces the real-time Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (rtNEAT) method for evolving increasingly complex artificial neural networks in real time, as a game is being played. The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible an entirely new genre of video games in which the player trains a team of agents through a series of customized exercises. To demonstrate this concept, the Neuroevolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game was built based on rtNEAT. In NERO, the player trains a team of virtual robots for combat against other players{\textquoteright} teams. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and demonstrates that rtNEAT makes possible video games like NERO where agents evolve and adapt in real time. In the future, rtNEAT may allow new kinds of educational and training applications through interactive and adapting games.},

Design: Feasibility study. Settings: Community kindergartens around Israel and a tertiary pediatric pulmonary clinic. Participants: Healthy and asthmatic preschool children (age range, 2.0 to 6.5 years). Intervention: Multitarget interactive spirometry games including three targets: full inspiration before expiration, instant forced expiration, an long expiration to residual volume. Measurements and results: One hundred nine healthy, and 157 asthmatic children succeeded in performing adequate spirometry using a multitarget interactive spirometry game. American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory, Society spirometry criteria for adults for the start of the test, and repeatability were met. Expiration time increased with age (1.3 +/- 0.3 s at 3 years to 1.9 +/- 0.3 s at 6 years [+/- SD], p < 0.05). FVC and flow rates increased with age, while FEV1/FVC decreased. Healthy children had FVC and FEV1 values similar to those of previous preschool studies, but flows were significantly higher (> 1.5 SD for forced expiratory flow at 50\% of vital capacity [FEF50] and forced expiratory flow at 75\% of vital capacity, [FEF75] p < 0005). The descending part of the flow/volume curve was convex in 2.5- to 3.5-year-old patients, resembling that of infants, while in 5- to 6-year-old patients, there was linear decay. Asthma severity by Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines correlated with longer expiration time (1.7 +/- 0.4 s; p < 0.03) and lower FEF50 (32 to 63\%; p < 0.001) compared to healthy children. Bronchodilators improved FEV1 by 10 to 13\% and FEF50 by 38 to 56\% of baseline. Conclusions: Interactive respiratory games can facilitate spirometry in very young children, yielding results that conform to most of the ATS criteria established for adults and published data for healthy preschool children. Spirometric indexes correlated with degree of asthma severity.},

	abstract = {The concept of a ludic systems encompasses a family of media forms and experiences involving elements of simulation, game play and narrative or story construction. These three elements can be regarded as different classes of semiotic systems, or systems of meaning, having their own structuring principles and methods of informing experience. For any particular ludic system, such as a computer game, time structure can be considered in terms of a number of distinct layers of meaning analogous to the levels of encoding identified in structuralist narrative theory: a generation level, a simulation level, a performance level and a discourse level. The simulation, performance and discourse levels correspond to the semiotic domains of simulations, games and narratives. For any specific ludic system, the overall design approach relating to how the designer intends the players{\textquoteright} experience to be structured, as the core of interactive engagement and immersion, can be based upon emphasizing one of these three primary forms, or integrating more than one form by various strategies. Adopting a structural semiotic approach to modeling these layers of meaning provides a foundation for more clearly integrating design choices within a coherent overall concept, as well as laying the foundations for a more systematic study of possible correlations between design features and player affects.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe how geometrically correct and visually realistic shadows may be computed for objects composited into a single view of a target scene. Compared to traditional single view compositing methods, which either do not deal with the shadow effects or manually create the shadows for the composited objects, our approach efficiently utilizes the geometric and photometric constraints extracted from a single target image to synthesize the shadows consistent with the overall target scene for the inserted objects. In particular, we explore (i) the constraints provided by imaged scene structure, e.g. vanishing points of orthogonal directions, for camera calibration and thus explicit determination of the locations of the camera and the light source; (ii) the relatively weaker geometric constraint, the planar homology, that models the imaged shadow relations when explicit camera calibration is not possible; and (iii) the photometric constraints that are required to match the color characteristics of the synthesized shadows with those of the original scene. For each constraint, we demonstrate the working examples followed by our observations. To show the accuracy and the applications of the proposed method, we present the results for a variety of target scenes, including footage from commercial Hollywood movies and 3D video games.},

In this context, like-minded people can converse and interact online in ways that are both enjoyable and satisfying. However, virtual worlds also bring with them cause for concern. These concerns include but are not limited to - the loss of one{\textquoteright}s privacy, the fear of being exploited, and the loss of identity. This paper seeks to investigate the cur-rent state of affairs of online virtual worlds in terms of what many people deem acceptable and unacceptable forms of behavior. Design/methodology/approach - A study is presented that explores the unmonitored distribution of electronic materials through the internet. Available technologies are surveyed and recommendations made based on these analyses. Findings - This paper has shown that effective enforcement of online behavior is, at least, a very complicated undertaking - not one that will be quickly or easily solved. However, it demonstrates a number of techniques people may use today to protect themselves and those around them. Originality/value - A number of techniques are described to help people traverse virtual worlds in a safe secure and confident manner.

	abstract = {This paper describes the preliminary research of an ambient intelligent system known as socio-ec(h)o. socio-ec(h)o explores the design and implementation of an ambient intelligent system for sensing and display, user modeling, and interaction models based on game structures. Our interaction model is based on a game structure including levels, body states, goals and game skills. Body states are the body movements and positions that players must discover in order to complete a level and in turn represent a learned game skill. The paper provides an overview of background concepts and related research. We describe the game structure and prototype of our environment. We discuss games research concepts we utilized and our approach to group user models based on Richard Bartle{\textquoteright}s game types. We explain the role of embodied cognition within our design and elaborate on what we chose to encode as embodied actions, cognition and communication. We describe how we utilized selective responses that were real-time, gradient, provided rewards and were unique to different group user models. We introduce our approach to designing ambient intelligent systems that is ecologically inspired. We stress the empirical nature of the design work and the role of participatory design in developing our system.},

By recognizing the new interplay of actors that extends from design time well into play time we attempt to transcend the technological determinism of approaches that focus on technological devices as determinants of the game experience. Using Actor-Network Theory constructs we propose an alternative perspective that takes context as the development object and technical artifacts, social and game rules, roles, playing and organizational strategies and practices as media designed to influence the emergence of the heterogeneous sociotechnical networks governing online game experiences. Finally, we outline challenges for the innovation of designer and player roles.},

Design/methodology/approach - The objective was achieved by means of a semiotic approach to the medium under discussion. The subject scope of the paper was further developed and supported by an overview of existing case studies related to the topic. Based on the aforementioned analysis and on original ideas, new concepts and strategies on the subject are proposed. Findings - The videogame medium has excellent potential for promotion, marketing and educational applications. Moreover, spin-off applications in the field of simulation-based research can also be envisioned. The proposed concepts, although specifically referring to the space sector, are applicable to many other industrial and non-industrial fields, including libraries. Practical implications - The paper hints at many possible spin-off applications for videogames in the field of communication, marketing and simulation-based research. Originality/value - The concepts proposed in the paper outline novel marketing and outreach strategies (together with other spin-off applications) based on a rather underestimated medium, i.e. the videogame, which has yet to receive proper attention from scholars.},

	abstract = {With pervasive gaming, novel types of games have recently emerged. The idea is to apply pervasive computing technology - which embeds computers in real-world, everyday environments - to games. By bringing gaming back to natural, social interaction spaces, pervasive gaming aims to overcome some restrictions of conventional computer games: Players are no longer tied to computer screens and human-human interaction is not constrained by graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which is a crucial aspect of traditional non-computer games. Our approach to pervasive gaming also builds on tangible user interfaces (TUIs) where players interact with the game environment by physically grasping and moving real-world objects. In this paper, we propose a simple and cost-effective, but efficient and powerful approach to tangible and pervasive gaming based on Phidgets. The framework, as well as two example games, have been developed as part of a Game Design course at the ISNM.},

	abstract = {A simple and yet highly efficient, high-quality texture mapping method for surfaces of arbitrary topology is presented. The new method projects the given surface from the 3D object space into the 2D texture space to identify the 2D texture structure that will be used to texture the surface. The object space to texture space projection is optimized to ensure minimum distortion of the texture mapping process. The optimization is achieved through a commonly used norm preserving minimization process on edges of the surface. The main difference here is, by using an initial value approach, the optimization problem can be set up as a quadratic programming problem and, consequently, solved by a linear least squares method. Three methods to choose a good initial value are presented. Test cases show that the new method works well on surfaces of arbitrary topology, with the exception of surfaces with exceptionally abnormal curvature distribution. Other advantages of the new method include uniformity and seamlessness of the texture mapping process. The new method is suitable for applications that do not require precise texture mapping results but demand highly efficient mapping process such as computer animation or video games.},

Scholars, practitioners, unions, and organizations have therefore begun to explore whether there are alternative approaches to reduce counterproductive behaviors at work. We investigated the perceptions of labor relations experts, drivers of transportation vehicles, and users of public transportation services toward drug and impairment testing programs in the workplace. Impairment testing was viewed as more favorable in terms of combating and controlling counterproductive behaviors at work than drug testing. Perceptions of fairness, effectiveness in detecting impaired performance, and the potential to enhance a safer working environment were higher in the impairment testing condition as compared to the drug testing condition. Perceived invasiveness was lower in the impairment testing condition relative to the drug testing condition. Labor relations experts showed the least enthusiasm for both drug testing and impairment testing programs.},

	abstract = {User toolkits for innovation were recently proposed as a means to eliminate (costly) exchange of need-related information between users and manufactures in the product development process. The method transfers certain development tasks to users and thereby empowers them to create their own desired product features. This article examines the implications of different levels of opportunities for consumer involvement (OCI) in product development to learn what happens when firms pass design tasks on to consumers. It explores this issue by studying the relation between the employment of user toolkits and the need for firms to support their consumers. An analysis of 78 computer games products and the amount of support given by firms to the consumers of these products suggests that a share of the costs firms save on information acquisition by letting consumers "do it themselves" may eventually reemerge as costs in consumer support. In other words, an increase in opportunities for consumer involvement seems to increase the need for supporting consumers. A promising solution to the problem of support costs is identified, namely, the establishment of consumer-consumer support interaction. A case study of an outlier in terms of firm support to consumers-Westwood Studios-shows that consumers who use toolkits may be willing to support each other. Such interactive problem solving in a firm-established user community is advantageous to the firm, because the process reduces the amount of resources that the firm itself needs to dedicate to the support of consumers using toolkits. Generally, consumer-to-consumer interaction can facilitate problem-solving in the consumer domain, can aid the diffusion of toolkit related knowledge, and potentially can enhance the outcomes produced by the toolkit approach.},

Judith Butler{\textquoteright}s notion of performativity is used alongside a multimodal theory of sign-making to argue that the way students interpret and produce texts is socially motivated to achieve a certain subjectivity within the context of the classroom and the peer group.

This paradigm can be inefficient (inadequate computer power distribution) or it can produce incorrect simulations (disordered events execution or events lost). The use of a decoupled discrete paradigm avoids incorrect simulations, besides it improves the simulation quality and efficiency. GDESK is a discrete decoupled simulation kernel that can be integrated in any videogame or real-time graphic application to change its simulation paradigm to a discrete decoupled one. Once GDESK is integrated inside the videogame, it becomes into a set of objects being communicated by messages. Messages are modeled using discrete events. GDESK manages the messages exchange process (events synchronization, messages sending and reception process, etc.). },

In addition to providing the individual with potential psychological benefits, identification with an online self or avatar can also increase individual and social understanding and tolerance of difference. The ability to create a character, or avatar, that can be identified with is the initial, and arguably the most important, step in the process of identification. However, this process has changed significantly with the advent and development of visually oriented games. Through participant-observation conducted in World of Warcraft and textual analysis of online forums associated with the game, this paper investigates the ways in which visual elements of online games affect the process of identifying with an online self. Ultimately, it argues that although interacting in a virtual environment where everything is immediately visible can ease the identification process, limits on character appearance, movement, and interaction imposed by visually rendering the game could simultaneously compromise this benefit.

	journal = {DiGRA 2005 Conference: Changing Views--Worlds in Play},
	year = {2005},
	abstract = {Video game was the first truly digital entertainment medium, requiring processing power both in the production and consumption stage. Born out of the transistor, it was also intimately connected with its logic: the doubling of the processor capacity every 18th month or the halving of the price for the same processing capacity in the same time. Transistor technology and video games have been able to conquer society in an evolutionary process. Hence, video games have had an unprecedented ability to conquer new platforms and incorporate new technologies. In this regard it is the foremost example that growth of a medium succeeds not by digital convergence but digital divergence (1). What started out on a mainframe has later moved to the arcade, the home console, handhelds, the personal computer, and the mobile phone. The development of new platforms has made gaming experience possible trough a more diversified market that incorporate a larger part of our life (work, home, travel time, leisure time) and economic segments. Today, games are available on five different platforms (2), in some cases these different platforms have been non-competitive in the sense that they have complemented each other (such as the handheld and the console), in other cases they have been competitive to a large degree (e.g. the console and the PC). The game mediums{\textquoteright} unique ability to utilize and adapt to different platform makes it metaphorical to its nature. For every gaming platform, games have developed its own expression and the platform diversification in itself has also been one of the reasons behind the long term viability and growth of the game industry; when one platform for various reasons has stagnated, another platform has been able to continue to innovate. The development of hardware has also changed the nature of games and gamers from a socio-cultural point of view. When the main gaming market moved from the arcade to the home console market, adventures with developed characters became possible. When the CD-ROM was introduced to the console market with Playstation and Sega Saturn, the ability to incorporate music, video and high quality pictures made lifestyle oriented games possible that could follow different cultural trends. The evolution of communication technology made different kind of online games possible, making games a social experience. The move from the arcade to the home meant, from a sociological point of view, that the group of players became more diverse. People who previously would or could not play computer games due to the fact that the games were placed in public meeting places mostly dominated by young males, could now enter the game worlds from home: elderly people, children, and women. Recent surveys of Massively Multi-Player Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) (3) show, for example, that the average age of players is unexpectedly high, and that a comparatively large fraction of the players are women. The domestication of computer games also led to a higher degree of social complexity in- and outside the games. In addition to the interaction with players in the game the home backdrop allows interaction with family members and friends physically present. The use of home communication technologies for gaming purposes increases the interaction complexity further. The result is a multi-faceted and simultaneous on- and offline interaction process. Object Our paper explores how the shifts and diversification of video game platforms have affected both the industry, as well as its socioeconomic context. We argue that the technological development in primarily processing capacity and later on storage capacity and communication technologies profoundly has changed the comparative advantages of different business model over the history of video games. The nature of this transformation can explain the shift in industrial leadership for companies producing hardware, as well as the outcomes of the battle between firms from different industries competing for this leadership. The paper will study the hardware and industry system in three major periods, the Atari era, the Nintendo era and the Sony era. Each period has had its own market logic and the shift has been unexpected but fast, regardless of the strong position held by the dominant firm. As digital technology has transformed boundaries between industries, firms from many earlier separated industries have entered the game hardware market. Repeatedly, the disruptive nature of technology has changed the competitive marketplace. Industrial leaders have been unable to change when the technological development has transformed the competitive advantages of different business models. To a large degree, the situation resembles what has been described as {\textquotedblleft}the innovator{\textquoteright}s dilemma{\textquotedblright} (4). We argue that the proliferation of platforms have been essential to the evolution of the video game industry. When one platform stagnated, new forms of software could evolve in entirely unexpected places. The multitude of platforms made it possible to overcome tendencies of stagnation. It has also made it harder for dominant actors to monopolize or control the market. Technology has always found a way to slip through. The recent emergence of on-line gaming has increased the room for innovation in several unexpected ways. Indeed, it has added a new dimension to gaming. As communities evolve around games an interactive social context is added. The effects of Metcalfe{\textquoteright}s law are added to Moore{\textquoteright}s law, and a vast expanse of innovative possibilities is created. The new social context of gaming might call for a very different kind of entrepreneurial capabilities. (1) Jenkins, H. (2001) {\textquotedblright}Convergence?

A number of legitimate interests on part of both producers and gamers may be readily distinguished. More complex distributions of rights would allow many of these interests to be consistently respected.},

In order toease the fulfillment of these goals, software engineering techniques andmethodologies have started to be used during game development. However,the use of such techniques and the creation of AI middleware are still farfrom being a generic and flexible enough tool for developing this kind ofapplication. Another important factor to be mentioned in this discussion isthe lack of available literature related to studies in this field.This dissertation discusses the research effort in developing a flexiblearchitecture that can be applied to diferent game styles, provides supportfor several game AI functionalities and serves as basis for the introductionof more powerful techniques that can improve gameplay and user experience.This work presents: design issues of such system and its integration withgames; a study on AI middleware architecture for games; an analysisof the state-of-the-art in the field; and a survey of the availablerelevant literature. Taking this research as starting point, the design andimplementation of the proposed AI middleware architecture was conductedand is also described here. Besides the implementation itself, a study on theuse of design patterns in the context of the development and evolution ofan AI framework for digital games is also presented.

But, in real-time video games there are multiple cooperative and adversarial agents. While the search space in most games is relatively small, algorithms are expected to plan in mere milliseconds. Thus, techniques such as abstraction are needed to effectively reason and act in these worlds. We provide an overview of the research we have completed in this area, as well as areas of current and future work.},

	abstract = {This study aims to identify design features for action games that would appeal to game-buyers, rather than game-players. Sixteen frequent-buyers of computer games identified 39 design features that appeal to buyers by contrasting different versions of Pacman games. Twenty-eight versions of Pacman were then evaluated in terms of the identified design features by 45 participants ( 27 male and 18 female college students). Qnet2000 neural network software was used to determine the relative importance of these design features. The results indicated that the top 10 most important design features could account for more than 50\% of "perceived fun" among these 39 design features. The feature of avatar is important to game-buyers, yet not revealed in previous player-oriented studies. Moreover, six design factors underlying the 39 features were identified through factor analysis. These factors included "novelty and powerfulness,""appealing presentation,""interactivity,""challenging,""sense of control," and " rewarding," and could account for 54\% of total variance. Among these six factors, appealing presentation has not been emphasized by player-oriented research. Implications of the findings were discussed.},

The first adaptation resolves the physical difference between the authoring environment and playback environment. The second adaptation resolves some events that cannot support on mobile devices. The last adaptation resolves the load for restricted resource on mobile device. In view of the results of the performance analysis on the player, we could find that the player showed an efficient playback of MPEC-4 contents on a mobile device.

Yet, where the wishes of players diverge from those of game publishers, the legal and ethical interests of players remain unclear. The most applicable set of legal principles are those of copyright law, which is often grounded in utilitarian justifications, but which may also be justified on deontological grounds. Past copyright cases involving video arcade and per-sonal computer gaming suggest that the gaming scenaria generated by players may constitute original selec-tion and arrangement of the game elements, thus qualifying such gaming sequences for copyright protection as either derivative works or works of joint authorship. But this result may be difficult to justify on utilitarian theories. Rather, the personal investment of game players suggests a deontological basis for claims of game sequence ownership.},

From the 200 videogames collected, we chose 14, following the principle of the two most cited for each of the seven emotions. These videogames were then tested with 33 subjects. These results were compared with Gross \& Levenson (1995) study on movies. We found that these videogames were capable of successfully eliciting emotions such as Surprise, Anger, Disgust and Fear, There is also evidence that Happiness could be elicited. It was not possible to verify the existence of Tranquility. The most problematic was Sadness, except when interactivity was absent and emotion propelled through cutscenes(1).},

In 2003, for example, smart phones represented about 3 percent of the 500 million mobile phones sold worldwide, with analysts expecting their sales to grow at triple-digit year-over-year rates. More than half of the 600 million mobile phones sold in 2004 included a color display and digital camera. The implementation of more advanced features such as accelerated 2D and 3D graphics, videoconferencing, mobile multimedia, and games has raised performance requirements. The same holds true for other digital entertainment devices. Rapid advances in semiconductor technology, microarchitectures, and embedded systems have made the adoption of these features possible. As a result, software complexity will continue to increase to keep pace with overall system complexities. Performance and quality provide good starting points for evaluating a digital entertainment system, but energy consumption is an equally important metric.},

	abstract = {Observing purely reactive situations in modern computer games, one can see that in many cases few, simple rules are sufficient to perform well in the game. In spite of this, the programming of an artificial opponent is still a hard and time consuming task in the way it is done for the most games today. In this paper we propose a system in which no direct programming of the behaviour of the opponents is necessary. Instead, rules are gained by observing human players and then evaluated and optimised by an evolutionary algorithm to optimise the behaviour. We will show that only little learning effort is required to be competitive in reactive situations. In the course of our experiments our system proved to generate better artificial players than the original ones supplied with the game.},

Extended Behavior Networks (EBNs) are a class of action selection architectures capable of selecting a good set of actions for complex agents situated in continuous and dynamic environments. They have been successfully applied to the Robocup, but never before used in computer games, We verify the quality of the action selection mechanism and its correctness in a series of experiments. Then we asses the performance of an agent using an EBN against a plain reactive agent with identical sensory-motor apparatus and against a totally different agent built around finite-state machines. We discuss the results of our experiments, point our future work and conclude that extended behavior networks are a good control mechanism for game agents.},

As an alternative, the extractive and the reactive approaches are incremental, offering moderate costs and risks, and therefore sometimes may be more appropriate. However, combining these two approaches demands a more detailed process at the implementation level. This paper presents a method for extracting a product line and evolving it, relying on a strategy that uses refactorings expressed in terms of simpler programming laws. The approach is evaluated with a case study in the domain of games for mobile devices, where variations are handled with aspect-oriented constructs.},

The question then becomes, how does the quest structure influence the story structure? How do the limitations of the quest combinations limit the kinds of story that are possible? How rich can the imposed story be, without breaking the gameplay? Are landscape and quest-structure the dominant factors in quest game design, to which the story-ambitions must defer? The main thesis of the paper is that if we understand the powerful but simple structure - the grammar - of quests (how they work, how they are used) we can understand both the limits and the potential of these kinds of games.},

	abstract = {Many computer games use custom scripts to control the ambient behaviors of non-player characters (NPCs). Therefore, a story writer must write fragments of computer code for the hundreds or thousands of NPCs in the game world. The challenge is to create entertaining and non-repetitive behaviors for the NPCs without investing substantial programming effort to write custom non-trivial scripts for each NPC. Current computer games have simplistic ambient behaviors for NPCs; it is rare for NPCs to interact with each other. In this paper, we describe how generative behavior patterns can be used to quickly and reliably generate ambient behavior scripts that are believable, entertaining and non-repetitive, even for the more difficult case of interacting NPCs. We demonstrate this approach using BioWare{\textquoteright}s Neverwinter Nights game.},

In this paper we consider a tactical sub-problem that needs to be addressed on the way to strong computer generated forces: abstract combat games in which a small number of inhomogeneous units battle with each other in simultaneous move rounds until all members of one group are eliminated. We present and test several adversarial heuristic search algorithms that are able to compute reasonable actions in those scenarios using short time controls. Tournament results indicate that a new algorithm for simultaneous move games which we. call "randomized alpha-beta search" (RAB) can be used effectively in the abstract combat application we consider. In this application it outperforms the other algorithms we implemented. We. also show that RAB{\textquoteright}s performance is correlated with the degree of simultaneous move interdependence present in the game.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the interaction forms of a contemporary multiplayer game in order to offer implications for multiplayer game design. The motivation for the research originates from the fact that the lack of intuitive and perceivable interaction cues is one of the distinctive features separating networked game settings from face-to-face encounters. The analysis of the interaction forms in multiplayer game sessions indicates that the players can use various forms of non- verbal communication and perceivable actions to reduce communication difficulties. However, players still tend to communicate outside the game system and they try to overcome the limitations of the systems by inventing various imaginative ways to communicate, co-ordinate and co -operate. The findings of this study support the earlier research conducted within the field. However, the improvements in game technologies have been able to slightly reduce the problems of net gaming. Nevertheless, game designers need to take versatile interaction form support into account when designing and developing multiplayer games. It is mainly perceivable and holistic manifestations of interaction that enable players to fully collaborate and cooperate in networked game settings.},

	abstract = {Virtual environments (VEs) are now becoming a promising new technology to be used in the development of interactive learning environments for children. Perhaps triggered by the success of computer games, VEs are seen as an emergent and engaging new way by which children can learn experimental sciences and other disciplines. Inhabiting these IVEs can be agents or intelligent characters that are responsible for events that happen in the environment and make it not predictive or completely controlled. However, to build such environments, in particular, if populated by synthetic characters, one needs to carefully address the problem of how do the learners respond to the characters in the virtual environment. Do learners like the characters? Do learners identify themselves with characters in virtual environments? This relation between learners and characters in virtual environments can be studied in several perspectives. In this paper, we will focus primarily on the issue of empathy as one desirable aspect of the affective interaction between learners and synthetic characters. In particular, we will defend that in order for such affective relations to happen, characters should be created and designed taking into account what we call the proximity factor. This is based on the fact that children are found to respond more empathically to those that are perceived as similar to the self than those who are perceived as dissimilar (Barnett 1987). This appears to be the case when similarity is defined in terms of a shared characteristic, such as sex (Bryant 1982), race or in terms of shared personal experiences ( Bryant 1982). Thus, designing characters aiming at pedagogical empathic interactions, we should carefully address how close the learner will feel with the synthetic characters developed in terms of situation, behavior or even physical appearance. In order to illustrate this factor in eliciting emotional reactions to synthetic characters, we will present a specific system called FearNot!. FearNot! was developed to address the difficult and often devastating problem of bullying in schools. By using role-playing and synthetic characters in a 3D environment, FearNot! allows children from age 8 to 12 to experience a virtual scenario where they can witness ( in a third-person perspective) bullying situations. To build empathy into FearNot, we have considered the following components: agent{\textquoteright}s architecture, the characters{\textquoteright} embodiment, the environment itself, and emotionally charged situations. All these elements were built to allow for a stronger proximity with the user and the system. In this paper, we will focus primarily on this problem and report some results achieved in the evaluation executed with 127 children and 95 adults on the system.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Literacy plays an important role in the development of language in school-age children and adolescents. For example, by reading a variety of books, magazines, and newspapers, students gain exposure to complex vocabulary, and reading becomes a prime opportunity for learning new words. Despite the importance of reading for lexical development, little is known about the pleasure reading habits of today{\textquoteright}s youth. The first goal of this investigation was to examine the preferences of older children and young adolescents with respect to reading as a leisure-time activity and its relationship to other free-time options that are likely to compete for their attention. The second goal was to examine the amount of time that young people spend reading for pleasure each day and the types of materials they most enjoy reading. The third goal was to determine if preferences for free-time activities and reading materials would evince age- and gender-related differences during the period of development from late childhood through early adolescence (ages 11-15 years). The findings could serve as a reference point for understanding what is reasonable to expect of students during this age range. Method: The participants were too sixth graders (mean age = 11;7 [years;months]) and 100 ninth graders (mean age 14;8) attending public schools in western Oregon. Each group contained an equal number of boys and girls, all of whom spoke English as their primary language and were considered to be typical achievers. All participants completed a survey concerning their preferred free-time activities and reading materials. They also reported the average amount of time they spent reading for pleasure each day. 3,000 words per year (Nagy \& Scott, 2000; White, Power, \& White, 1989), resulting in a working knowledge of at least 40,000 different words by the senior year of high school (Nagy \& Herman, 1987). One factor promoting this. Results: The most popular free-time activities were listening to music/going to concerts, watching television or videos, playing sports, and playing computer or video games. Least preferred activities were cooking, running or walking, writing, and arts and crafts. Reading was moderately popular. The most popular reading materials were magazines, novels, and comics; least popular were plays, technical books, and newspapers. Interest in pleasure reading declined during this age range (11-15 years), and boys were more likely than girls to report that they spent no time reading for pleasure. Clinical Implications: Given the importance of reading to lexical development in school-age children and adolescents, reading should be promoted as a leisure activity during these years. School-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs), in their role as language consultants, can benefit from understanding the pleasure-reading patterns of today{\textquoteright}s youth. It is especially important for SLPs to monitor these patterns in students who have language disorders, as it is common for these young people to experience deficits in reading and in lexical development. Fortunately, much can be done in school settings to encourage strong literacy habits in all students if SLPs work collaboratively with teachers, principals, psychologists, librarians, parents, and students. Suggestions are offered for ways to encourage young people to spend more time reading for pleasure.},

In interactive story environments, characters do not merely stand in one position, they should be able to compose gestures and locomotion based on the discourse of the story and other object locations in the scene. Thus in this paper, we propose a conversational locomotion model for virtual characters. We constructed a conversational locomotion network for a virtual environment. A multi-pass searching algorithm calculates the optimal walking path, which uses node activation from the story locations and conversation units. The character also locally adjusts its position so that it does not limit the referenced object from the user{\textquoteright}s sight. We have applied our technique to the interactive 3D movie system, and demonstrated the composite motion of the character{\textquoteright}s locomotion and conversation thus strengthens the immersion in the story environment.},

While some simulators can produce strong vibro-tactile sensations, discrimination of several tactile patterns can remain quite poor. Currently used actuators, such as shaking motor, have also technological and methodological restrictions. We designed a vibro-tactile pen and software to create tactons and semantic sequences of vibro-tactile patterns on mobile devices (iPAQ pocket PC). We proposed special games and techniques to simplify learning and manipulating vibro-tactile patterns. The technique for manipulating vibro-tactile sequences is based on gesture recognition and spatial-temporal mapping for imaging vibro-tactile signals. After training, the tactons could be used as awareness cues or the system of non-verbal communication signals.},

Typical application areas are training applications and simulations, infotainment systems - e.g. in cars - or computer games. However, there is still a lack of tailored concepts for a structured development of this kind of application. The current paper proposes a modeling approach for the user interface of multimedia applications with the goal of a model-driven development. We identify the special properties of multimedia application development and the resulting aspects to be covered by the user interface model. Existing conventional user interface modeling approaches are not sufficient, as they do not cover the media-specific aspects of the application. However, a multimedia application usually includes conventional user interface elements as well. Thus, we first propose a solution for the media-specific part. Second, we elaborate an integration of our approach with existing conventional approaches. Finally, we discuss the overall model-driven development approach and outline its benefits.},

The issues tackled range from user interaction issues to graphics quality to bandwidth constraints. The paper also aims to present different configurations depending on the type of game to be created and a strategy for network gaming using heterogeneous devices focusing on the development of a game that allows users of mobile devices and desktop computers to interact and compete on a single domain. Design/methodology/approach - A tank battle game was developed that plays the same game across both a mobile device such as a phone/PDA and a desktop counterpart. Findings - Although there is a sacrifice in the richness of the game environment on mobile devices, it is possible to develop games that play across platforms and devices, and safeguards can be put in place in order not to overly handicap players using mobile devices. Research limitations/implications - The research focused on a single type of game. It would be ideal to attempt such work on other game genres or platforms. The implications of such work would be that the ubiquity of game play could be extended and the overall gaming experience improved. Originality/value - This paper allows game developers to rethink the possibilities as they develop new games.},

To estimate the next state of a target, a game agent observes its surrounding and learns from these observations. Several agents can communicate to share information in order to find the target efficiently.Particle filtering has been widely applied in game AI, because it is an e{\textpm}cient, nonparametric method to learn from observations and is effective even for nonlinear, non-Gaussian state space distribution. In this project, I apply particle filters on state estimation for each individual game agent and on the communication in multi-agent settings.

	abstract = {There is a need for systematic, research-based and tested game design methodologies that take the needs and preferences of different players into better consideration than the current industry practices. In order to investigate the future of pervasive game playing on mobile devices the University of Tampere Hypermedia Laboratory{\textquoteright}s research project Wireless Gaming Solutions for the Future (MOGAME) has developed a prototype of a persistent multiplayer game. Rather than starting from the research team{\textquoteright}s own game preferences or by analyzing or imitating existing games, the team decided to commence the game design process by researching different "real players" and their preferences. The player study used gameplay scenarios that were presented to the informants in a comic strip format. After analysis, the key findings were summarized into design requirements that were then adopted as goals for the game design. A player-centred game design approach like this can be laborious and has its challenges, but it also provided useful information and inspiration for design. Thus, we argue that players should be more involved in game design and development than is currently typical. This paper describes and evaluates the experiences gathered while using a scenario-based player study to inform pervasive mobile game design.},

In this paper we argue that spoken dialogue technology have the potential to greatly enrichen the user{\textquoteright}s experience in future computer games. We also present some requirements that have to be fulfilled to successfully integrate spoken dialogue technology with a computer game application. Finally, we briefly describe an implemented system that has provided computer game characters with some conversational abilities that kids have interacted with in studies.},

	abstract = {It is often believed that reusable solutions, being generic, must necessarily compromise performance. In this paper, we consider a family of Role-Playing Games (RPGs). We analyzed similarities and differences among four RPGs. By applying a reuse technique of XVCL, we built an RPG product line architecture (RPG-PLA) from which we could derive any of the four RPGs. We built into the RPG-PLA a number of performance optimization strategies that could benefit any of the four (and possibly other similar) RPGs. By comparing the original vs. the new RPGs derived from the RPG-PLA, we demonstrated that reuse allowed us to achieve improved performance, both speed and memory utilization, as compared to each game developed individually. At the same time, our solution facilitated rapid development of new games, for new mobile devices, as well as ease of evolving with new features the RPG-PLA and custom games already in use.},

This avatar is the user{\textquoteright}s alter ego in the game. In this paper, we present a telepresence interface for the first person game Quake III Arena, which gives the user the impression of presence in the game and thus leads to identification with his avatar. This is achieved by tracking the user{\textquoteright}s motion and using this motion data as control input for the avatar. As the user is wearing a head-mounted display and he perceives his actions affecting the virtual environment, he fully immerses into the target environment. Without further processing of the user{\textquoteright}s motion data, the virtual environment would be limited to the size of the user{\textquoteright}s real environment, which is not desirable. The use of Motion Compression, however, allows exploring an arbitrarily large virtual environment while the user is actually moving in an environment of limited size.},

However, plugging cognitive models in is non-trivial, since games are currently not designed with AI researchers in mind. In this paper we introduce an intermediate architecture that fits between these game and the AI, and assess its feasibility by implementing it within the game Unreal Tournament 2004. Making such an architecture publicly available may potentially lead to improved quality of game AI.},

Regarding the second purpose, the issue is not to produce occasionally a weak move (i.e., a give-away move) so that the human player can win, but rather to produce not-so-strong moves under the proviso that, on a balance of probabilities, they should go unnoticed. This paper focuses on using adaptive game AI to implement a tutoring system for commercial games.(1) We depart from the novel learning technique {\textquoteright}dynamic scripting{\textquoteright} and add three straightforward enhancements to achieve an {\textquoteright}even game{\textquoteright}, viz. high-fitness penalising, weight clipping, and top culling. Experimental results indicate that top culling is particularly successful in creating an even game. Hence, our conclusion is that dynamic scripting with top culling can implement a successful tutoring system for commercial games.},

Findings - This article suggests that both the videogame industry and the compulsory educational system are engaged in commensurate crises. The videogame industry is creatively rich but risk-averse, motivated primarily by wealth and reinforced by its own success. The education establishment is bureaucratic and self-effacing, endorsing the production of complacency over challenge. With videogames and education caught in similar ruts, to support change in one means endorsing a revolution in the other. Originality/value - Compares the videogame industry with the educational establishment and suggests ways in which the videogame industry can assist education.},

	abstract = {The appeal of computer games may be enhanced by visionbased user inputs. The high speed and low cost requirements for nearterm, mass-market game applications make system design challenging. Tn this paper we propose a vision based 3D racing car game controlling method, which analyzes two fists positions of the player in video stream from the camera to get the direction commands of the racing car. This paper especially focuses on the robust and real-time Bayesian network (BN) based multi-cue fusion fist tracking method. Firstly, a new strategy, which employs the latest work in face recognition, is used to create accurate color model of the fist automatically. Secondly, color cue and motion cue are used to generate the possible position of the fist. Then, the posterior probability of each possible position is evaluated by BN, which fuses color cue and appearance cue. Finally, the fist position is approximated by the hypothesis that maximizes a posterior. Based on the proposed control system, a racing car game, "Simulation Drive", has been developed by our group. Through the game an entirely new experience can be obtained by the player.},

This paper describes a Navy-funded research project that uses gaming technology for not only training, but also as an operational decision aid for the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS). The research is aimed at adapting game engine technology to predict and simulate the motion of ground target vehicles (e.g. SCUD Launchers) through their local terrain over a given period of time, then use the associated rendering capabilities to provide realistic 3D views. The paper presents an overview of the TTWCS mission and how it will benefit from specific advances in gaming technology, especially in the areas of artificial intelligence, path finding, and physics. It discusses the current state of the project using existing commercial gaming technology and the future plans for adapting and expanding the open source game engine technology of the Delta3D project underway at the MOVES Institute at the Naval Postgraduate School.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in computer graphics, particularly in real-time rendering, have caused major improvements in 3D graphics and rendering techniques used in interactive entertainment. In this paper, we focus on the scene lighting process, which we define as the process of configuring the number of lights used in a scene, their properties (e.g. range and attenuation), positions, angles, and colors. Lighting design is well known among designers, directors, and visual artists for its vital role in influencing viewers{\textquoteright} perception by evoking moods, directing their gaze to important areas (i.e. providing visual focus), and conveying visual tension. It is, however, difficult to set positions, angles, or colors for lights within interactive scenes to accommodate these design goals, because an interactive scene{\textquoteright}s spatial and dramatic configuration, including mood, dramatic intensity, and the relative importance of different characters, change unpredictably in real-time. There are several techniques developed by the game industry that establish spectacular real-time lighting effects within 3-D interactive environments. These techniques are often time and labor intensive. In addition, they are not easily used to dynamically mold the visual design to convey communicative, dramatic, and aesthetic functions as addressed in creative disciplines, such as art, film, and theatre. In this paper, we present a new real-time lighting design model based on cinematic and theatric lighting design theory. The proposed model is designed to automatically, and in real-time, adjust lighting in an interactive scene accommodating the dramatic, aesthetic, and communicative functions described by traditional lighting design theories while accommodating artistic constraints concerning style, visual continuity, and aesthetic function.},

This paper presents findings from our ongoing survey of commercial game technologies for military relevance. In this paper we focus on those technologies related to behavior modeling and the authoring of behavior models and attempt to lay a foundation for behavior modelers to understand the gaming industry {\textendash} its methods, goals and accomplishments. We extrapolate where the industry is going and what future synergies it is likely to contribute. We focus on behavior generation and other accomplishments that are relevant for training applications and especially for non-programmer authorship of content for training applications. We will argue that the gaming industry{\textquoteright}s modeling capabilities are currently of little theoretical interest but that pragmatically, the current accomplishments of the gaming industry can have a substantial positive impact on training and modeling and that this impact will increase over the next few years.

The findings from videogame research within a general population are 
compared with those among mental health and forensic clients. Within the 
general population, videogames may provide opportunities for social 
interaction and the expression of creativity and humour as well as offering a 
graded approach to building computer skills. Within a forensic population, 
videogames have been found to be a normalising, age-appropriate and 
culturally appropriate activity, useful in engaging clients and improving 
self-concept and locus of control. 
The findings suggest that videogame play offers access to a safe virtual 
environment that encourages exploration and mastery and that it may be a 
useful therapeutic tool in secure settings where such opportunities are often 
limited. The use and potential contraindications of videogames within a 
forensic setting, the content of certain games and their possible influence on

But we do know that from the ongoing experiment of the online game world will come ideas and insights that will enable us to design and measure a DARWARS community. DARWARS is a DARPA-funded effort to revolutionize training and increase military readiness by providing online practice combining a robust technical infrastructure with elements from computer-aided instruction, intelligent tutoring systems, and multiplayer games. The vision of DARWARS is to <strong>bring together trainees, trainers, subject matter experts across military echelons, geographic locations, as well as use-cases (training events, single participant after-hours, etc.) into an active community with different reinforcing interests: pedagogy, training, entertainment, and content creation</strong>. A challenge of DARWARS is to develop mutually supporting communities. To forward our understanding of community, <strong>this paper will examine aspects of the online game world with which we expect our DARWARS community to share important properties.</strong> This paper will cite a number of illustrating lessons, related to community. In particular we will examine the content-creation role of community.

Many research projects focused on adapting the narrative content to the interaction, yet little attention was given to adapting the visual presentation. In this paper, I present a new approach to interactive narrative {\textendash} an approach based on filmmaking theory. I propose an interactive narrative architecture, that in addition to dynamically selecting narrative events that suit the continuously changing situation, it automatically, and in real-time, reconfigures the visual design integrating camera movements, lighting modulation, and character movements. The architecture utilizes rules extracted from filmmaking, cinematography, and visual arts theories.

But in the past ten years, games have ballooned in complexity.

We use inverse kinematics based motion adaptation to make pre-existing pieces of motion apply to new targets. The expressiveness of the character is enhanced by adding autonomous behaviour, in this case eye gaze behaviour. This behaviour is generated autonomously but is still influenced by the actions that the user is requesting the character to perform. The actions themselves are simple for a designer with no programming experience to design and for an end user to customise. They are also very simple to invoke.},

On the other hand it shows that the relationship between TV viewing and cultivation measures is not an artifact of systematic over reporting. The study concludes that cultivation measures typical of the "television world" are not related to playing video games. To study video game cultivation measures must be sought which reflect the mainstream of (particular genres of) video games. The role of selectivity needs to be studied more closely. As gainers play an active role in the violence of the games the possibility that self-protecting strategies are employed in processing video game contents must be taken into consideration.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Violent media exposure has been associated with aggressive behavior, and it has been suggested that child health professionals counsel families on limiting exposure. Effective violence prevention counseling requires an understanding of norms regarding parental attitudes, practices, and influencing factors. Both theories of reasoned action and planned behavior emphasize that subjective norms and attitudes affect people{\textquoteright}s perceptions and intended behavior. Few data exist on violent television viewing and monitoring from a cross-section of families. By understanding the spectrum of parental attitudes, community-sensitive interventions for violence prevention can be developed. The objective of this study was to assess attitudes about and monitoring of violent television viewing from the perspective of parents.

METHODS: An anonymous self-report assisted survey was administered to a convenience sample of parents/guardians who visited child health providers at 3 sites: an urban children{\textquoteright}s hospital clinic, an urban managed care clinic, and a suburban private practice. The parent questionnaire included questions on child-rearing attitudes and practices and sociodemographic information. RESULTS: A total of 1004 adults who accompanied children for health visits were recruited for the study; 922 surveys were completed (participation rate: 92\%). A total of 830 (90\%) respondents were parents and had complete child data. Of the 830 respondents, 677 had questions on television viewing included in the survey and were the focus of this analysis. Seventy-five percent of families reported that their youngest child watched television. Of these, 53\% reported always limiting violent television viewing, although 73\% believed that their children viewed television violence at least 1 time a week. Among television viewers, 81\% reported usually or always limiting viewing of sexual content on television and 45\% reported usually or always watching television with their youngest child. Among children who watched television, parents reported that they spent an average of 2.6 hours per day watching television. Limitation of television violence was associated with female parents and younger children. 

CONCLUSIONS: There was variability in attitudes and practices regarding television violence viewing and monitoring among parents. Attitudes and practices varied on the basis of the age of the child and the gender of the parent.},

The constritctionist design methodology (CDM)-so called because it advocates modular building blocks and incorporation of prior work-addresses factors that we see as key to future advances in At, including support for interdisciplinary collaboration, coordination of teams, and large-scale systems integration. We test the methodology by building an interactive multifunctional system with a real-time perception-action loop. The system, whose construction relied entirely on the methodology, consists of an embodied virtual agent that can perceive both real and virtual objects in an augmented-reality room and interact with a user through coordinated gestures and speech. Wireless tracking technologies give the agent awareness of the environment and the user{\textquoteright}s speech and communicative acts. User and agent can communicate about things in the environment, their placement, and their function, as well as about more abstract topics, such as current news, through situated multimodal dialogue. The results demonstrate the CDM{\textquoteright}s strength in simplifying the modeling of complex, Multifunctional systems that require architectural experimentation and exploration of unclear subsystem boundaries, undefined variables, and tangled data flow and control hierarchies.},

The greater character identification may be especially worrisome, as past research has shown that justified media violence disinhibits actual aggression on the part of the audience.},

optimization is currently the most effective technique for improving
rendering performance in complex 3D environments. The primary reason
for this is that during each frame the pixel processing subsystem needs
to determine the visibility of each pixel individually. Currently,
rendering performance in larger scenes is input sensitive, and most of
the processing time is wasted on rendering geometry not visible in the
final image. Here we concentrate on real-time visualization using
mainstream graphics hardware that has a z-buffer as a de facto standard
for hidden surface removal. In an ideal system only the complexity of
the geometry actually visible on the screen would significantly impact
rendering time - 3D application performance should be output sensitive.

Methods. The participants were 122 preschool children enrolled in a rural county Head Start program in the United States during 2001-2002. The following tests were administered to the children: the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test; the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts, Third Edition Preschool; the Test of Gross Motor Development, Second Edition; and a short form of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-Revised. Information pertaining to family characteristics and children{\textquoteright}s early computer experience was collected from parents. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association between early computer experience and cognitive and motor development. Results. Of the participating children, 53\% had a computer at home. Among families who had a computer, 83\% had children{\textquoteright}s software on the computer. According to parents{\textquoteright} reports, 29\% of these children played on the home computer on a daily basis, and an additional 44\% of the children played on the computer at least weekly. Of those families who did not have a home computer, 49\% reported that their children had access to a computer somewhere outside home. Among these children, 10\% had daily access to the computer and 33\% had weekly access. The presence of a computer in the home was significantly associated with the family{\textquoteright}s income and the educational attainment of the parents. There was no gender difference in computer accessibility and frequency use among the participating children. Children who had access to a computer performed better on measures of school readiness and cognitive development, controlling for children{\textquoteright}s developmental stage and family socioeconomic status. The data in the current study did not suggest a relationship between computer experience and visual motor or gross motor skills among the participating children. Conclusion. The findings in the present study suggest that early computer exposure before or during the preschool years is associated with development of preschool concepts and cognition among young children. However, frequency of use did not reveal such a relationship; neither did the ownership of other child electronic or video games in the household.},

However, type-1 diabetic children have not appreciated traditional learning methods since they rarely contain the elements of fun and interactivity. In this study, we developed, implemented and evaluated a preliminary version of edutainment tools for initial education for type-1 diabetic children. METHODS: Three games running on either personal computer (PC) and GameBoy Advance were developed. All games were designed to educate patients about relationships among food (carbohydrate), plasma glucose level, exercise, and insulin dose. A total of 58 testers evaluated degree of entertainment, usability and clinical usefulness of the games. RESULTS: Generally, testers felt all games were intuitive and fun and the usability of games was highly scored. More than 90\% of testers showed an interest in the edutainment approach, and approximately 60\% agreed that these games could provide attractive educational environment compared to traditional education, especially for children. CONCLUSIONS: Our edutainment systems were accepted as attractive learning tools for type-1 diabetic children who need initial education.

In addition, path analyses were conducted to test mediational pathways from video game habits to outcomes. Six hundred and seven 8th- and 9th-grade students from four schools participated. Adolescents who expose themselves to greater amounts of video game violence were more hostile, reported getting into arguments with teachers more frequently, were more likely to be involved in physical fights, and performed more poorly in school. Mediational pathways were found such that hostility mediated the relationship between violent video game exposure and outcomes.

Although television watching has been repeatedly associated with obesity, it is unclear whether other sedentary activities, such as use of electronic games, are independently associated with obesity in children. The hypothesis was that various types of sedentary activities are associated with obesity in children living in Switzerland. Research Methods and Procedures: This was a cross-sectional study of children (grades one to three) from four communities in the Greater Zurich Area (Switzerland). Obesity was defined as a combination of overweight (BMI) and overfat (skinfold thicknesses). Environmental factors were assessed by questionnaire. The children{\textquoteright}s physical activity was estimated by their teacher (scale 0 to 10). Results: Of 922 eligible subjects, 872 (94.6\%) took part in the study. Use of electronic games [odds ratio (OR) = 2.03 per hour per day, 95\% confidence interval (Cl): 1.57 to 2.61, p < 0.001], television (OR = 2.83 per hour per day, 95\% CI: 2.08 to 3.86, p < 0.001), physical activity (OR = 0.80 per unit, 95\% CI: 0.72 to 0.88, p < 0.001), maternal work (OR = 1.93, 95\% Cl: 1.13 to 3.29, p = 0.02), and paternal smoking (OR = 1.78, 95\% CI: 1.07 to 2.96, p = 0.03) were independently associated with obesity. Further adjustment for socioeconomic status, when available, did not change these results. Discussion: In this sample of children living in Switzerland, the use of electronic games was significantly associated with obesity, independently of confounding factors. The association of obesity with television use and lack of physical activity confirms results from other populations and points to potential strategies for obesity prevention.},

This research emphasized the development of methods to automate the production of behavioral robot controllers. We seek methods that do not require a human designer to define specific intermediate behaviors for a complex robot task. The work made use of a real mobile robot colony (EVolutionary roBOTs) and a closely coupled computer-based simulated training environment. The acquisition of behavior in an evolutionary robotics system was demonstrated using a robotic version of the game Capture the Flag. In this game, played by two teams of competing robots, each team tries to defend its own goal while trying to {\textquoteright}attack{\textquoteright} another goal defended by the other team. Robot neural controllers relied entirely on processed video data for sensing of their environment. Robot controllers were evolved in a simulated environment using evolutionary training algorithms. In the evolutionary process, each generation consisted of a competitive tournament of games played between the controllers in an evolving population. Robot controllers were selected based on whether they won or lost games in the course of a tournament. Following a tournament, the neural controllers were ranked competitively according to how many games they won and the population was propagated using a mutation and replacement strategy. After several hundred generations, the best performing controllers were transferred to teams of real mobile robots, where they exhibited behaviors similar to those seen in simulation including basic navigation, the ability to distinguish between different types of objects, and goal tending behaviors.},

A principal dynamic of these processes concerns the opposition between {\textquoteright}ludological{\textquoteright} and narratological theorisations of the computer game. This opposition is examined for both its limitations and its productive potential by means of consideration of the thing game and its relation to john carpenter{\textquoteright}s cinematic iteration of the original short story from which it is adapted.

To explore gender identity and aggressive personality in the context of computers, an online survey was conducted on women who played computer games and women who used the computer but did not play computer games. Women who played computer games perceived their online environments as less friendly but experienced less sexual harassment online, were more aggressive themselves, and did not differ in gender identity, degree of sex role stereotyping, or acceptance of sexual violence when compared to women who used the computer but did not play video games. Finally, computer gaming was associated with decreased participation in computer-related employment; however, women with high masculine gender identities were more likely to use computers at work.},

In response to this, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) drafted a set of technology standards for teachers (ISTE, 2002) that specifically states that teachers should empower all students and support diversity. This content analysis of educational software for preschoolers was designed to look at gender representations and stereotyping. The results demonstrated significantly more male characters than female characters in preschool educational software, which makes it difficult for teachers to address gender diversity and suggests that girls are not as valued as boys are. Male characters were also more likely than female characters to exhibit several masculine-stereotypical traits. In addition, female characters more than male characters exhibited counterstereotypical behaviors, yet were more gender stereotyped in appearance.},

	abstract = {When pundits-and some researchers-proclaim electronic games,either altogether good or altogether bad for society, they often miss theoretical subtleties that if considered would allow us to see both the boon and the burden of the emerging technology and point to important future possibilities. Most important, these critics often jail to recognize that variability exists at different levels of analysis and in the interactions: between players, between games, between contexts, and so forth. The simultaneous existence of both positive and negative consequences of electronic games can be elaborated and reconciled in part through a multilevel perspective on electronic game effects whereby important variables exist at the levels of the individual, game content, and societal time or space. This article illustrates this idea by reviewing some recent findings in this arena and pointing to common threads that relate to the likely multilevel structure of human interaction with electronic games.},

Part of this concern stems from the fact that a considerable amount of violence is regularly portrayed on television. In addition, those youngsters who watch an excessive amount of television have little time for developing other interests and hobbies. Using simple electronic principles and behavior modification, a research team at DePaul University has developed several procedures to wean children off television. This research involved dispensing tokens to children after they had engaged in a period of prosocial behavior. Children{\textquoteright}s television viewing decreased after being provided these interventions, and follow-up data suggested that changes were maintained over time. The interventions and devices reviewed in this article are practical ways of empowering parents to have more influence on their children{\textquoteright}s television viewing.},

Methods: A national representative sample of 4222 schoolchildren (7th- and 8th-graders; mean age 13.9 years) answered questions on the frequency of television-viewing, electronic game-playing, feeling unsafe at school, bullying others, hitting others, and fighting with others, as part of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) international collaborative study protocol. The Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to high-risk groups of adolescents. Results: For the total sample, all bivariate relationships between television-viewing/electronic game-playing and each violence-related variable are significant. In the multivariate comparison, physical violence among boys ceases to be significant. For girls, only television-viewing is linked to indirect violence. Against the hypothesis, females{\textquoteright} electronic game-playing only had a bearing on hitting others. Conclusions: Experimental designs are needed that take into account gender, different forms of media, and violence to answer the question of whether excessive media use leads to violent behavior. With the exception of excessive electronic game-playing among girls, this study found that electronic media are not thought to lead directly to real-life violence but to hostility and indirect violence. },

The main goal of the programme is to sharpen their problem and health consciousness concerning addiction and pleasure seeking. The programme was evaluated by a longitudinal study. At three given times, the 12- to 15-year-old pupils of the experimental classes were interviewed by standardized self-completion questionnaires (n = 2,267). The control classes were submitted to two surveys (n = 586). The study was carried out in the areas of Innsbruck (Austria), Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) and South Tyrol (Italy). Not all pupils were able to keep their intentions submitted in their contract, but 4 of 5 pupils had at least one positive experience with the renunciation (82\%). There were {\textquoteleft}overall effects{\textquoteright}: The actual renunciation of the pupils was much higher than stated in their agreement. The experimental group showed significant reduction effects for pupils, who had successfully reduced or stopped use of a substance or medium. In a further step, it should be explored whether the programme is suitable also for older groups, i.e. for pupils older than 15 years. Moreover, the long-term effects of the programmes should be tested.},

By contrast, the process of localizing productivity applications follows a relatively well-defined set of guidelines, with which many technical communicators are familiar. The localization processes for digital games, however, can follow one of three levels of complexity, none of which are formally articulated. In this article, we focus on the most challenging and most potentially effective form of digital game localization, known as blending. Blending involves the alteration of the central storyline of a game to make the game more successful in other countries. We believe that technical and professional communicators should learn more about blending, digital game localization, and their place within the burgeoning game industry.

Typical examples of these applications are networked computer games and distributed virtual environments. We give a formal definition of the terms consistency and correctness for this application class. Based on these definitions, it is shown that an important tradeoff relationship exists between the responsiveness of the application and the appearance of short-term inconsistencies. We propose to exploit the knowledge of this tradeoff by voluntarily decreasing the responsiveness of the application in order to eliminate short-term inconsistencies. This concept is called local-lag. Furthermore, a timewarp scheme is presented that complements local-lag by guaranteeing consistency and correctness for replicated continuous applications. The computational complexity of the timewarp algorithm is determined in theory and practice by examining a simple networked computer game. The timewarp scheme is then compared to the well-known dead-reckoning approach. It is shown that the choice between both schemes is application-dependent.},

	abstract = {This paper offers a preliminary analysis of a web-based questionnaire on mobile culture and entertainment. Respondents were found to value the advice of those in their informal social and knowledge networks when choosing mobile operators and ME products and services. Respondents demonstrated their reluctance to switch operators, in spite of indications of dissatisfaction with their current providers. Despite high usage levels of fixed-line Internet for entertainment purposes respondents were less than enthusiastic about mobile entertainment. Gaming, taking and sending pictures, watching video clips and listening to music on mobiles were all met with a lack of enthusiasm, with the majority of our sample emphasising the importance of the more {\textquoteright}traditional{\textquoteright} communicative functions of mobiles. Evidence of conflicting views on content pricing and handset usability demonstrates the embryonic nature of the ME market. Consumer expectations are still in the process of being formed. In terms of consumer concerns, our results suggest that health worries and the protection of minors from {\textquoteright}inappropriate material{\textquoteright} were minimal amongst this particular set of respondents. {\textquoteright}Junk text{\textquoteright} was highlighted as the major source of concern. Respondents appeared reluctant to buy into the convergence trope of {\textquoteright}one device for all{\textquoteright} although modernist notions of continuous technological progress were evident in user expectations. Given the {\textquoteright}early adopter{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteright}highlevel user{\textquoteright} status of the majority of our respondents, their views on the future direction of mobile entertainment services are highly relevant here. Further work is needed to reach a greater understanding of the relationship between user and technology, between consumer and mobile entertainment product, as this embryonic market gradually matures.},

In Crash Bandicoot participants control the movements of a small-animated figure through a hazardous jungle environment. Operationally defined measures of motor control were designated by (1) the stage of the game completed (ie, the number of obstacles successfully passed) before losing the figure{\textquoteright}s {\textquoteright}life{\textquoteright}, (2) the level of complexity that the stage represented and (3) the time taken to get to that point during the video game play. These measures were assessed under contrasting conditions of low or high working memory and distracter loads. Four tasks were administered (totalling 12 trials), incorporating both with and without distracter conditions. For those trials with the distracter, a segment of the television show The Simpsons was simultaneously played on a television screen adjacent to the computer game monitor. A 5-way MANOVA revealed that ADHD boys took less time to complete their trials under the direct condition (ie, no working memory load) on Crash Bandicoot, compared to their matched non-ADHD peers. When the task required additional working memory, however, the ADHD boys took significantly longer. Cumulative frequency plots of game performance revealed that in terms of the number of obstacles completed, the control participants successfully navigated more obstacles on the low working memory load task than the ADHD participants, but that the performance of the two groups was less distinguishable on the high working memory load task. The findings have implications for assessment and management of children with ADHD.},

Based on the assumption that Net-generation has unique characteristics, this study examined (1) how Net-geners addicted to the Internet differ from the non-addicted and (2) how these attributes, together with the seductive properties of the Internet, are related to Internet addiction. Data were gathered from a probability sample of 699 Net-geners between the ages of 16 and 24. Results show that Net-geners addicted to the Internet tend to be young female students. Being emotionally open on the Net and a heavy user of ICQ were most influential in predicting Net-geners{\textquoteright} problematic use of the Internet. Addicted Net-geners are also strongly linked to the pleasure of being able to control the simulated world in online games. The finding reinforces previous research that "dependents" of the Internet spend most of their time in the synchronous communication environment engaging in interactive online games, chat rooms, and ICQ for pleasure-seeking or escape, while "non-dependents" use information-gathering functions available on the Internet. Furthermore, Internet addicts tend to watch television significantly less, indicating a displacement effect on traditional media use for the Net-generation.},

Subjects took less time to process the negative outcome. The positive outcome resulted in more subject-generated aggression than the negative outcome. There were few sex differences but men wrote more aggressive endings than women for the stories containing physical aggression. Trait aggressiveness was correlated with producing more aggressive content in the continuing sentence for both outcomes. Feeling peaceful was correlated with producing prosocial material to neutral stories. Subjects therefore expect a negative outcome to aggressive behaviour. Reading stories which present a positive outcome to aggression increases the accessibility of aggressive cognitions. Subjects high in trait aggressiveness are not inhibited by a negative outcome. },

A greater percentage of adolescents had a high level of sedentary behavior when both parents versus no parents watched television >2h/day (OR 1.95 (1.5-2.6)). Parent-child physical activity relationships were not modified by the family SES or the children{\textquoteright}s or parents{\textquoteright} weight status. Conclusion: Parental involvement in sport is an important correlate of a young adolescent{\textquoteright}s participation in structured PA outside school, whatever the family SES or corpulence of the family members.},

	abstract = {We propose a real-time 3D audio rendering pipeline for complex virtual scenes containing hundreds of moving sound sources. The approach, based on auditory culling and spatial level-of-detail, can handle more than ten times the number of sources commonly available on consumer 3D audio hardware, with minimal decrease in audio quality. The method performs well for both indoor and outdoor environments. It leverages the limited capabilities of audio hardware for many applications, including interactive architectural acoustics simulations and automatic 3D voice management for video games. Our approach dynamically eliminates inaudible sources and groups the remaining audible sources into a budget number of clusters. Each cluster is represented by one impostor sound source, positioned using perceptual criteria. Spatial audio processing is then performed only on the impostor sound sources rather than on every original source thus greatly reducing the computational cost. A pilot validation study shows that degradation in audio quality, as well as localization impairment, are limited and do not seem to vary significantly with the cluster budget. We conclude that our real-time perceptual audio rendering pipeline can generate spatialized audio for complex auditory environments without introducing disturbing changes in the resulting perceived soundfield.},

Recent rapid increases in juvenile obesity have received a great deal of attention in the scientific and popular press and have been attributed partly to television viewing, computer games and other sedentary behaviours. These are thought to compete with physical activity. There is a {\textquoteright}moral panic{\textquoteright} concerning the {\textquoteright}couch kids{\textquoteright} culture in modern western society. Project STIL (Sedentary Teenagers and Inactive Lifestyles) at Loughborough University is investigating {\textquoteright}what young people do{\textquoteright} and focuses on active and inactive pursuits chosen in their Leisure time. The following issues are addressed in this paper with specific reference to young people: how do we define {\textquoteright}sedentary behaviour{\textquoteright} and do key sedentary behaviours displace physical activity? Are key sedentary behaviours obesogenic? What are the secular trends for children and youth for TV viewing? Our results for young people suggest that: 1. TV viewing and video-game playing are Largely uncorrelated with physical activity, suggesting that there is time for both. 2. meta-analytic findings show that body fatness is not related in any clinically meaningful way with key sedentary behaviours 3. although more children and youth have greater access to TVs than in previous generations, the amount of TV watched per head has not changed for 40 years. Preliminary findings from Project STIL suggest that inactivity is more complex than we sometimes think. Indeed, measures of {\textquoteright}couch potato-ism{\textquoteright}, such as TV viewing, may be inappropriate markers of inactivity.},

(b) Elementary visual stimuli that enable inferences to be drawn concerning the physiological trigger mechanisms. The topographic distribution of epileptiform EEG activity in response to such stimuli has complemented this approach, leading to the inference that the trigger is cortical and requires sychronised mass action of neurons. (c) Stimuli that avoid paroxysmal EEG activity and permit an investigation of the subepileptic response to visual stimuli, using the evoked potential. This has revealed abnormalities in the cortical mechanisms that control the response to strong visual stimulation.},

Scientific culture is not popular because the essential nature of science - the models and practices that make it up - cannot be communicated via conventional media in a manner that is interesting to the average person. These models and practices might be communicated in an interesting manner using the new medium of the digital game, yet very few digital games based upon scientific simulations have been created and thus the potential of such games to facilitate scientific knowledge construction cannot be studied directly. Scientific simulations have, however, been much used by scientists to facilitate their own knowledge construction, and equally, both simulations and games have been used by science educators to facilitate knowledge construction on the part of their students. The large academic literatures relating to these simulations and games collectively demonstrate that their ability to re-create reality, model complex systems, be visual and interactive, engage the user in the practise of science, and to engage the user in construction and collaboration, makes them powerful tools for facilitating scientific knowledge construction. Moreover, the large non-academic literature discussing the nature of digital games (which are themselves both simulations and games) demonstrates that their ability to perform the above tasks (i.e. to re-create reality, model complex systems, and so forth) is what makes them enjoyable to play. Because the features of scientific and educational simulations and games that facilitate knowledge construction are the very same features that make digital games enjoyable to play, the player of a scientific-simulation-based digital game would be simultaneously gaining enjoyment and acquiring scientific knowledge. If science were widely communicated using digital games, therefore, then it would be possible for there to be a popular scientific culture.

In general, streaming applications include IP telephony, multimedia broadcasts and various interactive applications such as multi-party conferences, collaborations and multiplayer games. Successfully realizing such applications in a highly mobile environment, however, presents many research challenges. In order to investigate such challenges and demonstrate viable solutions, we have developed an experimental indoor and outdoor testbed laboratory. By implementing standard IETF protocols into this testbed, we have demonstrated the basic functionalities required of the mobile wireless Internet to successfully support mobile multimedia access. These requirements include signaling, registration, dynamic configuration, mobility binding, location management, Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA), and quality of service over a variety of radio access network (RAN) technologies (e.g. 802.11b, CDMA/GPRS). In this paper, we describe this testbed and discuss important design issues and tradeoffs. We detail the incorporation and inter-relation of a wide catalog of IETF protocols-such as SIP, SAP, SDP, RTP/RTCP/RTSP, MGCP, variants of Mobile-IP, DRCP, HMMP, PANA, and DSNP-to achieve our goals. We believe that the results and experiences obtained from this experimental testbed will advance the understanding of the pertinent deployment issues for a Mobile Wireless Internet. },

Experimental results show that the proposed method is, on average, 93.36\% reliable in spotting gestures from continuous gestures, confirming its potential for a gesture-based interface for computer games.},

Some of these applications rely on a scenario that is revealed to the user as he/she interacts with synthetic objects and characters that inhabit virtual worlds. The development and authoring of interactive dynamic scenarios is often hard and difficult to accomplish using current techniques. Many interactive scenario developers use decision trees, which yield very limiting and unfulfilling training experiences, because they do not stimulate learning or thinking beyond the scripted paths. Some researchers proposed plan-based interactive narrative architectures, which, although superior to decision trees, do not scale and do not address user{\textquoteright}s goals and intentions, yielding inflexible scenarios that do not adapt suitably to players{\textquoteright} goals or behaviors. In this paper, we propose a dynamic scenario architecture that aims at enhancing scalability and reuse by using a multi-agent layered problem solving technique.

The main goals were to have: a modular behavior system able to support a large variety of behaviors, memory-efficient and robust saved games, many distinct NPC types with different styles of movement and combat, fast and robust pathfinding, robust movement and collision, and modular steering behaviors. The goals were largely met, though some issues became apparent in the course of development, primarily difficulties for designers with setting up movement graphs and NPC logic.

	abstract = {Computer gaming is a key component of the rapidly growing entertainment industry. While building computer games has typically been a commercial endeavor, we believe that designing and constructing a computer game is also a useful activity for educating students about geometric modeling and computer graphics. In particular, students are exposed to the practical issues surrounding topics such as geometric modeling, rendering. collision detection, character animation and graphical design. Moreover, building an advanced game provides students exposure to the real-world side of software engineering that they are typically shielded from in the standard computer class. In this paper, we describe our experiences with teaching a computer science class that focuses on designing and building the best game possible in the course of a semester. The paper breaks down a typical game into various components that are suited for individual student projects and discusses the use of modem graphical design tools such as Maya in building art for the game. We conclude with a rough timeline for developing a game during the course of a semester and review some of the lessons learned during the three years we have taught the class.},

	abstract = {Objective To conduct a population-based survey of television and other media usage in young children to determine (1) total media usage; (2) the proportion of children who have televisions in their bedrooms and who eat breakfast or dinner in front of the television; and (3) predictors of parental concern about the amount of television their child watches. Study design Telephone survey administered to 1454 parents of children <11 years old derived from a diverse clinic population. Results The mean age of the index child was 5.05 years. Mean daily reported child media use was as follows: television (1.45 hours; SD, 1.5); videos (1.1 hours; SD, 1.30); and computer games (0.54 hours; SD, 0.96). Thirty percent of parents reported that their child ate breakfast or dinner in front of the television in the past week, and 22\% were concerned about the amount of television that their child watched. In multivariate linear regression, eating breakfast or dinner in front of the television in the past week was associated with increased hours of television viewing (0.38 hours [0.21, 0.54]) and video (0.19 hours [0.04, 0.34]). Having a television in a child{\textquoteright}s bedroom was associated with increased hours of television (0.25 hours [0.07, 0.43]), video viewing (0.31 hours [0.16, 0.47]), and computer games (0.21 hours [0.10, 0.32]). In general, higher parental education was associated with decreased hours of television and video but not computer games. Older children were 2 to 3 times more likely than younger children to have a television in their bedroom and to have eaten a meal in front of it in the past week. More educated parents were less likely to report that their child had a television in their bedroom and more likely to be concerned about the amount of television their child viewed. Conclusions Combined video and computer game usage exceeded television usage. Both children of low- and high-income parents are at risk for certain behaviors associated with television usage. Parents whose children watched more television were more likely to be concerned about the amount of television their child viewed.},

Methods: A random sample of students from 15 schools in Flanders, Belgium, yielded 2546 children who completed a questionnaire with questions about media presence in bedrooms; volume of television viewing, computer game playing, and Internet use; time to bed and time up on average weekdays and average weekend days; and questions regarding the level of tiredness in the morning, at school, after a day at school, and after the weekend. Results: Children with a television set in their rooms went to bed significantly later on weekdays and weekend days and got up significantly later on weekend days. Overall, they spent less time in bed on weekdays. Children with a gaming computer in their rooms went to bed significantly later on weekdays. On weekdays, they spent significantly less time in bed. Children who watched more television went to bed later on weekdays and weekend days and got up later on weekend days. They spent less time in bed on weekdays. They reported higher overall levels of being tired. Children who spent more time playing computer games went to bed later on weekdays and weekend days and got up later on weekend days. On weekdays, they actually got up significantly earlier. They spent less time in bed on weekdays and reported higher levels of tiredness. Children who spent more time using the Internet went to bed significantly later during the week and during the weekend. They got up later on weekend days. They spent less time in bed during the week and reported higher levels of tiredness. Going out was also significantly related to sleeping later and less. Conclusion: Concerns about media use should not be limited to television. Computer game playing and Internet use are related to sleep behavior as well. Leisure activities that are unstructured seem to be negatively related to good sleep patterns. Imposing more structure (eg, end times) might reduce impact.},

In doing so, it advances a set of formal analytical tools and a theoretical framework for the analysis of turn-based computer strategy games. The analytical tools extend the useful work of Steven Poole, who suggests a Peircian semiotic approach to the study of games as formal systems. The theoretical framework draws upon postmodern cultural theory to analyse and explain the representation of space and the organisation of knowledge in these games. The methodology and theoretical framework is supported by a textual analysis of Civilization II, a significant and influential turn-based computer strategy game. Finally, this paper suggests possibilities for future extensions of this work.},

Users over the age of 75 are at risk for medically related cognitive problems and confusion, and early detection allows for more effective clinical intervention. In this paper, we present algorithms for inferring a user{\textquoteright}s cognitive performance using monitoring data from computer games and psychomotor measurements associated with keyboard entry and mouse movement. The inferences are then used to classify significant performance changes, and additionally, to adapt computer interfaces with tailored hints and assistance when needed.

An updated meta-analysis reveals that exposure to violent video games is significantly linked to increases in aggressive behaviour, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, and cardiovascular arousal, and to decreases in helping behaviour. Experimental studies reveal this linkage to be causal. Correlational studies reveal a linkage to serious, real-world types of aggression. Methodologically weaker studies yielded smaller effect sizes than methodologically stronger studies, suggesting that previous meta-analytic studies of violent video games underestimate the true magnitude of observed deleterious effects on behaviour, cognition, and affect. },

	abstract = {Interactive virtual environments are becoming increasingly popular for their utility in education, virtual training, and entertainment. These applications often rely on a scenario that is revealed to the user as he/she interacts with synthetic objects and characters that inhabit virtual worlds. Current interactive narrative architectures used in the interactive entertainment industry often use decision trees, which are hard to author and modify. Some interactive entertainment productions are starting to use more generative techniques, such as plan-based or goal-based narrative. In this paper, I present an interactive narrative architecture that extends current research in interactive narrative by integrating a user modeling and user behavior analysis technique, which I argue facilities a more engaging and fulfilling experience. I have implemented the architecture within an interactive story called Mirage. The architecture resulted from an iterative design and development process involving a team that included film and theatre professionals. During this design and development process, I have experimented and evaluated different narrative techniques, which resulted in the proposed architecture.

We hypothesized that giving such individual particles a limited distributed memory of past obstacles they encountered could lead to significantly faster travel between goal destinations. Systematic computational experiments using six terrains that had different arrangements of obstacles demonstrated that, at least in some domains, this conjecture is true. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrated that improved performance over time came not only from the avoidance of previously seen obstacles, but also (surprisingly) immediately after first encountering obstacles due to decreased delays in circumventing those obstacles. Simulations also showed that, of the four strategies we tested for removal of remembered obstacles when memory was full and a new obstacle was to be saved, none was better than random selection. These results may be useful in interpreting future experimental research on group movements in biological populations, and in improving existing methodologies for control of collective movements in computer graphics, robotic teams, particle swarm optimization, and computer games.},

Furthermore, at a psychological and behavioral level, slot machine gambling, video lottery terminal (VLT) gambling and video game playing share many of the same features. Despite the similarities between video game playing and gambling there have been very few studies that have specifically examined video game playing in relation to gambling behavior. This Study inquired about the nature of adolescent video game playing, gambling activities, and associated factors. A questionnaire was completed by 996 (549 females, 441 males, 6 unspecified) participants from grades 7-11, who ranged in age from 10- 17 years. Overall, the results of the study found a clear relationship between video game playing and gambling in adolescents, with problem gamblers being significantly more likely than non-problem gamblers or non-gamblers to spend excessive amounts of time playing video games. Problem gamblers were also significantly more likely than non-problem gamblers or non-gamblers to rate themselves as very good or excellent video game players. Furthermore, problem gamblers were more likely to report that they found video games, similar to electronic machine gambling, to promote dissociation and to be arousing and/or relaxing. },

One hundred fifty fourth and fifth graders completed measures of real-life violence exposure, media violence exposure, empathy, and attitudes towards violence. Regression analyses indicated that only exposure to video game violence was associated with (lower) empathy. Both video game and movie violence exposure were associated with stronger proviolence attitudes. The active nature of playing video games, intense engagement, and the tendency to be translated into fantasy play may explain negative impact, though causality was not investigated in the present design. The samples{\textquoteright} relatively low exposure to real-life violence may,have limited the identification of relationships. Although difficult to quantify, desensitization to violence should be further studied using related characteristics as in the present study.

Knowledge of these is useful in planning individual treatment and in designing regulations for screen content of television broadcasts or for other video displays. Some subjects will also be sensitive to cognitive or action-programming activation, especially when playing video games, and this can increase the chance of seizure triggering.

Residents trained in the Procedicus Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) laparoscopic simulator perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy safer and faster than a control group. Little has been reported regarding whether factors like gender, computer experience, and visuospatial tests can predict the performance with a medical simulator. Our aim was to investigate whether such factors influence the performance of simulated gastroscopy. Seventeen medical students were asked about computer gaming experiences. Before virtual endoscopy, they performed the visuospatial test PicCOr, which discriminates the ability of the tested person to create a three-dimensional image from a two-dimensional presentation. Each student performed one gastroscopy (level 1, case 1) in the GI Mentor II, Simbionix, and several variables related to performance were registered. Percentage of time spent with a clear view in the endoscope correlated well with the performance on the PicSOr test (r = 0.56, P < 0.001). Efficiency of screening also correlated with PicSOr (r = 0.23, P < 0.05). In students with computer gaming experience, the efficiency of screening increased (33.6\% +/- 3.1\% versus 22.6\% +/- 2.8\%, P < 0.05) and the duration of the examination decreased by 1.5 minutes (P < 0.05). A similar trend was seen in men compared with women. The visuospatial test PicSOr predicts the results with the endoscopic simulator GI Mentor II. Two-dimensional image experience, as in computer games, also seems to affect the outcome.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new scheme for designing MMORPG virtualworld that assigns dynamically synthesized tasks and scripts to avatars in a MMORPG. Different from most current MMORPGs, the new scheme tries to bridge the gap between a real social world with a virtual RPG social world by introducing social relationship, social structure, and avatar personality into the game play. Adaptation of social network analysis to MMORPG virtual world design is also discussed. The objective is to increase a game{\textquoteright}s long term appeal to players. Moreover, the paper also proposes a method to use data mining technique for intelligently selecting dynamically synthesized tasks so that the tasks will be most likely interesting to the players. The paper represents an endeavor to forge a common research ground for virtual world game design, social network analysis, artificial intelligence, and traditional data mining research.},

In this paper, we represent this problem as a constraint satisfaction problem which is often over-constrained. A range of complex requirements, such as frame coherence, occlusion and camera holes can be elegantly represented as constraints. We then apply both complete and incomplete search methods to find the optimal camera placement. An interactive computer games application was developed to experimentally evaluate these methods. Our experimental results and a discussion with related studies conclude that our approach is sophisticated both in modelling and solving the difficult task of 3D camera control.},

Attitudes to new technology were measured by asking from the subjects how interested in new technology they were. Two types of computer games were played in two different displays. The results show the dependence of experiential dimensions on subjects attitudes towards new technology. Attitudes to new technology modify the expectations and beliefs, hence the motivation of the user.

In prior work we designed a novel technique called "dynamic scripting" that is able to create successful adaptive opponents. However, experimental evaluations indicated that, occasionally, the time needed for dynamic scripting to generate effective opponents becomes unacceptably long. We investigated two different countermeasures against these long adaptation times (which we call "outliers"), namely a better balance between rewards and penalties, and a history-fallback mechanism. Experimental results indicate that a combination of these two countermeasures is able to reduce the number of outliers significantly. We therefore conclude that the performance of dynamic scripting is enhanced by these countermeasures.},

Young people with disabilities wish to use the popular computer games used by friends and family. The complexity and speed of standard computer games and the input requirements often prevent this.

	abstract = {Simulation has been used traditionally to solve other areas problems. Real time applications like videogames use typically a scheme of coupling of simulation phase and rendering phase and they uses a continuous simulation model. That way of operation is inefficient and may produce erroneous simulations. Using a discrete event simulation paradigm, those problems can be avoided. That paradigm can be achieved using a discrete event simulator as a videogame kernel. This paper proposes the integration of a discrete event simulator into real time applications to control the applications simulation. The use of a discrete methodology avoids disorderly events execution or the execution of cancelled events. This implies to use events in order to model the system dynamics, the objects interaction and the objects behavior. GDESK is a discrete event simulator prepared to be used as a videogame kernel. It is the adaptation of DESK (discrete event simulation kernel) to videogames kernel. GDESK allows the complete system to work using discrete events. The videogame is a set of objects interchanging events. The events are managed by the GDESK dispatcher. It executes the events ordered in time. The GDESK integration into a videogame produces the change of the videogame simulation paradigm. That produces a more accurate simulation and saves computing power due to the saves of unnecessary renderings.},

	abstract = {Message filtering is important for distributed multiagent systems, where a large number of dynamic agents participate in the system activity, but a typical agent is interested in only a very small dynamic subset of the other agents. The agent must be constantly informed on the status of this subset, and this is achieved by message passing between relevant agents. Message filtering is required to reduce the communications load on the system, which could be prohibitive if each agent must communicate with all others in order to obtain the information it needs. This paper deals with the case of a multiagent virtual environment, where each agent has a location in 2D space, and is interested in a small subset of the other agents, either those within a fixed range-as treated by previous authors, or the k other agents nearest to it-treated here for the first time. Furthermore, we treat the case of a fully distributed system, where no central server(s) are available to coordinate between the agents. The main challenge is then to design protocols that perform significant message filtering, yet enable each agent to maintain a consistent image of the other agents it is interested in. These protocols are useful in multiagent games, simulations, and other virtual environments in which the geometric relationships between agents are important. They could also be useful for mobile-commerce and cellphone-based gaming applications.},

Firstly we argue the following: When the absolute difference between reality and virtual environments decreases one would expect the latter to become increasingly believable for a spectator. Paradoxically often the opposite is true since the attention of the spectator gets drawn to the remaining differences to a greater extent. Secondly we ask ourselves why of all things computer games which are created for entertainment should be limited with real world constraints and are not used to experience features that are only possible in virtual environments.

The system was developed between imedia in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, and Questacon: The National Science and Technology Centre in Canberra, Australia. Communicating and implementing the project over such a distance was not problematic given the clearly defined roles of each team. The part of the project that required extensive negotiation and redesign was how the user interacts with each activity.

This primitive is used both in the data structure and in the rendering stage, which lowers storage cost and accelerates rendering time.

Game play, simulation and narrative have their own respective forms of engagement and immersion that have often been overlooked in the development of models for human-computer interaction. As game systems become more ubiquitous, technical platforms will evolve to support more game-like interaction in general. This will facilitate the development of many applications having ludic engagement and immersion modes that dissolve some of the distinctions between work and play, providing the potential for alleviating tedium in many computer-based work tasks.},

All of these applications also provide added value to telematics and military usage, including coordination, education, situation awareness, distributed simulation, battlefield communication, and multiplayer games. While content distribution over a wired network can be realized by instituting proxies and gateways at several parts of the access network, to provide mobility over heterogeneous wireless access we need to consider many operational issues such as handoff, join and leave latency, and desired QoS level for mobile clients. This article discusses some application layer techniques that help build a flexible mobile content distribution overlay type network supporting a multitiered payment and security scheme. The proposed streaming network, called MarconiNet, is based on standard.

Short-term tactile memory is the crucial factor in educational and vocational environments for deaf and blind people. We designed a vibro-tactile pen and software to create tactons and semantic sequences of vibro-tactile patterns on mobile devices (iPAQ pocket PC). We propose special games to facilitate learning and manipulation by tactons. The techniques are based on gesture recognition and spatial-temporal mapping for imaging vibro-tactile signals.

	abstract = {Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-based optical technique is becoming the right choice for the next-generation Internet infrastructure to transport high-speed Internet Protocol traffic. Today, wireless asynchronous transfer mode (WATM) network plays the leading role; undoubtedly it will be replaced with wireless WDM (WWDM) network to provide higher quality of service for mobile users. In addition many conventional and emerging applications, such as teleconferencing and distributed games, require multicasting increasingly. Many efforts to support multicasting for WATM networks have been offered, yet there are rarely addressed on WWDM networks. Moreover, conventional operations to set up and tear down optical connections in WDM networks are unable to apply directly to WWDM networks. User{\textquoteright}s mobility may make the operating optical-multicast-tree to change into very inefficient. The tree may expand and consume excessive resources, and even lost connection due to violating the associated QoS constraints. In this paper, a Constrained Optical Tree Migration Scheme (COTMS) is proposed to support real-time multicast services for WWDM networks. COTMS efficiently deals with the constrained tree migration problem and adapts easily to the operations of WDM. Simulation results reveal that COTMS can markedly reduce the resources used by per optical tree, thus achieving both low handoff-dropping/join-blocking rate and high-resource utilization. Moreover, COTMS is also suitable for ad-hoc networks with multiple different frequencies for multicast routing.},

The game allows players to select between trading, playing or pairing with other players. The game was played using playing-cards or using HP Ipaq devices equipped with Bluetooth, and players were either seated around a table or encouraged to move around the room. Activities during play were recorded and these data are analysed in terms of social networks. It was found that while the playing-cards led to attempts to apply the same type of activity in both seated and mobile conditions, the use of PDA led to differences in play. These differences were due to both technical, i.e., availability of players in the Bluetooth network, and social, i.e., visibility of players in the world and the activity of the Dealer. It is proposed that the manner in which the game was played changes when a mobile device is used whilst moving around, and that this is different to when the same device is used when sitting down.},

We argue that game developers will need to address these problems in order to realize the potential of voice in online multiplayer videogames.

How do you analyse the learning mechanisms of games when you are being reflexively engaged in the training materials and systems mapped into the text by the games{\textquoteright} designers? This article examines this {\textquoteright}crisis of representation{\textquoteright} in interpretive ethnographic research approaches to games research.},

We suggest an algorithm motivated by concepts from Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) in which an attack from one opponent is met with a response from the other which is refined in time to create an optimal response to that attack.. We refine the AIS algorithm in that we model the response with a probability vector rather than a population of antibodies. Some typical results are shown on the simple computer game.},

However, this autonomy may bring also some change in the interaction between users and game characters. Players may become less in charge of their characters and lose the power of complete motion or behavior control. On the other hand, characters may become more clever exhibiting much more interesting autonomous actions and behaviors. This paper presents, defines and discusses the concept of "influence", as an alternative to "direct" control of game characters, describing how influence can be achieved in computer games. To illustrate the notion of "influence" we will present a game called FantasyA where players interact with it by influencing the emotions of they semi-autonomous avatars using a tangible interface called SenToy. We show how "influence" was built into this game, the role of SenToy as an influencing device, and the reactions of the users to this type of control.},

	abstract = {Many commercial computer games allow a team of players to match their skills against another team, controlled by humans or by the computer. Most players prefer human opponents, since the artificial intelligence of a computer-controlled team is in general inferior. An adaptive mechanism for team-oriented artificial intelligence would allow computer-controlled opponents to adapt to human player behaviour, thereby providing a means of dealing with weaknesses in the game AI. Current commercial computer games lack challenging adaptive mechanisms. This paper proposes {\textquoteright}TEAM{\textquoteright}, a novel team-oriented adaptive mechanism which is inspired by evolutionary algorithms. The performance of TEAM is evaluated in an experiment involving an actual commercial computer game (the Capture The Flag team-based game mode of the popular commercial computer game Quake III). The experimental results indicate that TEAM succeeds in endowing computer-controlled opponents with successful adaptive performance. We therefore conclude that TEAM can be successfully applied to generate challenging adaptive opponent behaviour in team-oriented commercial computer games.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this special issue is to examine simulation/gaming as a trans-disciplinary field of inquiry and practice from the perspective of the science of design. The principle of indeterminacy applied to the social and human realm stipulates that the only way we can know human reality is by engaging it. Gaming represents a particularly powerful approach to engage people in shaping learning communities and in enhancing communities of practice. Principles and methods for designing gaming/simulations as such are well documented in the literature. In the 1970s and 1980s the communities of gamers have paid special attention to the methods and techniques of game design and model building. For example the proceedings of the annual international conferences of the International Simulation And Gaming Association (ISAGA) of 1979 focuses on {\textquotedblleft}How to build a simulation/game{\textquotedblright} (Bruin, K. et al. 1979). It is out of the scope of this special issue to discuss in detail the specifications of simulation/game design or to assess particular design methods. Focus is on the ramifications of simulation/game design and its impact on the broader social context of use. Simulation/game design does not happen in a social vacuum. It is part of a common understanding of associations such as ISAGA, NASAGA, SAGSET, ABSEL, JASAG, and SAGSAGA, which propagate proper design and use of simulation games, the debriefing included. It is also embedded in the practice on how to involve the user or client system in the design process. Moreover, gamers aim at influencing social practice by improving the competencies of individual actors and social agents involved.<br />

Alienation variables contributed significantly, though modestly, to variance explained in the use of violence-oriented websites, but not to the composite measure. Alienation from school and family also appeared to partially mediate effects of sensation seeking and aggression on use of violent Internet content. A negative feedback loop model for linking uses and gratifications approaches to the study of effects of violent media content on adolescents is suggested.},

Assessments were made of the impact of simulator sickness and of sense of presence on the phobogenic effectiveness of TVEDGs. Participants reported low levels of simulator sickness, and the results indicate that simulator sickness had no significant impact on either anxiety or sense of presence. Group differences, correlations, and regression analyses indicate a synergistic relationship between presence and anxiety.

	abstract = {While shows like The X-Files and 24 have merged conspiracy theories with popular science (fictions), some video games have been pushing the narrative even further. Electronic Art\&$\#$39;s Majestic game was released in July 2001 and quickly generated media buzz with its unusual multi-modal gameplay. Mixing phone calls, faxes, instant messaging, real and \&quot;fake\&$\#$39; websites, and email, the game provides a fascinating case of an attempt at new directions for gaming communities. Through story, mode of playing, and use of technology, Majestic highlights the uncertain status of knowledge, community and self in a digital age; at the same time, it allows examination of alternative ways of understanding games\&$\#$39; role and purpose in the larger culture. Drawing on intricate storylines involving government conspiracies, techno-bio warfare, murder and global terror, players were asked to solve mysteries in the hopes of preventing a devastating future of domination. Because the game drew in both actual and Majestic-owned/-designed websites, it constantly pushed those playing the game right to borders where simulation collides with \&quot; factuality\&$\#$39;. Given the wide variety of \&quot;legitimate\&$\#$39; conspiracy theory, alien encounters and alternative science web pages, users often could not distinguish when they were leaving the game\&$\#$39;s pages and venturing into \&quot; real\&$\#$39; World Wide Web sites. Its further use of AOL\&$\#$39;s instant messenger system, in which gamers spoke not only to bots but to other players, pushed users to evaluate constantly both the status of those they were talking to and the information being provided. Additionally, the game required players to occupy unfamiliar subject positions, ones where agency was attenuated, and which subsequently generated a multi-layered sense of unease among players. This mix of authentic and staged information in conjunction with technologically mediated roles highlights what are often seen as phenomenon endemic to the Internet itself; that is, the destabilization of categories of knowing, relating, and being.

Furthermore, almost all of the research to date has concentrated on arcade or console games. More recently, the Internet has become a new medium in which players can play videogames. Since there is no published research in this area, some "benchmark" data on which future research can build was collected from two online gaming fan sites. Sociodemographics showed that the majority of players were male (approximately 85\%). Over 60\% of players were older than 19 years. The data provide clear evidence that the game clientele is very much an adult profile and suggest a different picture to the stereotypical image of an adolescent online gamer. The stereotype of the typical online player being a socially withdrawn young male with limited sex role identity appears to be misplaced.},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid development of computer and information technology, 3D modeling and rendering capabilities are becoming increasingly important in many applications, including industrial design, architecture, CAD/CAM, video games, and medical imaging. Since 3D mesh models often have huge amounts of the data, it is time-consuming to retrieve front a storage device or to download from the network. Most 3D viewing applications need to obtain the entire file of a 3D model in order to display the model, even when the user is interested only in a low-resolution version of the model. Therefore, progressive coding that enables multiresolution transmission of 3D models is desired. In this paper, we propose the progressive coding scheme of 3D meshes with texture, in which we convert irregular meshes to semi-regular using texture coordinates, map them on planes, and apply 2D image coding algorithm to mesh compression. As our method uses the wavelet transform, the encoded bitstream has a progressive nature. We gain high compression rate with the same visual quality as original models.},

An experiment to separate these two kinds of effects was carried out by using a traditional version and a computer-supported version of Pegopolis, a solitaire game. The two versions were exactly the same except that they were played by moving pieces either on a real board or on a virtual computer-presented board. The performance levels and strategies followed during the game by the 40 undergraduates who took part in the experiment were not significantly different in the real and virtual conditions. None of the participants transferred playing strategies or practice from one version of the game to the other. Scores were not affected by gender or by the studies pursued by participants, the habit of playing games in the traditional manner or playing video games, or intelligence. Retrospective reports did not support differences in the subjective experience between the two versions. Results showed that video games, when they do not make much use of the computer{\textquoteright}s special features, produce effects because of the situations they simulate rather than because of features of the computer itself.},

	abstract = {In the closing weeks of 2002, video games were featured in various popular American news publications and media outlets such as Wired, Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek and Time Magazine. It is becoming increasingly apparent that video games are no longer child\&$\#$39;s play, but rather that they are poised to become a major entertainment form for the twenty-first century. Social analysts and media scholars must begin to formulate an understanding of this emerging mass-consumer phenomenon because it will increasingly impact social and economic structures of post-industrial societies. Part of the tremendous value generated by the American video-game industry is tied into broad global economic shifts that have created a space where services and ephemeral products, such as software, can be created and cheaply distributed. The predominance of \&quot; high-tech\&$\#$39; production, the rise of the Internet, and the cultural capital associated with computerization all have contributed to the rise of hobbyist software developers that currently tinker with commercial video games and freely add to them increasing levels of sophistication. This paper sees video-game programmer hobbyists as a source of some of the significant value that the video-game industry generates, and understands the role of the programmer hobbyists through the lens of theories on post-industrial work. My analysis situates the work of hobbyists on the Internet within the context of post-Fordism and explores some of the motivations for this unwaged work. In the sections that follow, I will analyse the potential value of the work hobbyist do as well as analyse its transition to paid work as some commercial software developers experiment with incorporating these fan bases into the game design process.

This paper examines the relationship between gender and the social and spatial organization of computer gaming. The concept of leisure constraints and resistance are utilised to examine the extent to which technologically-mediated leisure activities, such as computer gaming, are part of wider changes in female access to private and public leisure spaces. Computer gaming is still perceived as a highly gendered activity which has the potential to reinforce traditional conceptualizations of masculinity, femininity and associated leisure activities. However, the popularity of domestic and online gaming among females, and the development of female gaining clans, highlights that leisure activities and spaces are becoming less gendered, and can provide sites for resistance to societal notions of the gender appropriateness of leisure activities.},

Using popular game titles as examples, the book explores why these games appeal to such a predominantly male audience, and investigates the key differences between male and female entertainment criteria.

The size and popularity of the games industry stands out in contrast to the lack of understanding of computer gaming as a serious leisure activity. Previous research on computer game playing has tended to focus on the negative aspects of gaming such as aggression, addiction, and social isolation, rather than viewing it as an activity which forms an important part of many people{\textquoteright}s leisure lifestyles. This paper presents a very different image of gaming and gamers. It investigates computer gaming as a serious and competitive leisure activity. The paper looks at the gendered use and negotiation of leisure spaces by gamers in the context of the expansion of gaming into space and place outside the traditional domestic contexts and which blur boundaries between domestic and public leisure spaces. As such it assumes a perspective on computer gaming in which the activity is seen as part of the everyday leisure routines of gamers rather than a spectacular and notable stimulus or event. The paper argues that although certain aspects of computer gaming involve technological mediation and disembodiment, the changes in gaming texts and contexts have not radically improved the leisure constraints associated with gendered space and technologically-mediated activities. To this end, the paper draws on the existing gaming literature and preliminary ethnographic research of public competitive gaming.},

	abstract = {Console based video games are an increasingly familiar and engaging technology in the living room and as such, warrant critical attention. Considerations of their impact on the home have been widely regarded by new media academics as technological innovation and by social scientists as symptomatic of a decline in social and familial connectedness. In an attempt to move the debate beyond discussions of machine functionality and social crisis, this paper argues for a reframing of some of the ways we think about the impact of entertainment technologies on the home. It presents the notion of the digital hearth as a concept that shows how cultural meanings associated with the home can be transformed through gaming and changing patterns of consumption. The research examines the domestication of the console through cultural histories of the living room, the social context of electronic media, and ethnographic studies. It argues that the concept of the digital hearth represents a re-organization of the spaces in which collective engagement occurs and a shifting of the cultural norms associated with that collective engagement. In these spaces not only does the living room become the site of collective engagement but also the form of that engagement changes with the digital hearth acting as the focal point around social interaction. The paper traces parallels between the appropriation of television and of radio into the home and the domestication of the console while arguing that the console represents a shifting of spatial and social norms of domestication from previous electronic media. In addition it represents gaming in the home as symptomatic of changes from public to private forms of entertainment which constitutes a changing geographic base for social networks.

Although male hoverflies have been observed to move in a manner consistent with motion camouflage to track females, the successful application of the technique has not previously been demonstrated. This article describes the implementation and results of a psychophysical experiment suggesting that humans are susceptible to motion camouflage. The experiment masqueraded as a computer-game competition. The basis of the competition was a game designed to test the comparative success of different predatory-approach strategies. The experiment showed that predators were able to approach closer to their prey (the player of the game) before being detected when using motion camouflage than when using other approach strategies tested. For an autonomous predator, the calculation of a motion-camouflage approach is a non-trivial problem. It was, therefore, of particular interest that in the game the players were deceived by motion-camouflage predators controlled by artificial neural systems operating using realistic levels of input information. It is suggested that these results are especially of interest to biologists, visual psychophysicists, military engineers and computer-games designers.},

	abstract = {Research on violent television and films, video games, and music reveals unequivocal evidence that media violence increases the likelihood of aggressive and violent behavior in both immediate and long-term contexts. The effects appear larger for milder than for more severe forms of aggression, but the effects on severe forms of violence are also substantial (r = .13 to .32) when compared with effects of other violence risk factors or medical effects deemed important by the medical community (e.g., effect of aspirin on heart attacks). The research base is large; diverse in methods, samples, and media genres; and consistent in overall findings. The evidence is clearest within the most extensively researched domain, television and film violence. The growing body of video-game research yields essentially the same conclusions. Short-term exposure increases the likelihood of physically and verbally aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts, and aggressive emotions. Recent large-scale longitudinal studies provide converging evidence linking frequent exposure to violent media in childhood with aggression later in life, including physical assaults and spouse abuse. Because extremely violent criminal behaviors (e.g., forcible rape, aggravated assault, homicide) are rare, new longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to estimate accurately how much habitual childhood exposure to media violence increases the risk for extreme violence. Well-supported theory delineates why and when exposure to media violence increases aggression and violence. Media violence produces short-term increases by priming existing aggressive scripts and cognitions, increasing physiological arousal, and triggering an automatic tendency to imitate observed behaviors. Media violence produces long-term effects via several types of learning processes leading to the acquisition of lasting (and automatically accessible) aggressive scripts, interpretational schemas, and aggression-supporting beliefs about social behavior, and by reducing individuals\&$\#$39; normal negative emotional responses to violence (i.e., desensitization). Certain characteristics of viewers (e.g., identification with aggressive characters), social environments (e.g., parental influences), and media content (e.g., attractiveness of the perpetrator) can influence the degree to which media violence affects aggression, but there are some inconsistencies in research results. This research also suggests some avenues for preventive intervention (e.g., parental supervision, interpretation, and control of children\&$\#$39;s media use). However, extant research on moderators suggests that no one is wholly immune to the effects of media violence. Recent surveys reveal an extensive presence of violence in modern media. Furthermore, many children and youth spend an inordinate amount of time consuming violent media. Although it is clear that reducing exposure to media violence will reduce aggression and violence, it is less clear what sorts of interventions will produce a reduction in exposure. The sparse research literature suggests that counterattitudinal and parental-mediation interventions are likely to yield beneficial effects, but that media literacy interventions by themselves are unsuccessful. Though the scientific debate over whether media violence increases aggression and violence is essentially over, several critical tasks remain. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed for a better understanding of underlying psychological processes, which eventually should lead to more effective interventions. Large-scale longitudinal studies would help specify the magnitude of media-violence effects on the most severe types of violence. Meeting the larger societal challenge of providing children and youth with a much healthier media diet may prove to be more difficult and costly, especially if the scientific, news, public policy, and entertainment communities fail to educate the general public about the real risks of media-violence exposure to children and youth.

To this end, we assume the behavior of game characters to be a function that maps the current game state onto a reaction. We will show that neural networks architectures are well suited to learn such functions and by means of a popular commercial game we demonstrate that agent behaviors can be learned from observation.},

	pages = {1258-1266},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several cross-sectional studies reported that heavier children eat breakfast less often. However, no longitudinal studies have addressed whether skipping breakfast leads to excessive weight gain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether skipping breakfast was prospectively associated with changes in body fatness. METHODS: A cohort of 414 000 boys and girls from all over the US, 9- to 14-y-old in 1996, returned annual mailed questionnaires (1996 - 1999) for the Growing Up Today Study. We analyzed change in body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)) over three 1-y periods among children who reported breakfast frequency. RESULTS: Children who reported that they never eat breakfast had lower energy intakes than those who eat breakfast nearly every day. Children who were more physically active reported higher energy intakes, as did those who reported more time watching television/ videos and playing videogames. Like previous studies, skipping breakfast was associated with overweight, cross-sectionally. However, overweight children who never ate breakfast lost BMI over the following year compared to overweight children who ate breakfast nearly every day (boys: - 0.66 kg/m(2) (s.e. = 0.22); girls: - 0.50 kg/m(2) (s.e. = 0.14)). But normal weight children who never ate breakfast gained weight relative to peers who ate breakfast nearly every day ( boys: + 0.21 kg/m(2) (s.e. = 0.13); girls: + 0.08 kg/m(2) (s. e. = 0.05)). Breakfast frequency was positively correlated with self-reported quality of schoolwork. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight children who never eat breakfast may lose body fat, but normal weight children do not. Since numerous studies link skipping breakfast to poorer academics, children should be encouraged to eat breakfast.},

We further consider what sort of skills or knowledge could be acquired through the use of computer games with a particular emphasis on literacy. Finally we question current trends in the development of the virtual student learning space and suggest that some rethinking may be required if virtual learning environments are to be embraced by students.

	abstract = {This paper examines the fan movement surrounding Lara Croft, a computer- generated character who has appeared in computer games, comic books, men\&$\#$39; s magazines, promotional tours, music videos, calendars, action figures and motion pictures. A fixture of the pop-culture landscape since 1996, Croft embodies or incarnates a nexus of cultural, economic, and technological forces, whose shared characteristic is their powerful hold on a vast audience base. Lara Croft is nothing without her fans. As the founding member of a new mode of celebrity system featuring female digital stars, Croft\&$\#$39;s essentially technological nature - the mode of her signification and circulation - produces continuities and ruptures with traditional fan practices, reframing our understandings of categories such as \&quot;fan\&$\#$39;, \&quot;audience\&$\#$39;, \&quot;character\&$\#$39;, and \&quot;text\&$\#$39; in relation to a mediascape whose speed and multiplicity mark not just postmodernism, but adaptive responses to postmodernity. From this perspective, Lara Croft is less a singular entity than a coping strategy, a mediation of media. The concerns of this project are, first, to examine Lara Croft as a conjunction of industrial and representational forces intended to promote certain types of reception and consumption; second, to assess the ways in which her peculiar semiotic status - simultaneously open-ended and concrete - renders her available for appropriation and elaboration by fans; and, finally, to discuss the ways in which Croft\&$\#$39;s fandom opens up new debates about the relationship between texts, audiences, and technology.

Studies show that adults{\textquoteright} comments before or during media exposure can reduce the impact of violent programming on children aggressiveness under some circumstances. Experiments involving more extensive media literacy curricula show that some approaches can alter attitudes toward media violence and, in a few cases, intervene in aggressive behavior. Studies of the impact of antiviolence media productions reveal that although such efforts can be effective, unanticipated "boomerang" effects are prevalent. Overall, the effectiveness of the 3 types of interventions was highly variable, and age and gender differences were prominent. The findings suggest that more research is needed to determine the best approaches to developing parental interventions, media literacy strategies, and prosocial media presentations for reducing youth violence.},

Research using computer games in contextual interference studies has yielded a large effect (f = .50) with a random practice schedule advantage during transfer. These investigations had a total of 36 and 72 acquisition trials, respectively. The present study tested this prediction by having 72 college students, who were randomly assigned to a blocked or random practice schedule, practice 102 trials of three computer-game tasks across three days. After a 24-hr. interval, 6 retention and 5 transfer trials were performed. Dependent variables were time to complete an event in seconds and number of errors. No significant differences were found for retention and transfer.

Cross-sectional studies have suggested that children who were less physically active and children who watched more television (TV) had more excess body weight, but no large nationwide longitudinal studies have addressed whether children who change their personal levels of activity or inactivity, from one year to the next, experience changes in adiposity. Our objective is to study the association between change in body mass index (BMI) over 1 year and same year change in recreational physical activity and change in recreational inactivity (TV/videos/video games). Design. Cohort study using data from 2 mailed questionnaires, 1 year apart. Participants. A total of 11 887 boys and girls, aged 10 to 15, who returned questionnaires in both 1997 and 1998 as part of the Growing Up Today Study. Outcome Measure. Change in BMI from 1997-1998, accounting for increases in BMI associated with growth and development. Results. An increase in physical activity from 1997 1998 was associated with decreasing relative BMI in girls (-0.06 kg/m(2) per hour increase in daily activity; 95\% confidence interval : -0.11, -0.01) and in overweight boys (-0.22 kg/m(2); CI: -0.33, -0.10). An increase in inactivity was associated with increasing BMI in girls (-0.05 kg/m(2) per hour increase in daily TV/videos/video games; CI: +0.02, +0.08). Effects were generally stronger among overweight children. Increasing time doing aerobics/dancing and walking were associated with BMI declines for some groups of children. Conclusions. Many children may benefit by increasing their physical activity and by reducing time watching TV or videos and playing video games. In particular, 2 activities accessible to most children, aerobics/dancing and walking, also appeared beneficial.},

Research Methods and Procedures: The study population was drawn from the 1997 China Health National Survey (1385 children, ages 6 to 11 years), conducted with a representative sample from nine provinces. The 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BMI charts were used to calculate "at risk of overweight" as those above the 85th percentile. Three days of 24-hour recall dietary data and detailed questions on physical activity and inactivity for the previous 7 days were used. Results: 9.4\% of the children were classified as overweight. Weekly mean and range of hours spent watching television/ videos, playing video games, studying, and in inactive transport were 5.1 (0 to 35), 0.3 (0 to 10), 4.7 (0 to 60), and 0.14 (0 to 4.2), respectively. Television/video viewing and studying did not differ in any meaningful manner between overweight and normal weight children. Snacking is inconsequential in China, comprising only 0.9\% of energy intake. Discussion: Chinese children are less overweight, less inactive, and less likely to ingest calories as snacks than children in the U.S. The absence of impact of these measures of inactivity, which are below an hour per day for the average Chinese child, indicate the possible value of limiting television viewing and other types of inactivity in other countries. Modern Western-style television programming and advertising started to come to China after 1997; therefore, extensive changes in television viewing patterns are expected to emerge.},

Design: Cross-sectional cohort design. Participants and Setting: Seven hundred forty-three high school students from 2 inner-city public schools and 1 private school. Methods: Students completed a self-administered questionnaire that addressed time spent in physical activity, time spent in sedentary pursuits, musculoskeletal pain, and psychosocial issues and were also measured for height and weight. Main Outcome Measure: Level of physical activity (low, moderate, high). Results: There were more girls than boys in the low and moderate physical activity groups and more boys than girls in the high activity group. Ordinal logistic regression showed that increased time spent in "productive sedentary behavior" (reading or doing homework and working on computers) was associated with increased physical activity (odds ratio, 1.7-1 95\% confidence interval, 1.2-2.4), as was time spent working (odds ratio, 13;95\%confidence interval, 1.2-1.4). Time spent watching television and playing video games was not associated with decreased physical activity. Conclusions: Physical activity was not inversely associated with watching television or playing video games, but was positively associated with productive sedentary behavior and part-time work. Some students appear capable of managing their time better than others. Future studies should explore the ability of students to manage their time and also determine what characteristics are conducive to better time management.},

Preexisting empathy and attitudes towards violence were positively related to the corresponding vignette scores. Long-term exposure to violent video games contributed to lower empathy vignette scores. Playing a violent versus a nonviolent game did not affect vignette responses.

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of male fire-related injuries at our burn center and to investigate the use of fire images in toy packaging. An aisle-by-aisle search was conducted at a national toy store. Toys with fire images on their packaging were identified. Target gender and the setting in which the fire was displayed also were recorded. Only toys with clearly visible flames on their packaging were included. We reviewed our TRACS database from April 1997 to May 1999 for fire-related injuries to children admitted to our institution as a result of playing with fire. Review of toy stores revealed 404 toys with packaging containing fire images. Of these, 97\% (393 of 404) were targeted to males. Video games were the leading category of flame-related packaging (208 of 404), followed by toy car/truck displays (84 of 404). Packaging for girls{\textquoteright} toys had safe and contained settings, whereas boys{\textquoteright} toys used settings that were uncontrolled and associated with speed and weapons.

Children imitate life with toys and use play to experiment with new behavior. Boys are receiving a powerful, consistent message from images of fire on toy packaging.

By examining successful stories, one can easily identify the strategic factors responsible for such a success, and the greater the success, the more evident those factors are. Timing, strategic positioning, pricing policies, lead-time - everything goes back to the place where it fits best, like a beautiful mosaic. Even competitors\&$\#$39; mistakes become more evident, their dull misunderstanding of what the winner was planning as every successful move leads to an even more successful one. The case of Sony PlayStation, the most successful digital games console ever, is no exception and the temptation to explain the rationale behind such an achievement is almost irresistible. As this paper tries to suggest, sometimes ex- post rationalizations hide or avoid part of the truth. Despite PlayStation\&$\#$39;s success, Sony\&$\#$39;s strategic choices were, on more than one occasion, driven more by lucky coincidence than by long-range planning. Furthermore, this paper shows how some of the strategic factors behind PlayStation\&$\#$39;s winning run sprang from decisions taken by lack of alternatives, and that only in the very end was Sony able to understand their full profit potential.

Models consisting of child characteristics, demographics, family characteristics, and parental well-being predictors accounted for more of the variation in media use (television and video games) by European Americans and Hispanic Americans than they did for African Americans. Generally, variables predicted total use of television similarly for the 3 ethnic groups tested. Parental education predicted use of educational media only for European Americans. Electronic video game use varied almost exclusively by the age and gender of the child. The very different patterns for television and electronic game use suggest that these media may fulfill different functions for children and families.},

The game is played in rounds and in each round both the hunter and the rabbit are located at a node of the graph. Between rounds both the hunter and the rabbit can stay at the current node or move to another node. The hunter is assumed to be restricted to the graph G: in every round, the hunter can move using at most one edge. For the rabbit we investigate two models: in one model the rabbit is restricted to the same graph as the hunter, and in the other model the rabbit is unrestricted, i.e., it can jump to an arbitrary node in every round. We say that the rabbit is caught as soon as hunter and rabbit are located at the same node in a round. The goal of the hunter is to catch the rabbit in as few rounds as possible, whereas the rabbit aims to maximize the number of rounds until it is caught. Given a randomized hunter strategy for G, the escape length for that strategy is the worst case expected number of rounds it takes the hunter to catch the rabbit, where the worst case is with regard to all (possibly randomized) rabbit strategies. Our main result is a hunter strategy for general graphs with an escape length of only O(n log(diam(G))) against restricted as well as unrestricted rabbits. This bound is close to optimal since Omega(n) is a trivial lower bound on the escape length in both models. Furthermore, we prove that our upper bound is optimal up to constant factors against unrestricted rabbits.},

	abstract = {Lighting design is an important element of scene composition. Designers use lighting to influence viewers{\textquoteright} perception by evoking moods, directing their gaze to important areas, and conveying dramatic tension. Lighting is a very time consuming task; designers typically spend hours manipulating lights{\textquoteright} colors, positions, and angles to create a lighting design that accommodates dramatic action and tension. Such manual design is inappropriate for interactive narrative, because the spatial and dramatic characteristics of an interactive scene, including dramatic tension, camera location, and character actions, change unpredictably, necessitating continual redesign as the scene progresses. In this paper, we present a lighting design system, called ELE (Expressive Lighting Engine), that automatically, in real-time, adjusts angles, positions, and colors of lights to accommodate the dramatic and spatial characteristics of a scene, while conforming to the established style and ensuring visual continuity. ELE uses constraint-based non-linear optimization algorithms to configure lights using cost functions formulated based on traditional film and theatrical lighting design theory.},

	abstract = {The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) provides many great features, such as sufficient addressing space, mobility, and security; MIPv6 is one of the most important protocols for next generation mobile Internet. Simultaneously, with the rapid improvement of wireless technologies, the real-time multi-media IP services such as video on demand, videoconference, interactive games, IP telephony and video IP phone will be delivered in the near future. Thus, to furnish accurate QoS for real-time services is one of the most important thing in the next generation mobile Internet. Although RSVP, which is a resource reservation protocol, processes signaling messages to establish QoS paths between senders and receivers, RSVP was originally designed for stationary networks and not aware of the mobility of MNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel RSVP extension to support real-time services in Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) environments. For intra-site mobility, the concept of QoS Agent (QA) is proposed to handle the RSVP QoS update messages and provide the advanced reservation models for real-time services. For inter-site mobility, IP multicast can help to invite inter-site QAs to make pre-reservation and minimize the service disruption caused by re-routing the data path during handover. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme over HMIPv6 is more suitable for real-time services than the famous RSVP tunnel-based solution.},

	abstract = {This article examines one of the most popular computer games The Sims to consider whether the shared understanding of the game\&$\#$39;s \&quot;rules\&$\#$39; can be understood through the concept of genre. The main argument is that the genre being used is \&quot;real life\&$\#$39;. The game\&$\#$39;s creators are assuming the players share with them, and with each other, an understanding of real life, which can be transposed into the game world. The article explores this notion of a real-life narrative that is shared, by considering the ways in which family and other relationships are both conceptualized and played out in the game. Whilst real life as genre is problematized here, the tensions and conflicts of contemporary real-world conceptualizations of family and other relationships do appear to be represented in the game. What is interesting then, given this, are the ways in which players negotiate the gameplay. The article concludes by suggesting that players are active agents negotiating both the game\&$\#$39; s version of real life, and their own real-world experiences.

	abstract = {New media technologies have long tapped into social hopes and anxieties, and the turmoil that follows their appearance offers a window into the social tensions of the time. Clashing sets of utopian and dystopian visions have typically resulted in an ambivalent portrayal of such technologies. Video games prove to be no exception. Through a content analysis of media frames in the USA\&$\#$39;s three leading news magazines, the reception and presentation of video-game technology was tracked over a thirty-year period, 1970-2000. The resulting patterns tell a story of vilification and partial redemption, owing to the mainstream acceptance of the medium and the aging user base. Fears of the negative effects from the new technology were hypothesized to come from a routine set of conservative worries. The results support this hypothesis. Moreover, the frames surrounding games, especially in the 1980s, reveal many of the key social tensions of the times, primarily those surrounding gender roles, the separation of age and racial groups, and the role of female parents within an increasingly technological society. The place of video games within the larger context of media history, and the social causes of the frames are discussed.

The measure of use of media violence included viewing action films, playing violent computer and video games, and visiting violence-oriented Internet sites by students from 20 middle schools in 10 different regions in the United States. The findings appear largely consistent with the proposed model. In particular, concurrent effects of aggressiveness on violent-media use and concurrent and lagged effects of violent media use on aggressiveness were found. The implications of this model for theorizing about media effects on youth, and for bridging active audience with media effects perspectives, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Currently, several million people have accounts in massively multiplayer online games. The population of virtual worlds has grown rapidly since 1996; significantly, each world also seems to grow its own economy, with production, assets and trade with Earth economies. This paper explores two questions about these developments. First, will these economies grow in importance? Second, if they do grow, how will that affect real-world economies and governments? To shed light on the first question, the paper presents a simple choice model of the demand for game time. The model reveals a certain puzzle about puzzles and games: in the demand for these kinds of interactive entertainment goods, people reveal that they are willing to pay money to be constrained. Still, the nature of games as a produced good suggests that technological advances, and heavy competition, will drive the future development of virtual worlds. If virtual worlds do become a large part of the daily life of humans, their development may have an impact on the macroeconomies of Earth. It will also raise certain constitutional issues, since it is not clear, today, exactly who has jurisdiction over these new economies.},

In Artefact, Innocent actively investigates the digital investment of life in avatars as they operate in an interactive game environment.

The examples we show in this paper are taken from computer games and other tools we have developed to set students in a scenario in which they must collaborate in order to succeed. This paper also presents diverse forms of structuring positive interdependence in software tools based on the interface design to ensure that students think we instead of me.},

The generation of animated human figures especially in crowd scenes has many applications in such domains as the special effects industry, computer games or for the simulation of the evacuation from crowded areas. Currently such scenes have to be created by human animators using dedicated software packages. This is both expensive and time-consuming. FreeWill combines and extends two existing architectures - Funge{\textquoteright}s cognitive architecture and the recent SAC concept. Additionally it puts emphasis on strong design and provides easy co-operation of different software packages.},

In order to control the motions of the fish interactively as in computer games, we attempted to learn the motion properties of the fish in this video sequence. Some of the motion parameters of the fish were extracted from the video frames and then trained using a neural network. This trained information provided motion control for generating fish animation. In the proposed system, we also generate arbitrary video loop lengths for rendering and animating fish. It is not necessary that the video samples in these video loops be played in sequence. Furthermore, we can adapt both the video loop and neural network techniques in order to control the fish motions interactively and to maintain visual smoothness in fish animation.},

	abstract = {The domain of services for mobile communication terminals has long become a fast-moving target. Indeed, this domain has been affected by a continuous stream of technological advances on aspects ranging from physical infrastructures to mobile terminals. As a result, services for this domain are known to be very unpredictable and volatile. This situation is even worse when considering services relying heavily on multimedia activities (e.g., games, audio and/or video messages, etc.). Such an application area is very sensitive to a large variety of aspects such as terminal capabilities (graphics, CPU, etc.), bandwidth, service provider{\textquoteright}s billing policies, QoS, and user expectations. To address these issues, we present a paradigm based on domain-specific languages (DSLs) that enables networking and telecommunication experts to quickly develop robust communication services. Importantly, we propose implementation strategies to enable this paradigm to be supported by existing software infrastructures. Our DSL paradigm is uniformly used to develop a platform for communication services, named Nova. This platform addresses various domains of services including telephony services, e-mail processing, remote-document processing, stream processing, and HTTP resource adaption.},

	abstract = {The beginning of the 21st century is being defined by new politics, the new economy, the information society, techno sciences, multiculturalism, globalisation and new lifestyles, all of which have some impact on art. Art is beginning to omit the nature of the stable artefact as well as the traditional functions of representation and embellishment and is becoming post-aesthetical and process-like. Because the key feature of the finished and stable artwork is not as important as it used to be, the ontological question of what art is has also become an issue of no great importance. Instead, relation questions regarding the interaction between art and techno-sciences, new technologies, the new economy and the new politics have arisen. The key concern of this essay is the highlighting of the cultural turns which have, in these days of the Internet, techno-sciences, the new economy and globalisation, influenced the new concepts and placements of contemporary art and digital textuality. Art 3.5 (a technical term used for the contemporary art of processes, installations, computer games, events, artistic communications, performances and art worlds) is placed in life in reality version 6.1 (another technical term), which has also mutated and undergone many changes. From the author{\textquoteright}s point of view the changes in the art field derive from the parallel changes in art{\textquoteright}s subsystem of reality 6.1. Therefore, one can determine in reality at the beginning of the 21(st) century that even techno-sciences, new technologies, the new means of communication, the new politics and new economy have, in a way, become artistic.},

How much detail do we really need? Polygon counts over a few million imply that on average each polygon paints less than a single pixel, making use of polygon shading hardware wasteful. We consider the problem of determining how much realism is required for a variety of applications. We discuss how current trends in computer graphics hardware, and in particular of graphics cards targeted at the computer games industry, will help or hinder achievement of these requirements. With images now being so convincingly realistic in many cases, critical faculties are often suspended and the images are accepted as correct and truthful although they may well be incorrect and sometimes misleading or untruthful. Display resolution has remained largely constant in spatial terms for the last twenty years and in terms of the number of pixels has increased by less than an order of magnitude. If the long-promised breakthroughs in display technology are finally realised, how should we use the increased resolution?},

	abstract = {Background: The impact of gender and hand dominance on operative performance may be a subject of prejudice among surgeons, reportedly leading to discrimination and lack of professional promotion. However, very little objective evidence is available yet on the matter. This study was conducted to identify factors that influence surgeons{\textquoteright} performance, as measured by a virtual reality computer simulator for laparoscopic surgery. Methods: This study included 25 surgical residents who had limited experience with laparoscopic surgery, having performed fewer than 10 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The participants were registered according to their gender, hand dominance, and experience with computer games. All of the participants performed 10 repetitions of the six tasks on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) within 1 month. Assessment of laparoscopic skills was based on three parameters measured by the simulator: time, errors, and economy of hand movement. Results: Differences in performance existed between the compared groups. Men completed the tasks in less time than women (p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test), but there was no statistical difference between the genders in the number of errors and unnecessary movements. Individuals with right hand dominance performed fewer unnecessary movements (p = 0.045, Mann-Whitney test), and there was a trend toward better results in terms of time and errors among the residence with right hand dominance than among those with left dominance. Users of computer games made fewer errors than nonusers (p = 0.035, Mann-Whitney test). Conclusions: The study provides objective evidence of a difference in laparoscopic skills between surgeons differing gender, hand dominance, and computer experience. These results may influence the future development of training program for laparoscopic surgery. They also pose a challenge to individuals responsible for the selection and training of the residents.},

Once the contents of the services performed by the localiser have been ascertained, a profile emerges for that particular species of translators: that of the {\textquoteright}ultimate translator{\textquoteright} in terms of domain specialisation, writing and rewriting skills, control of ergonomics, quality management abilities, project management skills, project team management know-how, and naturally enough, mastery of anything that has to do with computer science, computer technologies and computer-assisted whatnots. The author thinks that translator profiles should be upgraded in such a way that all translators become able to grab chunks of the new localisation markets. His choice would be to give the new translators all of the skills and competencies required of some kind of {\textquoteright}engineer (ingenieur) in multilingual and multimedia communication{\textquoteright}, whose abilities and markets would include all forms of what, under the name of localisation, is but a thrice specialised and better paid variant of translation. The emergence of localisation as a collection of new markets, a set of not so new skills, and a new frontier is the time for translators to decide where they stand and how much they are prepared to change, and for training institutions to adapt to the new challenges. That means that institutions must teach localisations as a matter of course but also reposition themselves more radically as schools of multilingual, multimedia engineering so that their trainees may keep abreast of changes that are already reshaping demand by work providers.},

Following this, five expert players and five novice players were asked to play the game again. All game play processes, using a think-aloud protocol, were videotaped for further analysis. The analysis results showed that the relationship between the operating time and the steps of the novice group were more scattered than the expert group. The significant difference between the expert and novice groups was the percentage of different thinking types. In the game playing process, the expert players used more analogical thinking while the novice players tended to use trial-and-error thinking.},

MSL provides high-level components encapsulating advanced services (e.g. positioning, database query, path search, games, etc.), that can be easily integrated in multimedia presentations. This allows building modular applications that provide information-rich services to the general public through a coherent and homogeneous multimedia HCI, that can be learned with low mental workload. On the other hand, MADE hides the low-level aspects of multimedia and service management, allowing designers to focus on the modalities of presentation of information and on user interaction.

This functionality is an essential requirement for the inclusion of arbitrary 3D models, as generated by standard CAD or animation software, into teleconferencing sessions. A key aim of this work is to show that a large part of the required functionality can be developed in a way so that it is reusable for other applications such as shared whiteboards or networked computer games. Our method therefore consists of both an application dependent part that handles the specific tasks required for sharing 3D models, and of a number of generic services such as synchronization, scalable support for latecomers, and the ability to record and replay sessions. The generic services are based on an abstract media model and the RTP/I application level protocol for distributed interactive media. Any other application for a medium that shares this model and that uses RTP/I may reuse these generic services. We have implemented a prototype called TeCo3D demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.},

First we will look more closely at the computer game itself: the circumstances in which it was published, its frame story and its game play. Next, we will see how it was received by the Spectrum and Amstrad game community and how it is still highly valued by retro video game enthusiasts today. We will look at four reasons for the popularity of Head Over Heels given by the designers and the game community and propose two more, i.e. its interactive layout and its semantics. In the theoretical interlude we will go deeper into the history and nature of the concepts of "immersion" and "interactivity" in recent digital cultural theory. Finally, we will zoom in on the interactive framework of Head Over Heels using the concepts and theory sketched before, and attempt to substantiate the claim that signification plays a role in the appreciation and reception of interactive media objects. {\textcopyright} 2001-2004 Game Studies.},

Science fiction themes and images surface sometimes quite unexpectedly in everyday life, in TV commercials and video clips, not to speak of computer games.

However, a major drawback has been that ray tracing requires access to the entire scene data base. This is particularly problematic for hardware implementations that only have a limited amount of dedicated on-board memory. In this paper we propose a virtual memory architecture for ray tracing that efficiently renders scenes many times larger than the available on-board memory. Instead of wasting large dedicated memory on a graphics card, scene data is stored in main memory, and on-board memory is used only as a cache. We show that typical scenes from computer games only require less than 8 MB of cache memory while 64 NIB are sufficient even for scenes with GBs of geometry and textures. The caching approach also minimizes the bandwidth between the graphics subsystem and the host such that even a standard PCI connection is sufficient.},

	abstract = {Much of the current critical and theoretical literature on new media, including video and computer games, assumes both the conceptual transparency of the video or computer screen and the absolute authority of a rational scientific order. In keeping with these cultural prejudices, descriptions of the optical space of video games presume an uncomplicated optical scheme, founded on traditions of linear perspective. This can be seen with game designers, and game critics, treatment of video game perspective and point-of-view: video game spaces are understood to be the procedural outcomes of geometrically articulated orders derived from using program code and the physics of game engines.[2] But, video game spaces are more than simply the sum of their code - they are experiential spaces generated through code and the player{\textquoteright}s interaction with the execution of that code through the medium of the screen. Given this multifaceted experiential component of games, an uncritical conception of spatial phenomenology and the verisimilitude of linear perspective fails to explain how video games operate. Critical theory, theory which explains how the player operates both on the game space and within the game space, is needed. In this paper, I propose that the models of subjectivity and agency offered by psychoanalysis provide a way to investigate the relationship of the player, player-character and the screen. For this investigation, I specifically examine how perspective shapes the field of the gaze and the implications of that shaping.},

question of aesthetic realism in computer games, and try to evaluate its importance in regard to different
elements of playability that generate a sensation of immersion or presence. What we demonstrate, mainly
through the analysis of interviews of Quake players and observations of their activity during lan-parties, is that
players are driven by multi-dimensional pleasures in games, and that realism is far from being enough for
enjoyment. The main qualities in a game{\textquoteright}s universe can be described as "a change of scenery" in different ways:
the senses must be surprised (by sounds as much as images), there must be a cognitive challenge in the discovery
of the laws of the universe (some laws are implicit and require training, like being able to evaluate if one can
jump across a given river), social life must be slightly complex and, if possible, rewarding, emotions can be
unusual, strong, or unusually associated. What the interviews show is that, in the first place, players are usually
attracted to games where the aesthetic aspect is a success. However this aspect is only interesting for a short
time: as soon as performance starts to become a central aspect of gameplay, what turns out to be important is
the game{\textquoteright}s ability to generate emotions on a regular basis, and to be used as a benchmark to evaluate and
compare progress. Depending on the players implication, his/her interest switches from aesthetic realism to the
search for a game adapted, or adaptable, to the task. During Lan-Parties, experienced players parameterised
Quake, not to get the best possible realism but to obtain the maximum speed, precision and clarity. Then the
surroundings have to display a certain form of coherence in driving feelings related to the challenges that are at
stake},

To date, empirical support for this model is based primarily on laboratory-based cognitive methods. This study assessed behavioral inhibition and executive functioning in children with ADHD in 2 real-life contexts: videogames (motor-skill target game, cognitively demanding adventure game) and an outing at the zoo (route tasks). Participants were a community sample of 57 boys diagnosed with ADHD (20 inattentive, 37 combined type) and 57 normally developing control boys, matched individually for age and nonverbal IQ. Operationally defined measures of behavioral inhibition and specific executive functions were derived from these activities and assessed under contrasting conditions of low or high working memory and distractor loads. There were no group differences in basic motor skills on the target game, nor in terms of the ability to inhibit a prepotent or ongoing response in the adventure videogame. However, boys with ADHD exhibited more self-talk, more effortful response preparation, and completed fewer challenges in the latter videogame. Also, they manifested inhibition deficits in terms of interference control during the route task at the zoo and took longer to complete the tasks. Typically, these differences were greatest under conditions of high working memory and distractor loads. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive difficulties in ADHD may be context dependent and that ADHD is associated with deficits in some but not all aspects of behavioral inhibition.},

Violent content has been at the top of the agenda even though aggression and hostility have been identified as a part of competitive gaming situations. The role of the opponent in this process has been largely overlooked. We examined the difference in frustration and aggression in game play after users encountered the computer as opponent and a proximate person as opponent using the same CD-ROM version of Monopoly. We found that users experienced higher levels of aggressive feelings after playing the computer than after playing a stranger face-to-face. It appears that aggression related to computer gaming may be reduced through the humanization of computer opponents.},

There is a range of real-world applications of synthetic social behavior, from short-term possibilities such as autonomous characters for computer games, to long-term applications such as computer interfaces that can interact more appropriately with humans by utilizing human social abilities. Our research offers initial steps toward computational systems with social behavior, in hope of making interactions with them more functional and more inherently rewarding.},

The CRS robot manipulator was adapted for use by children who have disabilities. Our emphasis is on the technical control aspects of the development of an interface and communication environment between the child and the robot arm. The system is designed so that each child has user control and control procedures that are individually adapted. Control interfaces include large push buttons, keyboards, laser pointer, and head-controlled switches. Preliminary results have shown that young children who have severe disabilities can use the robotic arm system to complete functional play-related tasks. Developed software allows the child to accomplish a series of multistep tasks by activating one or more single switches. Through a single switch press the child can replay a series of preprogrammed movements that have a development sequence. Children using this system engaged in three-step sequential activities and were highly responsive to the robotic tasks. This was in marked contrast to other interventions using toys and computer games.},

The Maya-American children are on average 10 centimeters taller, indicating better health. However, nearly half the Maya-American children are overweight and 42 percent are obese. Children who report watching TV or playing computer games as one of their favorite leisure time activities face a higher chance of being overweight. Conclusion. Immigration from Guatemala to the United States improves the health of children in that they generally grow taller.

Punishment levels set by participants for their opponents served as the measure of aggression. The results confirmed our hypothesis that playing the violent game would result in more aggression than would playing the nonviolent game.

	abstract = {This article from the example of videogames for girls to other aspects of designing technology for women, it is instructive to apply McIntosh{\textquoteright}s model to the design of technology. We have left phase one behind: no longer is it possible to build womanless technology. Currently, there is widespread recognition of the importance of taking gender into account in interface design (witness the presence of this chapter in a handbook on HCI). And we have passed through phase two: public perception of the role of women in technology has changed radically, due to the efforts of activist computer scientists and historians who have highlighted, among others, Ada Lovelace{\textquoteright}s seminal role in the birth of the computer, and Grace Hopper{\textquoteright}s essential contribution to computing. Now, however, we find ourselves at a stage where women seem to pose some kind of problem for the design of technology. Tech companies pay consultants to help them figure out how to design for women. One gender and technology consulting firm refers to its ability to help companies succeed at "the notoriously selective and lucrative demographic of teenage girls." A consultant for online businesses advertises its knowledge of "what makes women click": a six-step program from initiating the relationship through subtle tactics of banner and home page design, through deepening the relationship by asking motivating survey questions. The goal is "the inside tract to get inside women{\textquoteright}s minds and keep them inside" the website. In fact, many websites for women have sprung up, but the majority treat the same topics as women{\textquoteright}s magazines that have been around for hundreds of years (the banner on one women{\textquoteright}s website invites readers to learn about "Making your home a haven for your family")},

Male undergraduates (N = 36) were assigned to a high aggressive or low aggressive video-game priming condition. After training, they played Metal Gear Solid(TM), which allows players to advance by using stealth, violence, or both. Participants in the high aggressive priming condition used significantly more violent action during game play and reported more hostility than those in the low aggressive priming condition. Heart rate was correlated with feelings of hostility.

Avatar animation and control is difficult, however, because a large repertoire of avatar behaviors must be made available, and the user must be able to select from this set of behaviors, possibly with a low-dimensional input device. One appealing approach to obtaining a rich set of avatar behaviors is to collect an extended, unlabeled sequence of motion data appropriate to the application. In this paper, we show that such a motion database can be preprocessed for fle xibility in behavior and efficient search and exploited for real-time avatar control. Flexibility is created by identifying plausible transitions between motion segments, and efficient search through the resulting graph structure is obtained through clustering. Three interface techniques are demonstrated for controlling avatar motion using this data structure: the user selects from a set of available choices, sketches a path through an environment, or acts out a desired motion in front of a video camera. We demonstrate the flexibility of the approach through four different applications and compare the avatar motion to directly recorded human motion.},

	abstract = {For individuals with a spinal cord injury or dysfunction (SCI/D), opportunities to exercise are limited and are usually not highly motivating experiences. Exercise programs or extracurricular activities may help increase or maintain the cardiovascular fitness level of individuals with SCI/D. The GAME(Wheels) system, an interface between a portable roller system and a computer, enables an individual to control a video game by propelling his or her wheelchair. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the propulsive forces used during video play, both with and without the GAME(Wheels) system, were different. A secondary purpose was to examine differences in metabolic parameters during exercise under these two conditions. Ten manual wheelchair users exercised on the GAME(Wheels) system with and without controlling a video game. Physiological and kinetic data were collected six times during two exercise trials. Kinetic data were recorded with the SMART(Wheel) and used to investigate propulsion forces. No significant differences were found in the resultant force, rate of rise, or number of hand contacts with the pushrims. This study showed that propulsion pattern did not change significantly when wheelchair users exercised while playing a computer video game. Oxygen consumption, ventilation, and heart rate were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the two groups during the last three exercise intervals and cooldown. Playing a video game while exercising may help to motivate manual wheelchair users to exercise longer and regularly, something that was reported by this study{\textquoteright}s subjects; likewise, exercising while playing a video game may not be associated with higher pushrim forces and stroke frequencies.},

Findings Psychometric analyses show that the PVP seems to be unidimensional and has acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach{\textquoteright}s alpha) at 0.69. The pattern of associations between the scale scores and alternative measures of problem play supports its construct validity (higher total scores in the scale were associated with higher frequency of play, mean and longest times per session, self and parents{\textquoteright} perception of playing to excess, and scores in the Severity of Dependence Scale). Conclusions Our results confirm that the excessive use of video games is associated with a number of problems which resemble a dependence syndrome, and the PVP appears as a useful instrument for the measurement of such problems.},

The release of new games or game-playing equipment, such as the PlayStation 2, generates great excitement and even buying frenzies. Yet, until now, this giant on the popular culture landscape has received little in-depth study or analysis. In this book, Mark J. P. Wolf and four other scholars conduct the first thorough investigation of the video game as an artistic medium. The book begins with an attempt to define what is meant by the term ""video game"" and the variety of modes of production within the medium. It moves on to a brief history of the video game, then applies the tools of film studies to look at the medium in terms of the formal aspects of space, time, narrative, and genre. The book also considers the video game as a cultural entity, object of museum curation, and repository of psychological archetypes. It closes with a list of video game research resources for further study.},

Gun violence can leave lasting emotional scars on these children. This article reviews research regarding the psychological effects of gun violence on children and youth, and offers suggestions for how parents, school administrators, and mental health workers can mitigate these negative effects.* Children exposed to gun violence may experience negative short- and long-term psychological effects, including anger, withdrawal, posttraumatic stress, and desensitization to violence. All of these outcomes can feed into a continuing cycle of violence.* Certain children may be at higher risk for negative outcomes if they are exposed to gun violence. Groups at risk include children injured in gun violence, those who witness violent acts at close proximity, those exposed to high levels of violence in their communities or schools, and those exposed to violent media.* Parents, school administrators, and mental health workers all can play key roles in protecting children from gun violence and helping them overcome the effects of gun-related trauma.The authors recommend a number of strategies that adults can adopt to help children cope with gun violence, such as increasing parental monitoring, targeting services to youth at risk of violent activity, and developing therapeutic interventions to help traumatized young people.Guns are deeply embedded in American society. Indeed, many people around the world perceive the gun as one of America{\textquoteright}s primary cultural icons--from Al Capone{\textquoteright}s machine gun to GI Joe{\textquoteright}s rifle, or more recently, the shotguns and assault rifles of young gang members and adolescent school shooters. An estimated 43\% of American households contain some type of gun. (l) Despite the prevalence of guns in the United States, an ongoing and intense cultural struggle continues regarding their proper place in society, particularly in the lives of children and youth. Most states have laws limiting minors{\textquoteright} access to guns. Yet surveys reveal that many youth, perhaps most, believe they could obtain a gun if they wanted to, and research suggests that as many as one in five inner-city teenagers reports carrying a gun at some point...},

This study examined the relationship between game play and several measures of adjustment or risk taking in a sample of 16-year-old high school students. No evidence was obtained of negative outcomes among game players. On <strong>several measures-including family closeness, activity involvement, positive school engagement, positive mental health, substance use, self-concept, friendship network, and disobedience to parents-game players scored more favorably than did peers who never played computer games</strong>. It is concluded that computer games can be a positive feature of a healthy adolescence.

During the ensuing discussions dominance in the shape of disgust or contempt made up 18 \% of all facial expressions. Different types of smiles, however, were far more frequent - they made up almost half of all facial expressions. Hierarchical regression analyses which were guided by a theoretical model suggest that children showed more often expressions of anger and denigration on their faces when they considered themselves to be rejected by their peers, when their relation ship with their play partner was overshadowed by competition (girls only), and when they experienced intense anger and contempt at the same time. Implications of dominance and denigration for the partner and the cooperation as well as the need of furthering the development of emotional competence are discussed.},

	abstract = {In the 1990s, the videogame industry has managed to become the fastest growing segment of the entertainment industry in America. However, only a very low number of videogame products manage to cover the costs of production and generate earnings. According to traditional marketing wisdom, players{\textquoteright} preferences are a core issue in creating successful products, and the game design process is crucial for guaranteeing players{\textquoteright} satisfaction. Then, an important question arises: What do players want in videogames? The purpose of this work is to propose a game design reference that directly mirrors players{\textquoteright} preference, shaped as a qualitative model based on empirical data gathered during playing sessions. The model describes the main elements that, according to players{\textquoteright} opinions, determine the playability of action videogames; the model proposes design guidelines that are the conceptualization of players{\textquoteright} preferences. Therefore, the model helps game designers to understand the elements that must be dealt with to make better games. Besides the operational relevance of the model, the research methodology described in this work is an example of how a qualitative approach such as the grounded theory paradigm can be applied to solve a software specification problem directly focusing on end-users.},

In a study of school children aged 7 to 9 years old in two schools in Singapore in 1999, a detailed questionnaire was administered to parents regarding reading or close-work habits, past history of close-work, family history, and socioeconomic factors. Cycloplegic refraction was performed five times in each eye. Defining astigmatism as worse than or equal to 0.5, 0.75, and 1 D cylinder in the right eye, the prevalence of astigmatism was calculated. Results. The study population consisted of 1028 children. The prevalence rate of astigmatism (worse than or equal to 1 D cylinder) was 19.2\% (95\% confidence interval, 16.8 to 21.6). This was not different between genders, ethnic groups, or age (p > 0.05). With-the-rule astigmatism was more common than against-the-rule astigmatism. The prevalence of astigmatism and myopia was 9.8\% (95\% confidence interval, 8.0 to 11.6). A high AC/A ratio was associated (p = 0.003) with astigmatism, even after exclusion of myopic children. On vectorial analysis, J(0) and J(45) were associated with the number of hours of playing video games, whereas J(45) was also associated with computer use. Only J(45) was associated to male gender, a high AC/A ratio, and a family history of myopia. Conclusions. The prevalence rate of astigmatism (greater than or equal to1 D) was 19\%. Playing video games and computer use may be associated with astigmatism severity, although the presence of astigmatism (greater than or equal to1 D) was not associated with any nearwork factors. A family history of myopia was associated with oblique astigmatism severity. A high AC/A ratio is associated with astigmatism, and this requires further investigation.},

This paper introduces a new type of search problem by assuming that aims of the target are not known to the searcher. The target may be either a type (iii) cooperator (with a known cooperation probability c) or a type (ii) evader. This formulation models search problems like that for a lost teenager who may be a {\textquoteright}runaway,{\textquoteright} or a lost intelligence agent who may be a defector. In any given search context, it produces a continuum of search problems F(c), 0 less than or equal to c less than or equal to 1, linking a zero-sum search game (with c = 0) to a rendezvous problem (with c = 1). These models thus provide a theoretical bridge between two previously distinct parts of search theory, namely search games and rendezvous search.},

The main conclusion is that the industry is reaching a mature phase with concentration and integration beginning to be found in its stages. A mainstreaming of content is partially countered by a vibrant commnity of developers, mostly for PC games.

	abstract = {Background: Video game seizures have been reported in photosensitive and non-photosensitive patients with epilepsy. The game Super Mario World, has led to many cases of first seizures. We examined whether this game was indeed more provocative than other programs and whether playing the game added to this effect. Methods: We prospectively investigated 352 patients in four European cities, using a standard protocol including testing of a variety of visual stimuli. We correlated historical data on provocative factors in daily life with electroencephalographic laboratory findings. Results: The video game, Super Mario World proved more epileptogenic than standard TV programs and as provocative as programs with flashing lights and patterns. Most striking was the fact that video game- viewing and-playing on the 50 and 100 Hz TV was significantly more provocative than viewing the standard program (P < 0.001, P < 0.05 respectively). Playing the video game Mario World on a 50 Hz TV, appeared to be significantly more provocative than playing this game on the 100 Hz TV (P < 0.001). Of 163 patients with a history of TV-, VG- or CG-seizures, 85\% of them showed epileptiform discharges in response to photic stimulation, 44\% to patterns, 59\% to 50 Hz TV and 29\% to 100 Hz TV. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with a history of video game seizures are, in the vast majority, photosensitive and should be investigated with standardised photic stimulation. Games and programs with bright background or flashing images are specifically provocative. Playing a video game on a 100 Hz TV is less provocative .},

It was predicted that a preference for violent games would be associated with negative externalizing characteristics, in particular aggressive emotions and behaviors, on the Youth Self-Report (YSR), a standardized self- report measure of adolescent problem behaviors. Thirty-two 11- through 15-year-olds (17 girls) listed and categorized favorite electronic games into one of six predetermined categories and completed the YSR. MANOVA revealed significant relationships between a preference for violent games and the Thought Problems subscale (P < .01) and YSR Total Score (P < .05), with trends noted for the Internalizing (P < .06) and Anxious-Depressed (P < .08) subscales. Expected relationships with externalizing behaviors, including aggression, were not found. However, across all YSR subscales, children with higher preference for violent games had more clinically significant elevations than those with low preference for violent games. On the Total Problems subscale, of the eight children receiving scores in the clinically significant range, six were in the High preference group (three boys and three girls). The failure to rind the expected relationships between a preference for violent games and aggressive, externalizing behaviors is puzzling. It is possible that individuals with a preference for violent games may have high exposure to all forms of media violence. Their perceptions of their own behavior, in comparison, may not seem sufficiently aggressive to justify endorsement of problems in this area. Or, playing violent electronic games may promote a disconnection between the emotions normally associated with violence and violent acts. These explanations are consistent with a desensitization model where exposure to media violence decreases sensitivity to aggression. },

Although related research has been done in military simulations, virtual reality systems, and computer supported cooperative working, the suggested solutions diverge from the problems posed by MCGs. With this in mind, this paper provides a concise overview of four aspects affecting networking in MCGs. First, networking resources (bandwidth, latency, and computational power) set the technical boundaries within which the MCG must operate. Second, distribution concepts encompass communication architectures (peer-to-peer, client/server, server-network), and both data and control architectures (centralized, distributed, replicated). Third, scalability allows the MCG to adapt to the resource changes parametrization. Finally, security aims at fighting back against cheating and vandalism, which are common in online gaming.},

Our objective is to present a general framework that allows the automatic control of a camera in a dynamic environment. The proposed method is based on the image-based control or visual servoing approach. It consists of positioning a camera according to the information perceived in the image. This is thus a very intuitive approach of animation. To be able to react automatically to modifications of the environment, we also considered the introduction of constraints into the control. This approach is thus adapted to highly reactive contexts (virtual reality, video games). Numerous examples dealing with classic problems in animation are considered within this framework and presented in this paper.},

These include acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR), language and dialog modeling, and multimodal-multimedia user interface design. First, issues in ASR of children speech are introduced by an analysis of developmental changes in the spectral and temporal characteristics of the speech signal using data obtained from 456 children, ages five to 18 years. Acoustic modeling adaptation and vocal tract normalization algorithms that yielded state-of-the-art ASR performance on children speech are described. Second, an experiment designed to better understand how children interact with machines using spoken language is described. Realistic conversational multimedia interaction data were obtained from 160 children who played a voice-activated computer game in a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) scenario. Results of using these data in developing novel language and dialog models as well as in a unified maximum likelihood framework for acoustic decoding in ASR and semantic classification for spoken language understanding are described. Leveraging the lessons learned from the WoZ study and a concurrent user experience evaluation, a multimedia personal agent prototype for children was designed. Details of the architecture and application details are described. Informal evaluation by children was found positive especially for the animated agent and the speech interface.},

	abstract = {Background: We have previously demonstrated the potential efficacy of a computer-assisted board game as a tool for medical education. The next logical step was to transfer the entire game on to the computer, thus increasing accessibility to students and allowing for a richer and more accurate simulation of patient scenarios. Methods: First, a general game model was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic. A breast module was then created using 3-D models, radiographs, and pathology and cytology images. The game was further improved by the addition of an animated facilitator, who directs the players via gestures and speech. Thirty-three students played the breast module in a variety of team configurations. After playing the game, the students completed surveys regarding its value as both an educational tool and as a form of entertainment. 10-question tests were also administered before and after playing the game, as a preliminary investigation into its impact on student learning, Results: After playing the game, mean test scores increased from 6.43 (SEM +/- 0.30) to 7.14 (SEM +/- 0.30; P = 0.006). The results of the five- question survey were extremely positive. Students generally agreed that the game concept has value in increasing general knowledge regarding the subject matter of breast disease and that the idea of following simultaneously the work-up of numerous patients with similar problems is a helpful way to learn a work-up algorithm. Conclusions: Postgame surveys demonstrate the efficacy of our computer game model as a tool for surgical education. The game is an example of problem based learning because it provides students with an initial set of problems and requires them to collect information and reason on their own in order to solve the problems. Individual game modules can be developed to cover material from different diagnostic areas. },

In Experiment 1, skilled Tetris players outperformed non-Tetris players on mental rotation of shapes that were either identical to or very similar to Tetris shapes, but not on other tests of spatial ability. The pattern of performance on those mental rotation tasks revealed that skilled Tetris Players used the same mental rotation procedures as non-Tetris players, but when Tetris shapes were used, they executed them more quickly. In Experiment 2, non-Tetris players who received 12 hours of Tetris-playing experience did not differ from matched control students in pretest-to-posttest gains on tests of spatial ability. However, Tetris-experienced participants were more likely to use an alternative type of mental rotation for Tetris shapes than were Tetris-inexperienced participants. The results suggest that spatial expertise is highly domain-specific and does not transfer broadly to other domains.},

Two informational interventions ("point-of-decision" prompts to encourage stair use and community-wide campaigns) were effective, as were three behavioral and social interventions (school-based physical education, social support in community settings, and individually-adapted health behavior change) and one environmental and policy intervention (creation of or enhanced access to places for physical activity combined with informational outreach activities). Additional information about applicability, other effects, and barriers to implementation are provided for these interventions. Evidence is insufficient to assess a number of interventions: classroom- based health education focused on information provision, and family-based social support (because of inconsistent findings); mass media campaigns and college-based health education and physical education (because of an insufficient number of studies); and classroom-based health education focused on reducing television viewing and video game playing (because of insufficient evidence of an increase in physical activity). These recommendations should serve the needs of researchers, planners, and other public health decision makers.},

	abstract = {Distributed virtual environment (DVE) systems model and simulate the activities of thousands of entities interacting in a virtual world over a wide area network. Possible applications for DVE systems are multiplayer video games, military and industrial trainings, and collaborative engineering. In general, a DVE system is composed of many servers and each server is responsible to manage multiple clients who want to participate in the virtual world. Each server receives updates from different clients (such as the current position and orientation of each client) and then delivers this information to other clients in the virtual world. The server also needs to perform other tasks, such as object collision detection and synchronization control. A large scale DVE system needs to support many clients and this imposes a heavy requirement on networking resources and computational resources. Therefore, how to meet the growing requirement of bandwidth and computational resources is one of the major challenges in designing a scalable and cost-effective DVE system. In this paper, we propose an efficient partitioning algorithm that addresses the scalability issue of designing a large scale DVE system. The main idea is to dynamically divide the virtual world into different partitions and then efficiently assign these partitions to different servers. This way, each server will process approximately the same amount of workload. Another objective of the partitioning algorithm is to reduce the server-to-server communication overhead. The theoretical foundation of our dynamic partitioning algorithm is based on the linear optimization principle. We also illustrate how one can parallelize the proposed partitioning algorithm so that it can efficiently partition a very large scale DVE system. Lastly, experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning algorithm under various settings of the virtual world.},

Research Methods and Procedures: Nationally representative data from 12,759 participants (6997 non-Hispanic whites, 2676 non-Hispanic blacks, 2185 Hispanics. and 901 Asians) in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995 and 1996). Data on moderate to vigorous and low-intensity physical activity, TV/video viewing, and video game/computer use were obtained from questionnaires. Multivariate models assessed the association of overweight (body mass index greater than or equal to 95th percentile Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics 2000 curves) with initial (and 1-year change) activity and inactivity levels, controlling for age. ethnicity, socioeconomic status, urban residence, cigarette smoking, and region of residence. Results: Overweight prevalence was positively associated with high level TV/video viewing among white boys (odds ratio  = 1.52; 95\% confidence interval ) and girls (OR = 2.45 ). The odds of overweight decreased with high levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity among white boys (OR = 0.81 ), non-Hispanic black boys (OR = 0.86 ) and girls (OR = 0.88 ). and Hispanic boys (OR = 0.90 ) and girls (OR = 0.91 ). Discussion: Predicted probabilities generated from the logistic regression models. which examined the experimental effects of altering hours of TV/video viewing and bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity, show lower overweight among adolescents who watched less TV per week combined with frequent moderate to vigorous physical activity than those who watched more TV per week combined with fewer bouts of weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity. Predicted probabilities suggest important sex and ethnic differences in these associations.},

This study examined differences in stress-induced pressure natriuresis in 69 black and 52 white normotensives age 14 to 27 years, all with a positive family history of hypertension. Urine samples for sodium excretion were collected before and after a series of tasks (video game challenge, forehead cold stimulation). The average blood pressure across the 2 tasks and the average increase in blood pressure to the 2 tasks were calculated. Blacks had higher mean systolic (131 +/- 12 versus 126 +/- 12 min Hg, P < 0.02) and diastolic (77 +/- 8 versus 72 +/- 9 mm Hg, P < 0.001) blood pressure and a greater average change in systolic blood pressure (15 +/- 9 versus 11 +/- 7 mmHg, P < 0.04). This was associated with a smaller change in sodium excretion (2 +/- 6 versus 7 +/- 10 mEq/h P < 0.002). The change in sodium excretion was related to the change in systolic (r = 0.31, P < 0.03) and diastolic (r = 0.27, P < 0.05) blood pressure in whites but not in blacks. Relative wall thickness was greater in blacks (0.31 +/- 0.04 versus 0.29 +/- 0.03, P < 0.002). In conclusion, impaired stress-induced pressure natriuresis in blacks may contribute to racial differences in essential hypertension and its sequelae.},

The industry exhibits six generations: of technological changes in video game consoles and complementary products, with each generation represented by a new set of competitors, dominant designs, and market leaders out-competing the leaders of the prior generation. Our analysis confirms the efficacy of traditional tenets of successful strategic management in a network-based industry, such as the importance of technological innovation, building entry barriers, protecting firm-specific assets, competitive pricing, brand recognition, and effective channel management.

	abstract = {The ability to learn is a potentially compelling and important quality for interactive synthetic characters. To that end, we describe a practical approach to real-time learning for synthetic characters. Our implementation is grounded in the techniques of reinforcement learning and informed by insights from animal training. It simplifies the teaming task for characters by (a) enabling them to take advantage of predictable regularities in their world, (b) allowing them to make maximal use of any supervisory signals, and (c) making them easy to train by humans. We built an autonomous animated dog that can be trained with a technique used to train real dogs called "clicker training". Capabilities demonstrated include being trained to recognize and use acoustic patterns as cues for actions, as well as to synthesize new actions from novel paths through its motion space. A key contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that by addressing the three problems of state, action, and state-action space discovery at the same time, the solution for each becomes easier. Finally, we articulate heuristics and design principles that make learning practical for synthetic characters.},

	abstract = {Recently, the demand for semiconductor devices has been greatest in the consumer market for such products as video games, cellular phones, and DVD players. In order to satisfy these demands, semiconductor manufacturers are now designing new production lines, such as mini fabs, to decrease the processing time for various types of semiconductor devices. Over the past few decades, the availability and throughput of ion implanters have improved dramatically. However, the implantation process itself has, except for a slight change, remained basically the same, A recent article (Ref. 1) describes the basic concept of an ion-implantation process that does not require use of a photoresist mask. This article reports the experimental data and the basic functions of a type of ion implanter currently being developed. This implanter implants ions in one chip at a time through a stencil mask without the use of a photoresist mask. This ion-implantation technology, called stencil mask ion implantation technology, and the ion implanter, called a stencil mask lithographic ion implanter, will be exceptionally suitable for future semiconductor manufacturing processes.},

It is also assumed that entropy may be evaluated from the correlation coefficients obtained for the game event-related activity calculated for the different electroencephalogram derivations in the 10/20 system. The brain mapping derived from these entropy measurements clearly demonstrates the reallocation of speech functions to right brain areas when the classic left language circuits are damaged during prenatal life.},

	abstract = {In this study, we introduce the differential equation model which can explain some hierarchical growth processes. This model is based on the assumptions that some growth processes can be devided into plural stages, and that in a given stage, increasing speed of population (human or otherwise) depends on the size of population in the previous stage. For example, urbanization process can be devided into residential land development stage and building up stage, and the expanding speed of the built-up area depends on the residential development area, In accordance with these assumptions, we formulate the simultaneous differential equations, then calculate their general solutions. We consider that this model can describe the sales of the video game machines, because the process of buying them has following two stages, first a person wants to buy the machine, then he actually buys it, In addition, the person who gets the game machine will buy some video game softwares. Deriving new model with these thought, we can confirm that the model can explain the sales of video game machines well especially shortly after the machine{\textquoteright}s being put on the market. This consequence indicates that the hierarchical model is appropriate for the explanation of the growth tendency of the beginning period. Furthermore, the application of this model to explain the sudden growth in a growth process is proposed in this paper. When a price reduce campaign is launched, the sales of the machines shows a tendency of sudden increase. The model can explain this change by adding only two parameters to the original model. Our model has so simple structure that it will be able to represent some underlying mechanisms of various growth processes.},

This target is only slightly short of being reached, as was demonstrated when Columbia Pictures released Final Fantasy in 2001, an animated science fiction film with high-definition emotive characters. Through what has been a cultural and technological convergence, we are now starting to see software tools and techniques that can generate life-like characters while not sacrificing the human judgement and artistic skills that are needed in character animation. Computer games, films, and the Internet are now starting to use virtual humans, which as our conclusion will show will become more realistic. However, a new challenge has been set - people now do not want to just play a computer game with a visually realistic character, or see a television programme with a vivid computer generated character - they want to see themselves in that computer game or film. The future is towards individuals having their own virtual clones, which they can utilise in computer-generated worlds and applications. This paper will discuss the advantages of having a personal computer-generated character, and also describe several systems that BTexact Technologies have successfully developed and deployed to generate them, as well as some of the applications for which they can be used. The paper will finish by glimpsing into the future of what we can expect to see in the next few years, with the advent of this new exciting technology.},

Brands demonstrated recall superiority when they were a major part of game-play or when they were local or new brands, atypical of brands found in games, or relevant to the consumer. When asked their attitudes toward product placements, players were generally positive, indicating that they did not consider the practice deceptive and that brands can enhance game-realism. Open-ended comments revealed that players{\textquoteright} attitudes, however, depended upon the game genre and how and where the brand appeared.},

On the other hand, the mechanization of subjectivity carried the danger of simply reducing the human to the machine. The author argues that predominant artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to modeling agents are based on an erasure of subjectivity analogous to that which appears when people are subjected to institutionalization. The result is agent behavior that is fragmented, depersonalized, lifeless and incomprehensible. Approaching the problem using a hybrid of critical theory and AI agent technology, the author argues that agent behavior should be narratively understandable; she presents a new agent architecture that structures behavior to be comprehensible as narrative.},

The data are converted into structures targeted directly to the hardware, and a code stream is assembled that describes the manipulations required to render these data structures. Our compiler is structured like a traditional code compiler, with a front end that reads the geometric data and attributes (hereafter referred to as an art asset) output from a 3D modeling package and shaders in a platform independent form and performs platform-independent optimizations, and a back end that performs platform-specific optimizations and generates platform-targeted data structures and code streams. Our compiler back-end has been targeted to four platforms, three of which are radically different from one another. On all platforms the rendering performance of our compiled assets, used in real situations, is well above that of hand-coded assets.},

While most of existing e-commerce applications can be modified to run in a wireless environment, m-commerce also involves many more new applications that become possible only due to the wireless infrastructure. These applications include mobile financial services, user and location specific mobile advertising, mobile inventory management, wireless business re-engineering, and mobile interactive games. In addition to device and wireless constraints, mobile commerce would also be impacted by the dependability of wireless infrastructure. Unlike e-commerce applications that usually run on fixed networking infrastructure of fairly high dependability (approaching to about 100\%), m-commerce applications may not receive such high dependability from the existing and emerging wireless infrastructure. So far, most of the m-commerce research focuses on applications, devices, and security issues. We believe that some work is necessary in addressing the dependability challenges of the wireless infrastructure. In this paper, we present (a) the dependability issues of wireless infrastructure, (b) several architectures to improve the dependability of wireless networks, and (c) a simulation model and results on wireless dependability for m-commerce. The results show that a significant improvement is possible in wireless dependability for supporting m-commerce applications.},

From these expressions (which are highly consequential), the player has to anticipate the hosts{\textquoteright} reactions to the avatar (which may vary from friendly to obstructing or aggressive) and choose between negotiating with a host (by altering the avatar{\textquoteright}s facial expression), attacking it, or searching for an escape route.

This is particularly true for systems utilizing graphical, icon or window-based input and output. Multimedia technology also facilitates "reuse" more naturally, since the basic components and functions of presentation and animation can be reused for several different animation scenarios. This is evidenced by the rapid prototyping capability of computer and video games where although the characters and story lines change, the basic animation remains constant. In this paper we utilize multimedia technology for eliciting requirements of software systems, particularly those systems that utilize windows- (or graphical)-based interactions with the user. Our methodology will implicitly emphasize reuse since in our approach reusable components include not only code and documents, but also voice narration, animation sequences and message mechanisms. We call such software components as multimedia reusable components (MRCs). Using MRCs. one can view software requirements instead of reading textual representation of the requirements. },

Wireless online games is one of the rising stars in the market. Nevertheless, the insecurity of data transmission through wireless networks and the low performance of the central processing unit (CPU) of mobile devices create a harrier to doing business through these wireless networks. This paper proposes an "interactive dynamic cryptosystem" for enhancing the security of data transmission through wireless networks and a multi-tier architecture for improving the performance and management of the multiuser wireless online games system. Based on the proposal, a safe environment can be set up for truly real-time interactive wireless online games.},

Differences between a disciplinary and trans-disciplinary review are explored from the viewpoint of knowledge development in the social field of power. In that respect, designers and facilitators of games and simulations have to cope with putting their institutions at risk, as the form of knowledge generated through gaming and simulation i.e., their social capital, may not count as recognizable currency. The articles give ample evidence of the related obstacles in research, teaching, and practice. Nevertheless, the articles show what has been accomplished and which major puzzles gamers still need to address to improve professional practice in research and education, in management and governance.

	abstract = {A shift in military training is underway from a traditional emphasis on classroom instruction to a more learner-centric model of training. In this approach, where training may be delivered "anytime, anywhere," trainees are often dispersed, and there is a greater responsibility on the learner to maintain motivation for his or her own learning. Although instructional games can provide a learning environment that actively engages the learner, this remains a relatively new instructional technology with limited empirical support. 

Several studies have examined the effects of game-based instructional programs on learning. For example, both Whitehall and McDonald (1993) and Ricci, Salas, and Cannon-Bowers (1996) found that instruction incorporating game features led to improved learning. In addition, Ricci, et. al (1996) proposed that instruction that incorporated game features enhanced student motivation, which led to greater attention to training content and greater retention. 

There is an implicit model of learning that is inherent in these studies. First, the goal is to design an instructional program that incorporates certain features or characteristics of games. Second, these features trigger a game cycle, a repeating cycle of user judgments, behavior, and feedback that characterizes the game player{\textquoteright}s self-motivated engagement and task persistence (Garris, Ahlers, and Driskell, 2001). To the extent that training designers are successful in pairing instructional content with appropriate game features, this engagement in game play leads to the achievement of training objectives and specific learning outcomes. 

Although many have noted the potential benefits that may be gained from incorporating game characteristics into instructional applications, there is clearly little consensus regarding what the essential characteristics are and how they should be implemented. Based on a review of the literature about games, motivational training, and motivation-related constructs, we synthesized a model of motivational training using game features and predicted training and motivation outcomes. In this paper, we describe essential game features, how they were implemented for this research, and report a subset of the results of an empirical study to assess the effectiveness of a game-based trainer to enhance submarine technical skills and the effects of the training approach on student motivation. Bottom Gun, a game-based periscope trainer developed in support of this research, is a simulation-based game that incorporates simulated contacts, a high rate of interactivity, scoring, and visual and sound effects. The control training condition provided the same contacts within the same scenarios minus the game characteristics. 

The proposed approach to designing and evaluating the effectiveness of games was generally supported. Despite holding training objectives and content constant, Bottom Gun was perceived as more game-like than the control condition. Results indicated that both training conditions resulted in significant improvements in accuracy in calling angle-on-the-bow, a difficult visual perception task. However, the game-based training resulted in smaller visual estimation errors than the control training condition. Additionally, four context-specific measures of components of motivation, including locus of control, self-efficacy, valence, and goal commitment were found to have shifted in a positive direction at the post-test.

Subjects were 385 normotensive youth  (mean age 12.7 +/- 2.6 at baseline year) with a positive family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). During the baseline evaluation subjects were presented with four laboratory stressors (namely, postural change, video game challenge, social competence interview, and parent-child conflict discussion). The BP and HR values taken during each of the laboratory stressors and during the post stressor recovery periods were converted to z-scores which were averaged to yield aggregate measures for systolic and diastolic BP and HR responsivity and recovery. The data obtained during the baseline evaluation were subsequently used to predict the follow-up values of supine resting BP and HR. The prediction models were fairly consistent across each of the 4 follow-up years. Responsivity or recovery accounted for up to 6\% of the total variance after accounting for baseline values. Within the prediction models responsivity or recovery accounted for 4-56\% of the variance. The predictive value of the derived models did not decline from one annual evaluation to the next over the length of the study. CV recovery may supplement resting and responsivity in the prediction of future development of CVD.},

Thirty children 10-14 years old who played video games in their leisure time participated in this controlled study. The sample included children with Learning Disabilities and ADHD. Measures of auditory memory, attention, and planning, as well as beta and theta activity in the brain, were collected as pre- and posttest measures. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. Participants in the experimental group played video games for 1 h, while participants in the control group played card or board games for 1 h. Pre- and post-test difference scores were analyzed according to group for variations between groups. No significant differences were noted on MANOVAs. When children in this sample engaged in video game play with mildly rated (E for Everyone) recreational video games without blood, gore, and carnage for a limited time (60 min), beta and theta activity and ability to perform certain neuropsychological tasks did not appear to be disrupted.

Their results highlight the efficiency of AI methods that are now quite standard. Such methods are very useful to Go programs, but they do not enable a strong Go program to be built. The problems related to Computer Go require new AI problem solving methods. Given the great number of problems and the diversity of possible solutions, Computer Go is an attractive research domain for AI. Prospective methods of programming the game of Go will probably be of interest in other domains as well. The goal of this paper is to present Computer Go by showing the links between existing studies on Computer Go and different AI related domains: evaluation function, heuristic search, machine learning, automatic knowledge generation, mathematical morphology and cognitive science. In addition, this paper describes both the practical aspects of Go programming, such as program optimization, and various theoretical aspects such as combinatorial game theory, mathematical morphology, and Monte-Carlo methods.},

The main goal of this paper is to show the applicability of framework-based reuse to videogames. Both standard and framework-based game implementations are compared and the results are analysed. Special attention is paid to the (potential) benefits that the use of frameworks brings to the fulfillment of maintenance tasks along the game{\textquoteright}s life cycle, a stage that normally consumes most resources in software projects.

We then describe the research issues and Al techniques that are relevant to each of these roles. Our conclusion is that interactive computer games provide a rich environment for incremental research on human-level AI.},

Now, however, the mode of simulation is sued as an effective pedagogical tool that privileges active experimentation with its subject material rather than observation. Simulation is also a way to explore the partly unknown, to test models and hypotheses, and thus to construct and acquire new knowledge in a way narrative never could. The article at hand defends the claim that spatiality is a central theme in computer games. It starts by expanding this claim: Spatiality is the defining element in computer games. They are essentially concerned with spatial representation and negotiation, and therefore a classification of computer games can be based on how they represent space.},

We report the results of the first year 24 h personal magnetic field monitoring for 356 US and Canadian children by time weighted average TWA and alternative exposure metrics. The mean TWA of 0.12 muT was similar to earlier personal exposure studies involving children. A high correlation was found between 24 h TVA and alternative metrics: 12 h day TWA, 12 night TWA, geometric mean, 95th percentile value, percentage time over 0.2 and 0.3 muT, and an estimate of field stability (Constant Field Metric). Two measures of field intermittency, rate of chance metric (RCM) and standardized rate of change metric (RCMS), were not highly correlated with TWA. The strongest predictor of TWA was location of residence, with highest TWAs associated with urban areas. Residence in an apartment, lower paternal educational level, and residential mobility were also associated with higher TWAs. There were no significant differences in the appliance use patterns of children with higher TWA values. Children with the highest field intermittency (high RCM) were more likely to sit within 3 feet of a video game attached to the TV. Our results suggest that 24 h TWA is a representative metric for certain patterns of exposure, but is not highly correlated with two metrics that estimate field intermittency.},

	abstract = {Approaches to computer game playing based on alpha-beta search of the tree of possible move sequences combined with a position evaluation function have been successful for many games, notably Chess. Such approaches are less successful for games with large search spaces and complex positions, such as Go, and we are led to seek alternatives. One such alternative is to model the goals of the players, and their strategies for achieving these goals. This approach means searching the space of possible goal expansions, typically much smaller than the space of move sequences. Previous attempts to apply these techniques to Go have been unable to provide results for anything other than a high strategic level or very open game positions. In this paper we describe how adversarial hierarchical task network planning can provide a framework for goal-directed game playing in Go which is also applicable both strategic and tactical problems.},

This led us to investigate the biological behavior, cell dynamics, and nobreak tumorigenesis of SEGAs. All patients (4 men and 3 women; age range, 6-27 years; mean, 13.6 years) had features of tuberous sclerosis complex and obstructive hydrocephalus. One patient had intratumoral bleeding. In two patients, sequential neuroimaging showed a subependymal nodule growing to become a SEGA. All underwent surgical resection without radiation therapy. One tumor recurred and was treated surgically. There were no postoperative deaths. The presence of cytologic atypia, mitoses and vascular proliferation had no implication in terms of the clinical course. MIB-1 labeling indices were low (mean, 0.9), indicating low proliferative potential. Unexpectedly, bcl-2 staining was sparse and bax staining predominated in majority of cases. However, the mean value of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling index was low. Immunohistochemically, tumors were positive for both glial and neuronal markers. In the majority of our cases, the expression of p53 was low. Only one tumor was focally positive for tuberin. SEGAs have low proliferative potential and apoptotic activity, and exhibit features of mixed glial- neuronal differentiation. In contrast to p53, tuberin is suggested to be the tumor suppressor in this tumor.},

For those trials with the Distractor, a segment of the television show "The Simpsons" was simultaneously played on a television screen adjacent to the computer game monitor and at an equal volume. Contrary to theory and expectations an analysis of the data did not reveal any statistically significant differences in the frequency, type and severity of body movements between the ADHD and non-ADHD boys, or between the ADHD subtypes during computer video game play.

Design. Survey of residency curricula, consisting of 17 items about children{\textquoteright}s exposure to media, including television, movies, popular music, computer/video games and the Internet, the effects of this exposure on specific health risks, and associations between program characteristics and media education in the residency curriculum. Participants. Directors of the 209 accredited pediatric residency programs in the United States. Results. Two hundred four programs (97.6\%) responded. Fifty-eight programs (28.4\%) offered formal education on 1 or more types of media; 60 programs (29.4\%) discussed the influences of media when teaching about specific health conditions. Residents in 96 programs (47.1\%) were encouraged to discuss media use with patients and parents; 13 programs (6.4\%) taught media literacy as an intervention. Among program characteristics, only media training received by program directors was significantly associated with inclusion of media in residency curricula. Conclusions. Despite increasing awareness of media influence on child health, less than one-third of US pediatric residency programs teach about media exposure. Developing a pediatric media curriculum and training pediatric residency directors or designated faculty may be a resource-effective means of improving health for children growing up in a media-saturated environment.},

Using a sample of year 3 and 5 pupils in three primary schools, qualitative and quantitative data were gathered. The results suggest that children make more use of the computer at home than at school. The most popular activity on the home computer which all children enjoyed was playing games. The most frequent activity at the school computer was word processing which pupils considered boring. Interesting gender differences showed that boys spent more lime playing computer games whereas girls spent more time on the Internet emailing friends. The study concludes that schools should learn from what works at home and enable children to work on activities they find valuable, motivational and worthwhile.},

Although these interdisciplinary intentions are widely agreed upon, students often feel less motivated to actually materialize this integration as they mostly find one set of lectures dealing more or less exclusively with technical aspects, and another set dealing predominantly with the perspectives from, e.g., psychology or educational science. While the advantage of learning {\textquotedblleft}across the boundaries{\textquotedblright} of Snow{\textquoteright}s Two Cultures is quite accepted, the motivation for doing so often wanes in the face of the effort.

To determine the patterns of computer usage among adolescents in Hong Kong and to examine whether computer usage is associated with less physical activity and social support among adolescents. Methods: A total of 2110 secondary school students (52\% boys and 48\% girls) in Hong Kong completed a set of questionnaires to measure their computer usage and lifestyle. Mean age of the respondents was 14.16 years (SD = 1.81 years). Computer usage was taped by asking the students to indicate how much time (in minutes) they spent on the computer each day for doing homework assignments; playing computer games; "surfing" the Internet; and communicating with others. The students also provided information on their social-physical lifestyle. Student{\textquoteright}s t-tests and analysis of variance were used to examine group differences. Pearson product moment correlations were used to explore relationships between computer usage and lifestyle. Results: Boys who use computers for doing homework, "surfing" the Internet, and communicating with others engage in more social-physical activities than others. Boys who use computers to play games tend to be more social-behaviorally inactive. For girls, patterns of computer usage are not related to lifestyle. Conclusions: Computer users tended to engage in social-physical activities more frequently and had higher social support than nonusers. But among computer users, the amount of time spent daily on the computer was not associated with lifestyle. Instead, patterns of computer usage are more related to lifestyle and the relationship is moderated by gender.},

	abstract = {Predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence is one of the most important current problems of modern biology. The GASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) blind prediction experiments aim to assess the prediction capabilities in the field. A limitation of GASP is that predictions are prepared and filed by humans using programs, and thus, what is being evaluated is the performance of the predicting groups rather than the performance of the programs themselves. To address this limitation the Critical Assessment of Fully Automated Structure Prediction (CAFASP) experiment was initiated in 1998. In CAFASP, the participants are programs or Internet servers, and what is evaluated are their automatic results without allowing any human intervention. In this paper, we review in brief the current state of protein structure prediction and describe what has been learned from the CAFASP1 experiment, the evolution toward CAFASP2, and how we foresee the future of automated structure prediction. We observe that the histories of "in silico" structure prediction experiments and computer chess tournaments show some striking similarities as well as some differences. We question whether the major advances in automated protein structure prediction stem from novel insights of the protein folding problem, of protein evolution and function, or merely from the technical advances in the ways the evolutionary information available in the biological databases is exploited We conclude with a speculation about the future, where interesting chess might only be observed in computer games and where the interpretation of the information encoded in the human genome may be achieved mainly through in silico biology.},

The performance benefits of contextual interference have been demonstrated frequently. This study examines the influence of a participant characteristic (trait cognitive anxiety) on the learning of multiple related skills in a contextual interference paradigm. Contextual interference effects were tested by controlling for individual differences in trait cognitive anxiety when learning sport-oriented computer games. Undergraduate sport management majors ((N) under bar =20) completed the Sport Anxiety Scale (Smith et al, 1990). Then they played a computer game simulating the events of the winter Olympics. Participants were randomly assigned to either a random or blocked practice schedule, practicing 72 training trials of three events in two testing sessions. Delayed retention and transfer tests were performed after a four-day interval. The dependent variable was time taken to complete an event. An ANCOVA model, using trait cognitive anxiety as a covariate, showed participants in random ((M) under bar (adjusted)=247sec) were significantly faster ((p) under bar <0.05) than participants in blocked practice schedules (<(M)under bar>(adjusted)=281sec) during transfer. However, during acquisition and retention, random and blocked participants performed similarly. Results extend previous contextual interference findings and are discussed in terms of the implications of these findings on contextual interference and cognitive anxiety in an interdisciplinary framework.},

Third- and fourth-grade children (mean age, 8.9 years) in two socio-demographically and scholastically matched public elementary schools were eligible to participate. Children in one randomly selected elementary school received an 18-lesson, 6-month classroom curriculum to reduce television, videotape, and video game use. In both schools, in September (before intervention) and April (after intervention) of a single school year, children and parents reported children{\textquoteright}s prior week{\textquoteright}s purchase requests for toys seen on television. After intervention, children in the intervention school were significantly less likely to report toy purchase requests than children in the control school, with adjusting for baseline purchase requests, gender, and age (odds ratio, 0.29; 95\% confidence interval, 0.12-0.69). Among intervention school children, reductions in self-reported purchase requests were also associated with reductions in television viewing. There was no significant difference between schools in parent reports of children{\textquoteright}s requests for toy purchases. These findings suggest that reducing television viewing is a promising approach to reducing the influences of advertising on children{\textquoteright}s behavior.},

A total of 71 children aged 8 to 12 years played a paper-and-pencil game, a nonviolent video game, and a violent video game. Results indicate that arousal, as measured by heart rate and self-reported arousal, increased significantly after playing the violent video game, as compared with the other two game conditions, with girls reporting more arousal than did boys. There was no significant increase in aggressive mood scores for either boys or girls after playing the violent game. Positive mood, as measured by positive affect, showed no significant increases or decreases after playing either video game. However, positive mood, as measured by general mood, showed a significant increase after playing the violent game for both boys and girls, but only as compared with the paper-and-pencil game. Results are interpreted in terms of social learning and cognitive information processing theories of aggression.},

	abstract = {Even if golf video games provide no proprioceptive afferences on actual putting movement, they may give sufficient substitutive visual cues to enhance force control in this skill. It was hypothesized that this usefulness requires, however, two conditions: the video game must provide reliable demonstrations of actual putts, and the user must want to use the game to make progress in actual putting. Accordingly, a video game was selected on the basis of its fidelity to the real-world game. It allowed two different methods of adjusting the virtual player{\textquoteright}s putting force in order to hole a putt: an analogue method that consisted of focusing on the virtual player{\textquoteright}s movement and a symbolic method that consisted of focusing on the movement of a gauge on a scale representing the virtual player{\textquoteright}s putting force. The participants had to use one of these methods with either the intention of making progress in actual putting or in a second condition to simply enjoy the game. Results showed a positive transfer of video playing to actual putting skill for the learning group and also, to a lesser degree, for the enjoyment group; but only when they used the symbolic method. Results are discussed in the context of how vision may convey force cues in sports video games.},

Material and methods: One thousand eight hundred seventy-six children aged 7-12 years took part in this study at school. All 16 schools of the same school district were randomized into two groups: games group and control group, both receiving conventional nutritional teaching by their teachers. The children in the games group played computer games during the conventional nutritional teaching period (2 hours a week for 5 weeks). At completion of the study, dietetic knowledge and dietary records were evaluated in both groups. Results: Dietary knowledge tests results were better in the games group (p < 0.001). The children in the games group had a significantly better balanced diet for an energy intake of about 1900 kilocalories: more carbohydrate (46.4 +/- 0.2\% vs 45.7 +/- 0.2\%, p < 0.05), less fat(37.1 +/- 0.1\% vs 37.6 +/- 0.2\%, p < 0.05), less protein (16.5 +/- 0.1\% vs 16.7 +/- 0.1\%, p < 0.05), less saccharose (11.5 +/- 0.1\% vs 12.2 +/- 0.2\%, p < 0.001), more calcium (p < 0.001) and more fiber (p < 0.05). The games group had a better snack at 10 a.m., a less copious lunch and less nibbling (p < 0.001), Conclusion: The children in the games group had slightly but significantly better nutritional knowledge and dietary intake compared to children in the control group.

Hemodynamics were measured at rest and during four stressors (ie, postural change, car driving simulation, video game, forehead cold). Echocardiographic-derived measures of LVM were indexed separately to body surface area and height(2,7). Controlling for age and race differences (ie, 74\% of African Americans v, 47\% of whites had positive FH), the positive FH group exhibited greater LVM/height(2,7), LVM/body surface area, higher systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) and lower cardiac index at rest (P < .05 for all). The positive FH group also displayed higher peak SEP or DBP and higher TPRI increases to each stressor and came from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds (P < .05 for all). Regression analyses indicated that FH of EH was not a significant determinant of LVM/height(2,7) after accounting for contributions of gender (greater in men), general adiposity, resting cardiac index and blood pressure (BP), and TPRI responsivity to video game and cold stimulation (P < .05 for all). Thus, greater LVM index; in positive FH of EH youth appears in part related to their greater BP and TPRI at rest and during stress. },

Methods.-We conducted a self-report survey among 1197 sixth and seventh graders in 10 middle schools in 4 Boston-area communities in 1995. To assess independent associations, SUDAAN linear regressions were calculated to control for respondent characteristics and household access and to account for clustered sampling in the school-based design. Results.-Total viewing (television, videos, movies, and computer and video games) averaged 3.35 +/- 2.2 hours per day. In multivariate regressions, independent direct associations with total viewing were observed for the following categories: youth has a television in the bedroom: 0.64 hours per day (P < .001), never/seldom has family dinners: 0.55 hours (P < .01), no parental limits on television time: 0.48 hours (P < .01): and each additional television outside the youth{\textquoteright}s bedroom, 0.12 hours (P < .05). Similar results held when television/video/niovie use was examined separately from computer/video game use. Youth reported an average of 1.6 +/- 1.1 hours of reading and homework per day, Parental limits on television time were associated with 0.21 hours more reading per day (P < .01), whereas a television in the bedroom was associated with 0.18 hours less (P < .01). Conclusions.- Reducing intrahousehold television access may enhance clinical, school, and Community strategies to reduce youth television viewing and other screen time.},

To address this issue, we examined common sedentary diversional activities engaged in by children. We decided to use video games to facilitate the intrinsic motivation of play. The monitor of a video game activity was inverted and placed behind the head of the bed so that the child could maintain proper neck positioning. We found the activity to be beneficial in many aspects.

We conducted series of human subject experiments that incorporated different combinations of media, including the comparative study of the different performances of 60 human users, aiming to answer the question: What are the effects of force feedback (and associated time delays) when used in combination with visual and auditory information as part of a multi-modal interface?

Performance on the tests was related to sex, age, education level, family income and race-ethnicity. Performance decreased as age increased, and increased as education level and family income increased. Differences in performance between sexes, levels of education and racial-ethnic groups tended to decrease as family income increased. The relationship between age and performance on the symbol-digit substitution test varied by education level and by racial-ethnic group. The relationship between age and performance on the serial digit learning test varied by racial-ethnic group. Questionnaire variables that were related to performance on one or more of the tests included the reported amount of last night{\textquoteright}s sleep, energy level, computer or video game familiarity, alcoholic beverages within the last 3 h and effort. Persons who took the tests in English or Spanish performed differently on the symbol-digit substitution and serial digit learning tests.

A case study connects two aspects of this process. The first is the binding of minds and imaginations in the information spaces dominated by media corporations, using the example of Nintendo, a leading company in the video game business. The second facet of the contemporary enclosures is the incarceration of laboring bodies of dispossessed peasants and subsistence providers in the factory-spaces of the new planetary industrial zones. The specific case involves an assembly plant operated by a Nintendo subcontractor, Maxi-Switch, in the Mexican maquiladoras, where the destruction of a pre-capitalist peasant agriculture has created a labor force available for re-enclosure and multinational exploitation in the "postmodern Satanic Mills" of globalized capital.},

MEASUREMENTS: Objective measurements were collected of PA over a 7-day period using the CSA 7164 accelerometer: total daily counts; daily moderate (3- 5.9 METs) physical activity (MPA); daily vigorous physical activity (greater than or equal to 6 METs; VPA); and weekly number of 5, 10 and 20 min bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (greater than or equal to 3 METs, MVPA). Self-report measures were collected of PA self-efficacy; social influences regarding PA, beliefs about PA outcomes; perceived PA levels of parents and peers, access to sporting and/or fitness equipment at home, involvement in community-based PA organizations; participation in community sports teams; and hours spent watching television or playing video games. RESULTS: Compared to their non-obese counterparts, obese children exhibited significantly lower daily accumulations of total counts, MPA and VPA as well as significantly fewer 5, 10 and 20 min bouts of MVPA. Obese children reported significantly lower levels of PA self-efficacy, were involved in significantly fewer community organizations promoting PA and were significantly less likely to report their father or male guardian as physically active. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that physical inactivity is an important contributing factor in the maintenance of childhood obesity. Interventions to promote PA in obese children should endeavor to boost self-efficacy perceptions regarding exercise, increase awareness of, and access to, community PA outlets, and increase parental modeling of PA.},

Examples of this kind of media are shared whiteboard presentations and networked computer games. One key problem of this media class is that a large amount of common functionality is currently redesigned and redeveloped for each single medium. In order to solve this problem we present a media model and an application level protocol called RTP/I. Derived from the experience gained with audio and video transmission using RTP, RTP/I is defined as a new protocol framework which reuses many aspects of RTP while it is thoroughly adapted to meet the demands of distributed interactive media. By identifying and supporting the common aspects of distributed interactive media RTP/I allows the reuse of key functionality in form of generic services. Furthermore RTP/I makes it possible for applications of different vendors to interact with each other in a standardized way.},

We earlier showed these neurons to code the schema of the hand which can be altered in accordance with psychological modification of the body image: that is, when the monkey used a rake as a tool to extend its reach, the visual RFs of these neurons elongated along the axis of the tool, as if the monkeys self image extended to the end of the tool. In the present experiment, we trained monkeys to recognize their image in a video monitor (despite the earlier general belief that monkeys are not capable of doing so), and demonstrated that the visual RF of these bimodal neurons was now projected onto the video screen so as to code the image of the hand as an extension of the self. Further, the coding of the imaged hand could intentionally be altered to match the image artificially modified in the monitor.},

The content of this activity was strongly biased toward more playful interests than the curricula agenda of the institution. This did not reflect unfavorable competition between the activity of study and other discrete activities such as computer games. Instead, the capacity of the desktop environment to provide strong distracting affordances for interaction and interruption is noted. This sustains a significantly mobile and multitasking style of engagement. We noted that the versatility of ubiquitous computing creates tensions in relation to the activity system of private study. The same characteristics that empower research-led study practices also empower the pursuit of interests in distracting competition with the demands of learning and research.

Finally, we discuss the use of clinical intervention, education, and filtering software as strategies for managing the possible violent effects of video games. The inconsistencies in the findings from a vast body of research and the rate of advancement in video game technology make it difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the relationship between exposure to video game violence and aggressive behaviour. However, it is concluded that there is preliminary evidence that violent video games may have an antisocial effect on young players. It is therefore recommended that Australian policy makers actively intervene at an educational level.},

This analysis focuses on simulation as a representational form, which unlike others such as narrative, creates models that not only display the characteristics of the source system, but also reproduce its behavior by means of a set of rules. Therefore, videogames have the potential to represent reality not as a collection of images or texts, but as a dynamic system that can evolve and change. After studying how the process of interpretation functions in simulations, I propose to adapt the basic elements of the work of drama theorist Augusto Boal into videogame design. Boal created a set of techniques for participative theater that raises the spectators{\textquoteright} awareness about their reality and encourages personal and social change. I propose two examples of how these goals could be attained by using videogames. One is based on a popular videogame that simulates suburban life. By modifying its design, I suggest ways for players to deconstruct the simulation{\textquoteright}s ideological assumptions and discuss alternative constructions that reflect their personal opinions. The second, uses videogame design in order to allow players to present their personal problems as unresolved simulations that will be shared and discussed among peers.},

Researchers in areas such as cognitive science, philosophy, and artificial intelligence have proposed a variety of models of emotions. Most of the previous models focus on an agent{\textquoteright}s reactive behavior, for which they often generate emotions according to static rules or pre-determined domain knowledge. However, throughout the history of research on emotions, memory and experience have been emphasized to have a major influence on the emotional process. In this paper, we propose a new computational model of emotions that can be incorporated into intelligent agents and other complex, interactive programs. The model uses a fuzzy-logic representation to map events and observations to emotional states. The model also includes several inductive learning algorithms for learning patterns of events, associations among objects, and expectations. We demonstrate empirically through a computer simulation of a pet that the adaptive components of the model are crucial to users{\textquoteright} assessments of the believability of the agent{\textquoteright}s interactions.

The research evidence that children have become less active to the point where it is seriously damaging their current and future health has been difficult to establish. This situation is due to difficulties in establishing sensitive health risk markers, and also with the assessment of the different elements of physical activity which in children and adolescents is a complex profile of social behaviours. Self report of activity is unreliable with young children, and objective measures are required that are cheap and effective with large samples and that are capable of measuring levels, volume and patterns of physical activity. Accelerometry in combination with diaries offers the best current solution for most activity-health relationships, and for informing intervention need and design.},

	abstract = {Demographic trends in the United States suggest that the general public will become increasingly isolated from traditional consumptive uses of wildlife. This is correlated with nationwide decreases in hunter initiation and continuation. Because most state wildlife agencies derive a large portion of their funding from hunting-license sales, a decline in this source of revenue could have dramatic implications for future wildlife management programming. The International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (IAFWA) developed the Hunting as a Choice (HAC) project to help its member state fish and wildlife agencies effectively address these trends. HAC products target nontraditional constituents (suburban 10-12-year-old children). As a marketing study, we assessed the effectiveness of HAC to determine whether computer-based educational products (website and computer game) could increase the interest of 10- to 12-year-old suburban children in hunting or hunter education classes. Nearly half of the 91 suburban school children in Jacksonville, Florida, exposed to the website and computer game requested more information about taking a hunter education course from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Participants also became more tolerant of other people who hunt.},

In Study 2, laboratory exposure to a graphically violent video game increased aggressive thoughts and behavior. In both studies, men had a more hostile view of the world than did women. The results from both studies are consistent with the General Affective Aggression Model, which predicts that exposure to violent video games will increase aggressive behavior in both the shea term (e.g., laboratory aggression) and the long term (e.g., delinquency).},

In this paper, we analyze and design control system of soccer robot in the frame of visual servoing. We think that our approach encourages more systematic approaches to soccer robot system. MIROSOT system is a typical direct visual servo system with a fixed camera and mobile robots with internal sensors such as encoders. In real games, encoders often offer wrong position data due to slips and collisions between robots or between a robot and a walt However, vision provides positions and orientations of robots in certain accuracy regardless of slips or collisions. In spite of this advantage inevitable time-delay arising from vision and communication subsystems seriously causes undesired effects in control of robots. In this paper we present a visual servo controller considering the time-delay. First, we present an accurate dynamic model of organic cooperation of robot soccer systems [3] that includes the time-delay. And we design the Smith predictor [13] using the model to cancel out the deteriorating effect of time-delay in our soccer robot system And using the model, we also propose control structure with primary/secondary controller [12] to control the system precisely. Finally, we show performance of the proposed controller and the predictor in simulation studies.},

"The title of this paper is the grand "what computer games can and can{\textquoteright}t do". While I am unfortunately unable to give you a full answer to the question in my title, it is meant more literally than you may think. At the same time, the preparation of this presentation caused me to doubt several things that I hadn{\textquoteright}t really suspected I would doubt. I{\textquoteright}d like to share those doubts with you.

This paper has three main points:

   1. Computer games (and games) are the great undescribed of our culture.
   2. We need a ludology - a theory of games - and to get one, academia must learn from the game development community.
   3. Games exist in a formal/algorithmic domain, stories in a domain of interpretation, and this means that games resist the evocative themes of stories, because they cannot be formalised."},

This article shows that asynchronous game-tree search algorithms can be as efficient as or better than synchronous methods in determining the minimax value. APHID, a new asynchronous parallel game-tree search algorithm, is presented. APHID is implemented as a freely available portable library, making the algorithm easy to integrate into a sequential game-tree searching program. APHID has been added to four programs written by different authors. APHID yields better speedups than synchronous search methods for an Othello and a checkers program and comparable speedups on two chess programs. },

	abstract = {Computer technology has ushered in a new era of mass media, bringing with it great promise and great concerns about the effect on children{\textquoteright}s development and wellbeing. Although we tend to see these issues as being new, similar promises and concerns have accompanied each new wave of media technology throughout the past century: films in the early 1900s, radio in the 1920s, and television in the 1940s. With the introduction of each of these technologies, proponents touted the educational benefits for children, while opponents voiced fears about exposure to inappropriate commercial, sexual, and violent content. This article places current studies on children and computers in a historical context, noting the recurrent themes and patterns in media research during the twentieth century. Initial research concerning each innovation has tended to focus on issues of access and the amount of time children were spending with the new medium. As use of the technology became more prevalent, research shifted to issues related to content and its effects on children. Current research on children{\textquoteright}s use of computers is again following this pattern. But the increased level of interactivity now possible with computer games and with the communication features of die Internet has heightened both the promise of greatly enriched learning and the concerns related to increased risk of harm. As a result, research on die effects of exposure to various types of content has taken on a new sense of urgency The authors conclude that to help inform and sustain die creation of more quality content for children, further research is needed on the effects of media on children, and new partnerships must be forged between industry, academia, and advocacy groups.},

	abstract = {Two epidemiologic studies have reported increased risk of childhood leukemia associated with the length of time children watched television (TV) programs or played video games connected to TV sets. To evaluate magnetic field exposures resulting from these activities, the static, ELF, and VLF magnetic fields produced by 72 TV sets used by children to watch TV programs and 34 TV sets used to play video games were characterized in a field study conducted in Washington DC and its Maryland suburbs. The resulting TV-specific magnetic field data were combined with information collected through questionnaires to estimate the magnetic field exposure levels associated with TV watching and video game playing. The geometric means of the ELF and VLF exposure levels so calculated were 0.0091 and 0.0016 mu T, respectively, for children watching TV programs and 0.023 and 0.0038 mu T, respectively, for children playing video games. Geometric means of ambient ELF and VLF levels with TV sets turned off were 0.10 and 0.0027 mu T, respectively. Summed over the ELF frequency range (6-3066 Hz), the exposure levels were small compared to ambient levels. However, in restricted ELF frequency ranges (120 Hz and 606-3066 Hz) and in the VLF band, TV exposure levels were comparable to or larger than normal ambient levels. Even so, the strengths of the 120 Hz or 606-3066 Hz components of TV fields were small relative to the overall ambient levels. Consequently, our results provide little support for a linkage between childhood leukemia and exposure to the ELF magnetic fields produced by TV sets. Our results do suggest that any future research on possible health effects of magnetic fields from television sets might focus on the VLF electric and magnetic fields produced by TV sets because of their enhanced ability relative to ELF fields to induce electric currents.},

One explanation is that the mechanism for change is generational: doctoral students transform research disciplines as they apply new electronic communication skills they "grew up with." This article examines this explanation and related claims through evidence from a study of 28 graduate students and their advisors in four disciplines at eight U.S. research universities. Although all the doctoral students used electronic communication technologies in various ways, their work practices reinforced existing patterns of work and resource use in their disciplines. Students used electronic communication to (1) mimic the electronic communication patterns of their advisor, (2) differentiate or specialize their research with respect to their advisor or research specialty, (3) enhance the social connections and material resources their advisor or institution provided to them, and/or (4) ease or improve "hands-on" research techniques (textual analysis, wet lab work, programming, statistical analysis) that their advisor or research group delegated to them.},

Correlational and multiple regression analyses were performed with ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), perceived importance of appearance, weight concerns, and media use (based on self-reported average weekly use of television, videotapes, video and computer games, and music videos). Results: Total media use was not significantly related to perceived importance of appearance or weight con cems. When media use was separated into distinct media genres, only hours of watching music videos was related to perceived importance of appearance and weight concerns (r = 0.12, p < .001, and v = .08, p < .05, respectively). In multivariate analyses, after controlling for BMI and ethnicity, no media use variables were significantly associated with either perceived importance of appearance or weight concerns. Conclusions: Frequent music video use may be a risk factor for increased perceived importance of appearance and increased weight concerns among adolescent girls.},

Students received a multimedia explanation of lightning formation (Experiments 1 and 2) or played an agent-based computer game about environmental science (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Instructional messages were presented in either a personalized style, where students received spoken or written explanations in the 1st- and 2nd- person points of view, or a neutral style, where students received spoken or written explanations in the 3rd-person point of view. Personalized rather than neutral messages produced better problem-solving transfer performance across all experiments and better retention performance on the computer game. The theoretical and educational implications of the findings are discussed.},

A suitable exercise program may help improve the SCI individual{\textquoteright}s cardiovascular fitness level. GAME(Wheels) is an interface between a custom wheelchair roller system and a computer that enables an individual to control computer video games by driving his or her wheelchair. The purpose of Phase 1 was to evaluate the design of the GAME(Wheels) system and to determine the type of computer video game that is likely to motivate wheelchair users to exercise. Phase 2 included physiologic testing of wheelchair users and the GAME(Wheels) system to investigate whether the system elicits an exercise training response. Thirty-five subjects were recruited to evaluate the GAME(Wheels) by Flaying three commercial computer games (Phase 1) and to identify the computer game that they would prefer to use when exercising. The feedback from Phase 1 was used with test subjects to verify that the GAME(Wheels) system elicits an exercise training effect (Phase 2). Phase 2 included 10 subjects using the GAME(Wheels) system to play Need for Speed II. During game play, physiologic data were collected and the subjects{\textquoteright} oxygen consumption and heart rate were analyzed. Analysis showed that the GAME(Wheels) system induced nine subjects to reach their tr;training zone, defined as 50\% and 60\% of their maximum oxygen consumption and heart rate, respectively. This study demonstrates that the GAME(Wheels) system elicits an exercise training response.},

A computer interface for wrist movements was developed and a study to justify the application of such a device is presented Method. Forty-seven patients in a day hand clinic who had traumatic fracture of one hand with limitation of wrist mobility participated in the study Participants were divided into true treatment groups: computer-aided treatment (high technology) and traditional brush machine treatment (low technology). A device was developed based on the brush machine in which the brush machine{\textquoteright}s mechanism tons converted into a medial-lateral joystick. Right-to- movements were digitally transformed for the use of a computer game, Participants were treated for 5 weeks, and outcome measures included range of motion (ROM) grip strength, edema, and level of interest Results. Results showed significant improvement in ROM, grip strength, and edema across 5 weeks for all participants. Although no significant differences were found between the true groups in ROM, grip strength, and enema, the computer-aided group showed significantly more interest in treatment than did the brush machine group. Finally the interaction between treatment group and the attitude toward computers was not significant. Conclusions. These results-indicate the potential for more interesting motor treatment and rehabilitation of the wrist through the use of computer games, The efficacy of using computers in occupational therapy clinics needs further investigation.},

Today, the charismatic 45-year- old is a "virtual CEO"-an off-site but supercharged consultant to flesh-and-blood CEOs at a number of start-up companies in Silicon Valley and beyond. But that was only after he{\textquoteright}d worked his way through 11 companies in 25 years -a crazy quilt of jobs as a music promoter, corporate lawyer, CFO at a software start- up, and chief executive at a video game company, just to name a few.

He realized there were alternatives to marching your way straight up the corporate ladder and that success in the new economy can involve a series of twists and turns. In this first-person account, Komisar describes why a nontraditional career path such as the one he unintentionally took may appeal to more businesspeople than might suspect it themselves. He tracks his professional journey along a sometimes tense, often enlightening, and ultimately prosperous course. He shares lessons learned along the way. Komisar also makes a strong business case for pursuing the passion-driven career; such a career, he says, makes supreme sense in the new economy because it{\textquoteright}s flexible and challenging - both for an individual and for the companies he chooses to work for.},

	pages = {123-144},
	abstract = {The increasing amount of time children are spending on computers at home and school has raised questions about how the use of computer technology may make a difference in their lives-from helping with homework to causing depression to encouraging violent behavior. This article provides an overview of the limited research on the effects of home computer use on children{\textquoteright}s physical, cognitive, and social development. Initial research suggests, for example, that access to computers increases the total amount of time children spend in front of a television or computer screen at the expense of other activities, thereby putting them at risk for obesity. At the same time, cognitive research suggests that playing computer games can be an important building block to computer literacy because it enhances children{\textquoteright}s ability to read and visualize images in three-dimensional space and track multiple images simultaneously. The limited evidence available also indicates that home computer use is linked to slightly better academic performance. The research findings are more mixed, however regarding the effects on children{\textquoteright}s social development. Although little evidence indicates that the moderate use of computers to play games has a negative impact on children{\textquoteright}s friendships and family relationships, recent survey data show that increased use of the Internet may be linked to increases in loneliness and depression. Of most concern are the findings that playing violent computer games may increase aggressiveness and desensitize a child to suffering, and that the use of computers may blur a child{\textquoteright}s ability to distinguish real life from simulation. The authors conclude that more systematic research is needed in these areas to help parents and policymakers maximize the positive effects and to minimize thr negative effects of home computers in children{\textquoteright}s lives.},

To better understand the triggering elements of visual stimuli and cortical mechanisms of hyperexcitability, we examined eleven patients with idiopathic photosensitive epilepsy by recording visually evoked potentials (VEPs) in response to temporally modulated patterns of different contrast. For stimuli of low-medium, but not high, temporal frequency, the contrast dependence of VEP amplitude and latency is remarkably abnormal for luminance contrast (black-white), but not so for chromatic contrast (equiluminant red-green) stimuli. We conclude that cortical mechanisms of contrast gain control for pattern stimuli of relatively low temporal frequency and high luminance contrast are lacking or severely impaired in photosensitive subjects.},

Play was not linked to self- esteem in girls, but a negative relationship was obtained between self-esteem and frequency of play in boys. However, self-esteem was not associated with total exposure to game play. Aggression scores were not related to the number of games with aggressive content named among three favourite games, but they were positively correlated with total exposure tu game play. A multiple regression analysis revealed that sex and total game play exposure each accounted for a significant but small amount of the variance in aggression scores. The positive correlation between playing computer games and aggression provides some justification for further investigation of the causal hypothesis, and possible methodologies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Using a video game format, this study examined the effects of time pressure (TP) on behavioral and electrocortical indices. The behavioral results were consistent with previous time pressure research in that TP reduced time to perform a task and increases behavioral errors. In addition, electroencephalogram (EEG) measures showed distinctive patterns associated with TP in the theta, mu, and gamma bands along the midline, Site specific changes in the success vs. failure trials were also seen in midline theta at Fz, gamma at Fz, and mu at Cz. Right parietal alpha also differentiated TP and success vs. failure trials. In specific TP (1) increased frontal midline theta activity and (2) increased gamma at. midline (frontal, central, and partietal) and in right frontal areas. The results of these findings are discussed in terms of the formation of specific neurocognitive strategies as evidenced by the topographic distribution of task-related modulation of the EEG within certain frequency bands. It is suggested that the effect of TP on visuomotor performance is mediated by adopting either task- relevant or task-irrelevant neurocognitive strategies as evidenced by successful or failed trials, respectively. Whether these strategies are formulated prior to performance or appear spontaneously during task performance remains unclear and is awaiting further experimentation.},

PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four obese children aged 8 - 12 y were randomized to one of three groups in which children had to accumulate 750 or 1500 pedometer counts to earn 10 min of access to video games or movies, or to a control group in which access to sedentary behaviors was provided noncontingently. MEASUREMENTS: Physical activity in the 20 min experimental session was measured by electronic pedometer and triaxial accelerometer (ie TriTrac(R)). Activity liking was measured by visual analog scales. Anthropometric and demographic characteristics were also assessed. RESULTS: Children in the 750 and 1500 count contingency groups engaged in significantly more physical activity and spent more time in moderate intensity activity or higher compared with controls. Children in the Contingent 1500 group engaged in more activity and spent more time in moderate or greater intensity activity compared to children in the Contingent 750 group. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that contingent access to sedentary activities can reinforce physical activity in obese children, and changes in physical activity level depend in part on the targeted physical activity goal.},

In many markets, such coordination is possible; firms can contract, for example, or integrate. In markets based on relatively new platform technologies, however, coordination will typically be difficult.

Measurements were performed at catheter insertion and before and immediately after the 2 stressors, which were separated by 20-minute rest periods. Blacks exhibited higher absolute levels of diastolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance index, or both in response to catheter insertion and to the video game challenge and during recovery from video game challenge and cold stimulation (P<0.05 for all). Blacks exhibited higher absolute levels of ET-1 at every evaluation point (P<0.05 for all) and greater increases in ET-1 in response to both stressors (ps<0.05). These findings suggest that altered endothelial function may be involved in racial differences in hemodynamic reactivity to stress and possibly in the development of essential hypertension.},

	abstract = {Reflex epilepsy of the visual system is charecterised by seizures precipitated by visual stimuli. EEC responses to intermittent photic stimulation depend on the age and sex of the subject and on how stimulation is performed: abnormalities:are commonest in children and adolescents, especially girls. Only generalised paroxysmal epileptiform discharges are clearly linked to epilepsy. Abnormal responses may occur in asymptomatic subjects, especially children. Photosensitivity has an important genetic component. Some patients are sensitive to patterns, suggesting an occipital trigger for these events. Myoclonus and generalised convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures may be triggered by visual stimuli. Partial seizures occur less often and can be confused with migraine. Although usually idiopathic, photosensitive epilepsy may occur in degenerative diseases and some patients with photosensitive partial seizures have brain lesions. Sunlight and video screens, including television, video games, and computer displays, are the commonest environmental triggers of photosensitive seizures. Outbreaks of triggered seizures have occurred when certain flashing or patterned images have been broadcast. There are regulations to prevent this in some countries only. Pure photosensitive epilepsy has a good prognosis. There is a role for treatment with and without antiepileptic drugs, but photosensitivity usually does not disappear spontaneously, and then typically in the third decade.},

	abstract = {Opportunities for children to be physically active during school time are sparse and becoming increasingly so. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if children would compensate for school days (9 a.m.-3 p.m.) of restricted physical activity opportunities by increasing activity levels after school (3 p.m.-7:30 p.m.). Third and fourth grade children (N = 76) each wore a CSA accelerometer of 4 nonconsecutive days. Two days were categorized as active-during school, all children participated in outdoor recess and physical education class. Two days were categorized as restricted-all children spent their recess time outdoors at a computer terminal, and no physical education class. Two days were categorized as restricted-all children spent their time indoors at a computer terminal, and no physical education class was scheduled. Dependent t tests revealed that children did not compensate for a sedentary school day by increasing their levels of physical activity after school. In fact, average movement counts per minute were higher in the 3 p.m.-7:30 p.m. following the active day (525 counts.min(-1)) versus the restricted day (186 counts.min(-1)). These findings suggest cause for concern if children{\textquoteright}s opportunities to be active within school time are limited. Several reasons are given as to why children did not compensate or "make up" for the physical activity opportunities missed during the restricted school day.},

Since most of these applications use TCP as the transport layer protocol, the key to their efficiency largely depends on TCP protocol performance. We investigate the performance of TCP in terms of effective throughput in an HFC network environment using different load conditions and network buffer sizes. We find that TCP experiences low throughput as a result of the well- known problem of ACK compression. An algorithm that controls ACK spacing is introduced to improve TCP performance.},

This paper offers six propositions for structure, causality, visibility and interaction, which appear to produce cognitive, emotive and sensory engagement in users{\textquoteright} reactions to a narrative multimedia design. The developmental approach was phenomenological. The propositions derive from a focus group study in which 12 users played with four commercial computer games, then we (and they) analysed their reactions. Two observations from the study inform the morphology of narrative. Firstly, there is a fundamental conflict between narrative in its traditional form and interactivity, and secondly, the primal features of narrative-causality temporality and linearity-are disrupted within a hyper structure. The first set of propositions suggests solutions for such conflicts. These are spatial containment, causality, and demands on user{\textquoteright}s skills. Further propositions for engaging interaction are causality of dialogue, apparent intelligence of the program and hiding the delivery medium.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Physical fitness and physical activity cracking data enhance our understanding as to when children settle into their long-term exercise and fitness patterns and, therefore, provide insight as to when programs focusing on preventing sedentary adults behaviors should be initiated. Methods: In this paper, the tracking of physical fitness and physical activity was examined in a 5-yr population-based study of children and adolescents in Muscatine, IA. Study subjects (N = 126) were pre- or early-pubescent at baseline (mean age boys 10.8 yr and girls 10.3 yr). Physical fitness was measured using direct determination of oxygen uptake and maximal voluntary isometric contraction while physical activity was assessed via questionnaire. Results: Boys classified as sedentary based on initial measurements of TV viewing and video game playing were 2.2 times more likely than their peers to also be classified as sedentary at follow-up. Tracking of most physical fitness and physical activity variables was moderate to high, indicating some predictability of early measurements for later values. Sedentary behavior tracked better in boys, whereas vigorous activity tended to track better in girls. Conclusion: These observations suggest that preventive efforts focused on maintaining physical fitness and physical activity through puberty will have favorable health benefits in later years.},

After each story participants were asked a series of questions about the harmdoer{\textquoteright}s intent, potential retaliation toward the harmdoer, and about the harmdoer{\textquoteright}s emotional slate. Responses were coded in terms of amount of negative and violent content. Results indicate that those male participants reading the violent comic books responded more negatively on the ambiguous provocation story questions than male participants reading the mildly violent comic books. For females, responding was primarily governed by trait hostility These data suggest that hostile attributional bias may be influenced by gender; trait hostility, and exposure to violent media.},

	abstract = {For daily burn wound care procedures, opioid analgesics alone are often inadequate. Since most burn patients experience severe to excruciating pain during wound care, analgesics that can be used in addition to opioids are needed. This case report provides the first evidence that entering an immersive virtual environment can serve as a powerful adjunctive, nonpharmacologic analgesic. Two patients received virtual reality VR, to distract them from high levels of pain during wound care. The first was a 16-year-old male with a deep flash burn on his right leg requiring surgery and staple placement. On two occasions, the patient spent some of his wound care in VR, and some playing a video game. On a 100 mm scale, he provided sensory and affective pain ratings, anxiety and subjective estimates of time spent thinking about his pain during the procedure. For the first session of wound care, these scores decreased 80 mm, 80 mm, 58 mm, and 93 mm, respectively, during VR treatment compared with the video game control condition. For the second session involving staple removal, scores also decreased. The second patient was a 17- year-old male with 33.5\% total body surface area deep hash bums on his face, neck, back, arms, hands and legs. He had difficulty tolerating wound care pain with traditional opioids alone and showed dramatic drops in pain ratings during VR compared to the video game (e.g, a 47 mm drop in pain intensity during wound care). We contend that VR is a uniquely attention- capturing medium capable of maximizing the amount of attention drawn away from the {\textquoteright}real world{\textquoteright}, allowing patients to tolerate painful procedures. These preliminary results suggest that immersive VR merits more attention as a potentially viable form of treatment for acute pain.},

This has led many people to assert that this may have a detrimental effect on individuals who play such games. Despite continuing controversy for over 15 years, there has been little in the way of systematic research. This article reviews the empirical studies in this area, including research methodologies such as the observation of free play, self-report methods, and experimental studies. The article argues that all the published studies on video game violence have methodological problems and that they only include possible short-term measures of aggressive consequences. The one consistent finding is that the majority of the studies on very young children-as opposed to those in their teens upwards-tend to show that children do became more aggressive after either playing or watching a violent video game. However, all of these come from the use of one particular research methodology (i.e., observation of children{\textquoteright}s free play).},

For this purpose, a 3d model is enriched with docking positions which allow objects to be connected together. As complex 3d interactions are required to compose 3d objects, sophisticated 3d visualization- and interaction techniques are included. Among these techniques are shadow generation, 3d input devices, snapping mechanisms and collision detection. The puzzle, similar to a computer game, can be operated at different levels. To simplify the task, a subset of the geometry, e.g. the skeleton, can be correctly assembled initially. Moreover, textual information concerning the region of objects is provided, along with snapping mechanisms to support the user. With this approach we expect. to motivate students to explore the spatial relations between parts of the human body.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine the extent to which physical activity and inactivity patterns vary by ethnicity among subpopulations of US adolescents. Study design: Nationally representative data from the 1996 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health of >14,000 US adolescents (including 3135 non-Hispanic blacks, 2446 Hispanics, and 976 Asians). Methods: Hours per week of inactivity (TV viewing, playing video or computer games) and times per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity were collected by using questionnaire data. Multinomial logistic regression models of physical activity and inactivity were used to adjust for sociodemographic factors. Results: Large ethnic differences are seen for inactivity, particularly for hours of television or video viewing per week (non-Hispanic blacks, mean = 20.4; non-Hispanic whites, mean = 13.1). Physical activity (greater than or equal to 5 bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, 5-8 metabolic equivalents) is lowest for female and minority adolescents. Ethnic differences are far greater for inactivity than for moderate to vigorous physical activity. Conclusion: Minority adolescents, with the exception of Asian females, have consistently higher levels of inactivity. Results vary by sex; males have higher inactivity and physical activity, whereas lowest physical activity is found for non-Hispanic black and Asian females, although Asian females also have low inactivity and low levels of overweight. Overall, efforts to reduce the problem of adolescent overweight should focus on increasing activity levels of adolescents, particularly female, older, and major minority subpopulations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of physical activity, television program viewing and other forms of video viewing with the prevalence of obesity among school children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: 712 children, 9-16 y old, from a low- and a middle-income town in the Mexico City area. MEASUREMENTS: Children completed a self administered questionnaire to assess time spent in physical activity and television viewing, and diet. Height weight and triceps skinfolds were measured. The outcome variable was obesity, and the covariates were hours of television programs and other video viewing, physical activity, energy intake, percentage of energy from fat, town of location of school, age, gender and perception of mother{\textquoteright}s weight status. RESULTS: Among 461 children with complete information, 24\% were classified as obese. Children reported an average of 4.1 +/- 2.2 h/d watching television (2.4 +/- 1.5 h/d for TV programs and 1.7 +/- 1.5 h/d for video cassette recorder (VCR) or videogames), and 1.8 +/- 1.3 h/d in moderate and vigorous physical activities. Odds ratios (OR) of obesity were 12\% higher for each hour of television program viewing per day (OR = 1.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.02,-1.22), and 10\% lower for each hour of moderate/vigorous physical activity per day (OR = 0.90, 95\% CI 0.83 - 0:98), controlling for age, gender, town and perception of mother{\textquoteright}s weight status. Children in the middle-income town had higher adjusted odds of obesity (OR = 2.58, 95\% CI 1.47 - 4.54). CONCLUSION: Physical activity and television viewing, but not VCR/videogames use, were related to obesity prevalence in Mexican children 9-16 y old.},

While there were no sex differences in computer comfort and engagement, males appeared to be more prone to over-use, but this was not mediated by sex differences in femininity. Both femininity and masculinity seem to be propitious for the development of positive computer orientations, and greater female negativity toward computers is waning. The expansion of computer applications into non-male dominated areas, such as interpersonal communication, is cited as an explanation for these observations. },

The method accepts as input an interactive plot, a 2-D layout of the 3-D space in which the story will play out and a list of possible behaviors for each of the objects in this space. It then composes 3-D renditions for each story action by assigning behaviors to the objects in the scene. These renditions are enriched with appropriate multimedia effects that seek to emphasize their dramatic nature. The effectiveness of this method is currently being tested in user trials of an interactive adventure story that has been deployed on the Web.},

Children{\textquoteright}s responses to the provoking play sessions-facial expressions, verbalizations, and gestures- were reliably coded. Overall, children in these age groups maintained a remarkable degree of composure. Girls made fewer negative comments than boys did, and fewer negative gestures.

When they spoke, older children made fewer negative comments, fewer remarks about the game, and fewer positive comments about themselves or the actor.},

In the study we assumed that design characteristics add to the interest in learning and we developed taxonomy of design of efficient user interfaces both for boys and girls. The research included 90 children from three kindergarten classes, who were exposed to interactive multimedia stories. The research subjects, with the help of a Pollimeter (Lampert, S.I., 1981, A new scale for consumer research: The Pollimeter combines properties for data collection and data analysis. Journal of Advertising Research, 21(2), 2329), answered to questionnaires, which examined their level of time on task acid their level of satisfaction with the various interfaces. The research findings indicate that there is a significant difference between boys and girls in the influence of the design of the learning interfaces on their level of time on task as well as on their level of satisfaction with the different interfaces. Boys on the one hand had a higher level of time on task, and were more familiar with computer games so they looked for assistance through navigational buttons; girls on the other hand tended to ask for help with the game. Girls preferred to include writing into the game and preferred colourful screens full of drawings, which changed slowly. We also found that boys preferred green and blue colours, whilst the girls preferred red and yellow. Generally speaking, we found that girls preferred the components of the Mise-en-scene interface, and boys preferred the components of the Montage interface.},

These observations are confirmed by studies of physical fitness and endurance, These measures have also declined among youth, Much has been learned about the factors associated with physical activity among youth, These factors were used to develop several innovative school-based programs which demonstrate increased physical activity and performance, Recommendations are made for increasing physical activity both in the school curriculum and outside the school day, Potential health benefits and likely effects on obesity are substantial.},

	abstract = {A study was undertaken to analyse the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) and confounding factors in primary school children in the city of Antwerp. A total of 392 children aged 9 were included in the study. All children completed a validated three-page questionnaire and they all underwent a specific lumbar spine oriented medical examination during their annual routine medical school control. This examination was performed by the city school doctors. The questionnaire was composed of easy "yes/no" questions and visual analogue scales. Statistical analysis was performed using Student{\textquoteright}s t-test and chi-squared test at the significance level P < 0.05. The prevalence of LBP was high. No gender difference was found. A total of 142 children (36\%) reported having suffered at least one episode of LBP in their lives. Of these, 33 (23\%) had sought medical help fur LBP from a doctor or physiotherapist. Sixty-four percent of children reporting LBP said that at least one of their parents suffered from or complained of LBP. This was significantly higher than for the children who did not report having suffered LBP. The way in which the school satchel was carried (in the hand, on the back) had no bearing on the incidence of LBP. There was significantly more LBP in children who reported playing video games for more than 2 h per day, but this was not so for television watchers. The visual analogue scales concerning general well-being were all very significantly correlated with self-reported LBP, with children who reported LBP being more tired, less happy, and worse sleepers. Of the 19 clinical parameters taken down during the medical examination, only one was significantly more prevalent in the group of children reporting LBP: pain on palpation at the insertion site on the iliac crest of the iliolumbar ligament. From this study we can establish that there are few clinical signs that can help to single out school children with LBP.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying video-game epilepsy by comparing the flicker- and spatial-frequency ranges over which photic and pattern stimulation elicited photoparoxysmal responses in two different populations: (a) 25 patients with a history of seizures experienced while playing video games; and (b) 25 age- and medication-matched controls with a history of photosensitive epilepsy, but no history of video-game seizures. METHODS: Abnormality ranges were determined by measuring photoparoxysmal EEG abnormalities as a function of the flicker frequency of patterned and diffuse intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) and the spatial frequency of patterns on a raster display. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in respect of the abnormality ranges elicited by patterned or diffuse IPS or by spatial patterns. When the groups were compared at one specific IPS frequency (-50 Hz), however, the flicker frequency of European television displays, the video-game patients were significantly more likely to be sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that video-game seizures are a manifestation of photosensitive epilepsy. The increased sensitivity of video-game patients to IPS at 50 Hz indicates that display flicker may underlie video-game seizures. The similarity in photic- and pattern-stimulation ranges over which abnormalities are elicited in video-game patients and controls suggests that all patients with photosensitive epilepsy may be predisposed toward video-game-induced seizures. Photosensitivity screening should therefore include assessment by using both IPS at 50 Hz and patterns displayed on a television or monitor with a 50-Hz frame rate.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We evaluated a new noninvasive outpatient method of pelvic muscle retraining in children using computer game assisted biofeedback. Materials and Methods: All patients in whom voiding dysfunction was confirmed by history, uroflowmetry-electromyography and voiding cystourethrography were enrolled in a pelvic floor muscle retraining program. Patients received a pretreatment, mid treatment and posttreatment survey instrument documenting subjective improvement, including the frequency of diurnal enuresis, nocturnal enuresis, constipation and encopresis. Pretreatment and posttreatment simultaneous uroflowmetry surface electrode electromyography was performed and post-void residual urine volume was determined in all patients. Results: A total of 8 boys and 33 girls 5 to 11 years old (mean age 7.2) completed therapy and were available for evaluation. These patients completed 2 to 11 (average 6) hourly treatment sessions. Followup was 3 to 15 months (average 7). At the midterm evaluation improvement in nocturnal enuresis was reported by 57\% of the patients, diurnal enuresis by 84\%, constipation by 83\% and encopresis by 91\%. End treatment evaluation revealed improvement in nocturnal enuresis by 90\% of patients, diurnal enuresis by 89\%, constipation by 100\% and encopresis by 100\%. Uroflowmetry-electromyography patterns improved in 42\% of the patients and post-void residual urine decreased in 57\%. Comparison of initial to end recorded millivoltage pelvic floor muscle values demonstrated that 56\% of the patients had lower resting tone at the beginning of the session after completing therapy and 78\% had improved contracting tone after performing Kegel exercises, as proved by increased microvoltage values. Initial uroflowmetry-electromyography revealed certain categories of cases, including a flattened voiding curve with a hyperactive pelvic floor and low post-void residual urine in 40\%, a flattened voiding curve with a hyperactive pelvic floor and high post-void residual-urine in 40\%, a staccato voiding curve with a hyperactive pelvic floor and low post-void residual urine in 3\%, and a staccato voiding curve with a hyperactive pelvic floor and high post-void residual urine in 17\%. Of the girls 91\% presented with the classic spinning top deformity on voiding cystourethrography. A total of 22 patients presented with a significant history of recurrent urinary tract infections, and infection developed in 3 during treatment and followup. Vesicoureteral reflux in 14 patients resolved during treatment in 3, reimplantation was performed in 1 and 10 are still being observed. Conclusions: A program of conservative medical management with computer game assisted pelvic floor muscle retraining resulted in significant subjective improvement in continence, constipation and encopresis as well as objective improvement in uroflowmetry-electromyography, post-void residual urine volume and the microvoltage value of pelvic floor muscles in the majority of patients with dysfunctional voiding.},

Indeed, heavier computer use was associated with significantly greater participation in cultural and other free time activities, even after multivariate adjustment. These results reinforce conclusions from earlier surveys showing higher mass media use among home computer users rather than displacement, as occurred with the introduction of television. These results reinforce the conclusion that personal computers might have more in common with "time-enhancing" home appliances such as the telephone than they do with television.},

It is argued that this modelling activity provides insights into the motivational appeal that often distinguishes computer games from other forms of human computer interaction. The long-term aim behind this research is to use our improved understanding of interaction with computer games to inform the subsequent development of more general classes of interactive systems. Barnard{\textquoteright}s Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS) is used throughout this paper. This decision is justified by the fact that ICS has already been applied to analyse the negative emotions surrounding clinical depression. This previous work provides a useful starting point for our investigation of the more positive emotions evoked during interaction with computer games. A further justification is that ICS has also been successfully used to represent and reason about the design of human computer interfaces.},

Success in Metagame competitions is evidence of a more general kind of ability than that possessed by (for example) a chess program or a draughts program. In this paper, we take up one of Pell{\textquoteright}s challenges by building a Metagame player that can learn. The learning techniques used are a refinement of the regression methods of Christensen and Korf, and they are applied to unsupervised learning, from self-play, of the weights of the components (or advisors) of the evaluation function. The method used leads to significant improvement in playing strength for many (but not all) games in the class. We also shed light on some curious behaviour of some advisor weights.

	abstract = {With the introduction of Nintendo video-games on a large scale, reports of children having seizures while playing suggested a possible specific, provocative factor. Although 50\% of the photosensitive patients are also sensitive to a 50-1-12 television, nonphotosensitive patients with a history of videogame seizures were described as well. The question arises whether this is a mere coincidence, provoked by fatigue and stress, is related to the reaction to the television screen itself, or depends on the movement and color of the pictures of this specific game. A European study was performed in four countries and five sites. All patients were selected because of a history of television, video- or computer-game seizures, with a history of sunlight-, discotheque-, or black and white pattern-evoked seizures, or were already known to be sensitive to intermittent photic stimulation. A total of 387 patients were investigated; 220 (75\%) were female and 214 (55\%) of those were <18 years of age. After a routine examination, intermittent photic, pattern, and television stimulation were performed in a standardized way. The patients were investigated with Super Mario World and a standard relatively nonprovocative TV program, both on a 50- and 100-Hz television. Regardless of the distance, Super Mario World proved to be more provocative than the standard program (Wilcoxon, p < 0.05), Eighty-five percent showed epi leptiform discharges evoked by intermittent photic stimulation. Forty-five percent of patients were 50-Hz television sensitive and 26\% were 100-Hz television sensitive. Pattern sensitivity was found in 28\% of patients. The patients, referred because of a television, video- or computer-game seizure, were significantly more sensitive to pattern and to the 50-Hz television (chi square, p < 0.001). More patients are sensitive when playing Super Mario, compared with the standard program (Wilcoxon, p = 0.001) and more sensitive with playing versus viewing (p = 0.016). Of the patients who were referred because of seizures in front of the television, or evoked by a video- or computer game, 14\% proved not to be photosensitive. Although no difference in age or use of medication was found, twice as many men were found in this nonphotosensitive group.},

The system can robustly track facial features, can detect tracking failures and has an automatic mechanism for error recovery. The system is insensitive to lighting changes and occulsions or distortion of the facial features. The system is user independent and can automatically calibrate for each different user. An application using this technology for driver fatigue detection and the evaluation of ergonomic design of motor vehicles has been developed. Our human-machine interface has an enormous potential in other applications that allow the control of machines and processes, and measure human performance.

Did twenty-five elementary school children who regularly participated in an after-school computer club during an academic year (treatment group) learn generalizable problem-solving skills as compared to twenty-five non-participating peers who were matched for grade level, gender, and English language proficiency (comparison group)? Based on a dynamic assessment given at the end of the academic year, treatment students were more successful than comparison students in learning how to play a new educational computer game that was presented as a paper-and-pencil mathematics puzzle learning task. This study shows how an informal educational environment can foster generalizable problem-solving skills that transfer to learning in a school environment.},

Some present and recent past architectures will be shortly introduced in the second half of this paper, and compared with what could be considered as the ideal properties of an enhanced audio system, able to support the future tools and standards for Multimedia and Virtual Reality, and naturally MPEG-4 above them all. The main goal of this brief presentation is to analyze in which direction these attractive features of the new audio applications are pushing the computational requirements, to detect how the DSPs and multimedia processors are evolving, and finally to conclude with some considerations on the state of the art architectures.},

{\textquoteright}The growth of this new play culture has not been publically acknowledged. Comparing it with the more glamourized internet technology Stiles (1995), notes that this industries astounding success is due to the manufacturers{\textquoteright} constant innovations in technology and programming. The current home consoles (sold for under $200 in Canada) pack as much processing capacity as thousands of those original PDP{\textquoteright}s and 10 times that of the latest Pentium PC{\textquoteright}s. Moreover, recent advances in 3D graphics means kids are playing the latest versions of Doom, Mortal Kombat, and Final Fantasy on extremely advanced 10 MIP consoles with computational speeds and graphics display chips exceeding those of most engineering workstations.  In his book Being Digital (1995), Nicholas Negroponte of the MIT media lab similarly claims that the growth of video gaming is just another indication of the way computers are increasingly transforming so many aspects of human communication. "We are not waiting on any invention. It is here. It is now. It is almost genetic in its nature, in that each generation will become more digital than the proceeding one. The control bits of that digital future are more than ever before in the hands of the young. Nothing could make me happier."{\textquoteright}},

It is further argued that contrary to the claims by the authors: The decision variable partition model advocated by the authors fails to account for the results reported in the article, but there is one error model--the combined error model--that predicts the observed symmetric hard-easy effect with crossover at proportion correct .75. Finally, an analysis of 44 cognitive and 21 sensory tasks demonstrates that there is a difference in calibration for sensory and cognitive tasks. },

However, a simulation system imposes stringent requirements on the human-machine interface. A sense of touch greatly enhances the simulation experience, since much of the skill that a medical professional possesses is in his ability to explore and diagnose by touch. This sensory input carl be provided by an input device with force and/or tactile feedback. There are many technical challenges associated with the creation of a robust surgical-simulation system incorporating touch feedback. The medical application has unique needs that drive the design of the mechanism, the control scheme, the tissue deformation engine, and the overall system architecture and distribution of computation. This technology is riot yet mature; several companies are dedicated to creating various parts of a simulation system, but as yet there are no commercially available solutions that are cost effective. Interest in force-feedback devices is gaining momentum in the commercial sector, however, notably in the area of personal computer games. We believe this interest will drive down the cost of components and spur research efforts so that better, more cost-effective force-feedback devices will be available to the medical community for use in widespread surgical-simulation systems.},

The uncritical adoption of technological advances combined with reduced local authority resources to drive curriculum development have resulted in failure to embed one of the most radical educational initiatives of the late 20th-century.},

No significant relationship was found between video game use in general and aggressive behaviour, but a significant negative relationship with prosocial behaviour was supported. However, separate analyses for boys and girls did not reveal this relationship. More consistent results were found for the preference for aggressive video games: children, especially boys, who preferred aggressive video games were more aggressive and showed less prosocial behaviour than those with a low preference for these games. Further analyses showed that children who preferred playing aggressive video games tended to be less intelligent.},

Males played computer games significantly more regularly than did females and were significantly more likely to play sports simulation games and violent games. Females were found to play platform games and puzzlers significantly more than did males. It is suggested that computer game playing for most children is a fairly absorbing and harmless activity but that, for a small minority of children, it may be problematic.},

This statement holds good for any interactive multimedia services, the content is what the consumer is seeking to access - and indeed most of what the consumer is paying for.

	abstract = {Aim: To provide baseline data concerning the eating habits of young adolescents which will enable trends to be identified, the factors affecting food choice to be explored and a programme of intervention to be designed and evaluated. Methods: A dietary screening survey, delivered by computer, was completed by 707 schoolchildren aged 11-14 years attending schools in two of the least affluent areas of Liverpool. Eating habits were compared to two previous studies which used an identical computerized dietary survey method. Results: The results suggest that many children chose the least desirable foods, which is likely to result in them eating a poor quality diet. The most popular foods included snack foods such as crisps, chocolates and sweets, and sugared fizzy drinks and chips. A number of trends were noted: there was a decrease in the reported consumption of added sugar and high-fibre cereals, and an increase in the use of low-fat milk. Boys claimed to be more active than girls, and there was an inverse relationship between physical activities and watching TV and playing computer games in girls. The results showed similar eating patterns and physical activity levels to those from other more complex studies. Conclusion: The responses of the children indicated, at the very least, some increasing awareness of healthy eating messages, but whether changes in behaviour were occurring is less clear. There is still, however, scope for further positive change in eating habits and the survey will be repeated at regular intervals to examine trends.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Seizures provoked by television viewing may be triggered by patterns in the television image or by flicker from the display itself. We examined the incidence of EEG abnormalities elicited by patterns displayed on television sets with two different frame rates to evaluate the likely contribution of photosensitive and pattern-sensitive mechanisms to television- and video-game epilepsy. METHODS: Televisions with frame rates of 50 and 100 Hz were used to present 35 patients who were photosensitive or pattern-sensitive with grating patterns. These patterns comprised vertical square-wave and sine-wave gratings of 90\% contrast, and the spatial frequency was varied between 0.25-7 cycles/degree. EEGs were analysed for laboratory sensitivity to patterned and unpatterned intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). RESULTS: Significantly fewer EEG abnormalities were elicited by patterns displayed on the 100 Hz frame-rate television than on the 50-Hz frame-rate television. No abnormalities were observed in response to the blank screens of either television. Thirty-three patients showed abnormalities in response to patterned IPS but only 15 in response to diffuse flash. Two patients showed no laboratory evidence of photosensitivity. Patients who were sensitive to patterned IPS at 50 Hz were significantly more likely to demonstrate abnormalities to patterns displayed on the 100-Hz frame-rate television than were patients who were not sensitive to 50-Hz patterned IPS. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that for many patients, the combination of high-contrast patterns and screen flicker may elicit the observed EEG abnormalities. For patients with sensitivity to screen flicker, the use of a high frame-rate television may be beneficial in reducing the risk of seizures.},

Responses related to video games yielded the predictor. Three criterion measures from the ATST (error, arrival delay, handoff delay) were regressed on a cognitive aptitude measure and the predictor variable. Self-reported experience on video games accounted for an additional 3.6\% of the variance in arrival delay, and an additional 9\% in handoff delay.

The video games are designed to enhance several intervening, or mediating, cognitive and behavioral factors that make a significant contribution to improving health status. The factors include (1) attention to and active processing of health promotion messages, (2) motivation to learn about health, (3) health knowledge and skills that are essential for implementing proper prevention and self-care, (4) self-concepts related to health, such as self-esteem and perceived self-efficacy for carrying out desirable health behaviors, and (5) communication about one{\textquoteright}s own health with peers, family, and caregivers who can provide social support for behavior change. This chapter includes a review of current research that confirms the importance of these factors in improving health behaviors and outcomes. The chapter also presents findings from six studies of the health education video games. The studies demonstrate that appropriately designed video games can improve many of the mediating factors that are known to contribute to better health.},

Before and after this play period, measures of reaction time (Sternberg Test), cognitive/perceptual adaptability (Stroop Color Word Test), and emotional well-being (self-report questionnaire) were administered. Playing video games was related to a significant improvement in the Sternberg reaction time task, and to a relative increase in self-reported well-being. On the Stroop Color Word Test, both the experimental and control groups improved significantly, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant. The videogame-playing group had faster reaction times and felt a more positive sense of well-being compared to their nonplaying counterparts. Consistent with previous research on video games and the elderly, the present study finds the strongest effects on measures of reaction time, and the weakest effects on cognitive performance measures.

This study investigated the effects of a gaming approach on knowledge acquisition and retention in military trainees. Three groups of trainees were presented with subject matter either in paper-based prose form (Text), paper-based question and answer (Test) form, or using computerbased gaming techniques (Game). These conditions were selected to i<strong>nvestigate potential benefits of computer-based gaming over traditional paper and pencil media in terms of trainee performance and reaction</strong>. Results showed that <strong>participants assigned to the Game condition scored significantly higher on a retention test as compared to pretest performance.</strong> Participants assigned to the Test and Text conditions showed no difference in performance from pretest to retention test. Additionally, participants assigned to the Game condition rated the training they received as more enjoyable and more effective than those assigned to the other two conditions. Results are discussed in terms of the effectiveness of computer-based games for military training applications.

	note = {<p>Extract:
<p>It is difficult to formulate an argument about the gender and racial inequalities in video games without an understanding of where the majority of video games come from. In 1994 over seventy percent of video games released in America were originally designed in Japan.4 Despite this fact, many researchers have attempted to argue about these issues using American concepts of inequality. This is something that is clearly erroneous and will lead to inaccurate results.
<p>To anyone researching the topic, it is quite obvious that the majority of characters in the video game universe are male. It is also obvious that the majority of human characters (excluding of course, non-human characters such as robots, beasts, vegetables and worms) are primarily white. Thus, it is easy to leap to conclusions that such video games were programmed by white males with politically incorrect values. However, this conclusion quickly falls apart when one finds a string of Asian names in the credits.
<p>So if the games are primarily programmed by Asian programmers, why then do they contain mainly Caucasian people? The immediate answer would be that they are trying to appeal to the Caucasian market (America, Europe, etc.) However this conclusion disseminates when the fact that nearly sixty percent of the world gaming market is dominated by the Japanese gamer is brought into light.4 With that kind of majority, the Japanese gamer would have sufficient influence to alter any insulting practices of the video game producer. },

The 14-year old patient had no family history of epilepsy, while the 16 year old had a family history of epilepsy. A comprehensive electroencephalogram (EEG), including hyperventilation, intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) and pattern stimulation were carried out on them and EEG abnormalities including photoparoxysmal responses (PPR) and generalized myoclonic responses were evoked. A thorough analysis of the EEG morphology of the myclonic responses and the clinical manifestations showed evidence of two separate entitles of seizures namely: visually evoked pattern-myoclonic responses (PTMR) and visually evoked photomyoclonic responses (PMR). PTMR was independent of flash rate and occurred before a PPR and at the same time as the flash rate, while PMR occurred after the PPR and was dependent on flash rate. These findings suggest that \&quot;Video Game\&quot; epilepsy is probably a pattern sensitive epilepsy, electronic screen being the source of the triggering patterns; hence, the morphology and the family histories and the myoclonic phenomena differ from those of pure photosensitive epilepsy.

They were given introductory CAD/COM instructions to perform on the computer, followed by written and practical tests. When instruction involved high element interactivity, the self-contained manual was vastly superior to instructional formats that involved continual interaction with the computer in both written and practical tests. No differences were found between instructional formats when the learning material entailed low element interactivity. },

The NES Continuous Performance Test (CPT) was modified to use animal silhouettes as stimuli instead of letters. Almost all children completed Finger Tapping (FT), the modified CPT, and Hand-Eye Coordination (HE). However, 18\% of the children missed at least 25\% of the stimuli on the CPT (full test period)? and 37\% of the children did not improve their HE performance by at least 10\%, as compared to the first trial. Boys obtained better results than girls, and older children performed better than younger ones. However, both factors were confounded by acquaintance with computer games. Children who used glasses, who had strabismus, or who had decreased contrast sensitivity obtained less satisfactory scores, especially on CPT and HE. The NES performance was significantly associated with functional neurological performance, including catching a ball, diadochokinesia, and finger agnosia. Slight, though statistically significant, decrements were seen with increased levels of prenatal exposure to neurotoxicants, as indicated by the mercury concentrations in cord blood obtained at the time of birth. In conclusion, the tests were feasible in this age group after slight modifications, and the test results showed meaningful associations with major predictors, thus supporting the validity of the data.},

	abstract = {Explaining the emergence of cooperative behaviours in a selfish world remains a major challenge for sociobiology. The iterated prisoner{\textquoteright}s dilemma offers a well-studied metaphor with which to explore theoretically the evolution of cooperation by reciprocation. Our current understanding is that {\textquoteright}tit-for-tat{\textquoteright} should be the very first step (if not the aim) of evolution towards cooperation, but that mobility of the players in space seems to raise a devastating obstacle to the spread of tit-for-tat, by allowing egoists to exploit cooperation and escape retaliation. The second point is based on models that represent mobility only implicitly (in terms of travelling costs) and assume random interactions. Here we develop a more explicit theory of spatial iterated games: individual mobility is represented in terms of a diffusion process and interactions - defined locally - are inherently non-random. Our model reveals the existence of critical levels of individual mobility allowing for the evolution of cooperation. In fact, tit-for-tat can spread and take over among mobile players even when originating from extreme rarity. The dynamics of invasion of tit-for-tat develop as a travelling wave which propagates the cooperative strategy through space. Significant mobility is required to make the pioneering moves of cooperators towards the front of invasion less hazardous; it also contributes to neutralizing those defectors who may intrude the core of a cluster of cooperative players.},

Special attention was given to students who were heavy users of computers, which was associated with high SES and superiority in grades.

The same survey also investigated year 8 pupils{\textquoteright} reading of comics and periodicals as well as their viewing habits. It also elicited similar information about a smaller group, approximately four hundred strong, of year 10 (14-15-year-old) pupils including their reading of fiction and non-fiction. These further findings form the basis of this article and extend the inquiry to the reading of magazines and comics in years 8 and 10, the watching of television and the time spent in viewing videos and in playing computer games. The pattern of reading, showing the dominance of American teenage horror stories is similar to that of the year 8 group and the downward trend in the amount of both boys{\textquoteright} and girls{\textquoteright} optional reading is confirmed, with a particular decline noted in the reading of books by year 10 boys. The marked difference between the nature of boys{\textquoteright} and girls{\textquoteright} comics and magazines is noted. Whilst the amount of television viewing has remained fairly constant over several years, the nature of the viewing had changed greatly and some pupils-particularly boys-were spending a considerable amount of time in front of screens of various sorts in any one day. The relationship between these factors is considered.},

The satisfactions afforded by acquired expertise are a cardinal ingredient of the computer game experience, but anathema to the current conception of effective interface design for nongame applications. The author argues that this is a serious omission that debases the expressive and communicative possibilities of interactivity. In the rush to develop the interface that requires a no-effort, no-time learning curve, producers sacrifice the pleasures of connoisseurship and expertise, necessary features for the comprehension and appreciation of art and literature, whether it is "high" or "low," serious or playful, mainstream or avant-garde.},

It is suggested that older adults can benefit significantly from ongoing education and that computers can be a valuable tool in this process. The cognitive capacities of older adults are discussed, with particular attention paid to long- and short-term memory functioning. The use of computers for memory skills training is highlighted. A study was undertaken using the computer game "Memory of Goblins" at the Seattle Day Center for Adults. This article describes both the game and how the project was conducted. Limitations of the study are presented. Although the authors acknowledge that conclusions are difficult to draw from this particular study, there is evidence to suggest that the impact of computer use among the elderly population can be profound. Implications for future research are presented.},

Previous work on games and how they might be applied to the design of software, primarily in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), has suggested that features of games may be used to design more effective computer systems (through more motivational interfaces). The paper will argue the opposite - that game-like features are, in fact, inappropriate to the design of applications systems and their user interfaces and are more effective in the design of computer-based training materials. Three main arguments are presented to support this: the cultural distinction between work and recreation, the transient motivational effect of games, and the differences in use of computer systems.},

The program provides a comprehensive authoring shell using which non technical staff can produce complete adventures tailored to their clients{\textquoteright} needs. Each stage of an adventure provides a short introduction explaining either the starting problem or the results of the last choice made and offering up to three choices of action. Once an option is selected OPTEXI will move on to show the results of that choice and offer a new set of options appropriate to the situation. In a therapeutic context the worker and client together can explore the likely consequences of different solutions to a problem and work through to the best solution. Practical use of the program has suggested that this approach is less threatening. An IBM compatible version of OPTECI is currently in progress.},

To the extent that these training courses impact user understanding and motivation, they are important determinants of the user attitudes towards computers and merit serious assessment. Using 327 business undergraduates at two universities in the US, this paper reports on the reactions of students to computers and computer-related tasks before and after an introductory course to computers. Responses to a 20-item scale were analysed to examine the pattern of attitude change experienced by students in their training course. Factor analysis revealed five constructs for describing patterns of computer user attitude: negative reaction to computers; positive reaction to computers; reaction to computers for children education; reaction to computer-mediated services; and reaction to computer games. Four factors show significant change in mean scores after the training courses. The attitudes changed for males more than females, indicating improvement in attitudes. The respondents{\textquoteright} attitude to computer-mediated services remained unchanged. While the directions of changes indicate an overall improvement in respondents{\textquoteright} reactions, many attitudes did not change significantly after having taken the training courses. This may be due to the content or the format of these courses.},

Students displayed a high level of interest that did not diminish over the course of the study as a novelty effect would have predicted, although on-task behavior and indications of intense interest did decline slightly over time. Students were generally equitable and cooperative in their interactions. Almost no gender differences were evident in either motivational or social behavior patterns. Teachers were equitable in their interaction with boys and girls, and they were more likely to interact with low-achieving students than with high achievers. Results suggest that introducing children to microcomputers at this age might reduce the predominance of male computer use and interest that predictably emerge during the elementary school years. },

Subjects performed two trials of a videogame and received money for each point scored. Thirty minutes before commencing each trial, subjects ingested either a solution containing 50 g of G or an identically sweetened and colored placebo. Order of ingestion was partially counterbalanced. Heart rate, the measure of arousal monitored, increased significantly above baseline during each trial, but there was no difference in this rise between trials. The main finding from this experiment was that after ingesting glucose, subjects had a stable blood FFA concentration during the videogame, while after the ingestion of placebo subjects had a significantly higher blood FFA during videogames than they had at baseline. These data suggest that arousal-induced hyperlipidemia can be prevented by pre-event glucose ingestion.},

	abstract = {This article presents evidence for the reliability and construct validity of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Conceptually, apathy is defined as lack of motivation not attributable to diminished level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress. Operationally, the AES treats apathy as a psychological dimension defined by simultaneous deficits in the overt behavioral, cognitive, and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior. Three versions of the AES (clinician, informant, and self-rated) were evaluated for 123 subjects, ages 53-85, meeting research criteria for right or left hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease, major depression, or well elderly control. Multiple forms of reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater) were satisfactory. Several types of validity evidence are presented for each version of the scale, including the following: ability of the AES to discriminate between groups according to mean levels of apathy, discriminability of apathy ratings from standard measures of depression and anxiety, convergent validity between the three versions of the scale, and predictive validity measures derived from observing subjects{\textquoteright} play with novelty toys and videogames. Guidelines for the administration of the AES are presented, along with suggestions for potential applications of the scale to clinical and research questions.},

Although normal A type tympanograms were initially observed, B type tympanograms and a decrease in hearing acuity to a hearing level of 35 dB on both sides was seen when he sniffed with both nostrils pinched (the reverse Valsalva maneuver).  The patient would repeat the action on such occasions as when he wanted to concentrate on playing computer games while his mother was watching TV with the volume up, while he was swimming, or when the surroundings were noisy between lessons at school.  When he wanted to normalize hearing, he would adjust the position of the tympanic membranes by performing the Valsalva maneuver. The patient probably had incomplete closure of the eustachian tube. The eustachian tube could be locked by high negative middle ear pressure induced by the reverse Valsalva maneuver, which resulted in a decrease of hearing acuity caused by retraction of the tympanic membranes bilaterally.},

	abstract = {Computer games have been around for almost as long as computers. Most of these games, however, have been designed in a rather ad hoc manner because many of their basic components have never been adequately defined. In this paper some deficiencies in the standard model of computer games, the minimax model, are pointed out and the issues that a general theory must address are outlined. Most of the discussion is done in the context of control strategies, or sets of criteria for move selection. A survey of control strategies brings together results from two fields: implementations of real games and theoretical predictions derived on simplified game-trees. The interplay between these results suggests a series of open problems that have arisen during the course of both analytic experimentation and practical experience as the basis for a formal theory.

Limited opportunities for exercising self-control while incarcerated may encourage helplessness. If biofeedback training enhances self-regulation skills, then perhaps these behaviors can be taught in confinement. A sample of 12 felonious juvenile residents (aged 15-18) from a highly restricted environment were assigned randomly to a biofeedback or video game group and trained for 10 half-hour sessions. Results indicated virtually no significant differences between biofeedback and video game training. However, pre and post differences for both groups combined demonstrated significant gains in impulsivity, EMG, and self-concept. Both groups rated themselves equally on self-control ability, regardless of training. Further comparisons between other institutionalized residents (N = 14) and staff counselors (N = 10) as non-treatment controls were made. On each measure, both training groups improved consistently and became more like their less restricted counterparts.},

The transfer and adaptation of the motivational and instructional properties of electronic video-game technology have potential for training applications. Skill training includes both effective initial skill achievement and subsequent practice to maintain skill proficiency. Traditional training methods rely heavily on the learning skills and motivation of learners to acquire and maintain competence. Electronic videogames, combining the advantages of gaming and computer-assisted instruction (CAI) principles, may provide effective instructional advantages when incorporated as a mode of instructional delivery. This article examines these advantages, and evaluates the training value of the videogame format.

Studies of the health hazards of video-game playing have linked seizures, psychologic disturbances, and other health problems with the games. The study reported here measured changes in blood pessure and heart rate that occurred in 23 young men when they played a video game. The mean systolic blood pressure for the entire group was considerably higher during play than before or after and was significantly higher in novice players than in more skilled players. Heart rate was also significantly higher during play. In view of these results, other cardiovascular changes might be expected to occur during video-game playing. Although the changes reported here were minor, even minor cardiovascular alterations could potentially prove serious in persons with cardiovascular disease.},

Because repeated-measures designs are virtually universal in environmental studies, the paradigm focuses on stabilization with practice; thus far, over 50 tasks have been studied. The present report describes how five computerized video games fare as performance tests. The tasks were performed for 3 weeks each, in the same order, by the same subjects. The results show that four of the five games meet all criteria satisfactorily and one does not, a favorable showing for the video games in comparison with conventional tests of either the paper-and-pencil or apparatus types. In terms of availability, equipment reliability, expense, and other practical considerations, the video games have many advantages, It is concluded that video games have considerable promise for performance testing and other applied contexts.},
