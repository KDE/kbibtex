To decide which role it should take, each node keeps up a simple invariant in its local neighborhood. This guarantees a global constant factor approximation when the invariant is satisﬁed at all nodes. Due to the changing distances between nodes, invariants can be violated. We show that restoring the invariants is bounded to a constant neighborhood, takes logarithmic (in the number of nodes) asynchronous rounds and affects each node at most twice per violation.",

	abstract = "Using idle times of the processors is a well-known approach to run coarse grained parallel algorithms for extremely complex problems. We present on-line algorithms for scheduling the processes of a parallel application that is known off-line on a dynamic network in which the idle times of the processors are dictated by an adversary. We also take communication and synchronization costs into account. Our first contribution consists of a formal model to restrict the adversary in a reasonable way. We then show a constant factor approximation for the off-line scheduling problem. As this problem has to take communication cost into account, it can be seen as a generalization of many NP-hard parallel machine scheduling problems. Finally, we present on-line algorithms for different models with constant or with nearly constant competitive ratio.",

@inproceedings{DGNR09_online_story_scheduling_in_web_advertising,
	abstract = "We study an online job scheduling problem motivated by \emph{storyboarding} in web advertising, where an advertiser derives value from having uninterrupted sequential access to a user surfing the web. The user ceases to browse with probability $1-\beta$ at each step, independently. Stories (jobs) arrive online; job $s$ has a length $\ell\_s$ and a per-unit value $\v\_s$. We get a value \$\v\_s$ for every unit of the job that we schedule consecutively without interruption, discounted for the time at which it is scheduled. Jobs can be preempted, with no further value derived from the residual unscheduled units of the job. We seek an online algorithm whose total reward is competitive against that of the offline scheduler that knows all jobs in advance. We consider two models based on the maximum delay that can be allowed between the arrival and scheduling of a job. In the first, a job can be scheduled anytime after its arrival; in the second a job is lost unless scheduled immediately upon arrival, pre-empting a currently running job if needed. The two settings correspond to two natural models of how long an advertiser retains interest in a relevant user. We show that there is, in fact, a {\em sharp separation} between what an online scheduler can achieve in these two settings. In the first setting with no deadlines, we give a natural deterministic algorithm with a constant competitive ratio against the offline scheduler. In contrast, we show that in the sharp deadline setting, no (deterministic or randomized) online algorithm can achieve better than a polylogarithmic ratio.",

We focus on a subset of P2P systems, known as "hybrid" P2P, where some functionality is still centralized. (In Napster, for example, indexing is centralized, and file exchange is distributed.) We model a file-sharing application, developing a probabilistic model to describe query behavior and expected query result sizes. We also develop an analytic model to describe system performance. Using experimental data collected from a running, publicly available hybrid P2P system, we validate both models. We then present several hybrid P2P system architectures and evaluate them using our model. We discuss the tradeoffs between the architectures and highlight the effects of key parameter values on system performance.},

	abstract = "We propose a dynamic process for network evolution, aiming at explaining the emergence of the small world phenomenon, i.e., the statistical observation that any pair of individuals are linked by a short chain of acquaintances computable by a simple decentralized routing algorithm, known as greedy routing. Our model is based on the combination of two dynamics: a random walk (spatial) process, and an harmonic forgetting (temporal) process. Both processes reflect natural behaviors of the individuals, viewed as nodes in the network of inter-individual acquaintances. We prove that, in k-dimensional lattices, the combination of these two processes generates long-range links mutually independently distributed as a k-harmonic distribution. We analyze the performances of greedy routing at the stationary regime of our process, and prove that the expected number of steps for routing from any source to any target in any multidimensional lattice is a polylogarithmic function of the distance between the two nodes in the lattice. Up to our knowledge, these results are the first formal proof that navigability in small worlds can emerge from a dynamic process for network evolution. Our dynamica process can find practical applications to the design of spatial gossip and resource location protocols.",

@inproceedings{GJRSST10_distr-graph-linearization,
	abstract = "Topological self-stabilization is an important concept to build robust open distributed systems (such as peer-to-peer systems) where nodes can organize themselves into meaningful network topologies. The goal is to devise distributed algorithms that converge quickly to such a desirable topology, independently of the initial network state. This paper proposes a new model to study the parallel convergence time. Our model sheds light on the achievable parallelism by avoiding bottlenecks of existing models that can yield a distorted picture. As a case study, we consider local graph linearization—i.e., how to build a sorted list of the nodes of a connected graph in a distributed and self-stabilizing manner. We propose two variants of a simple algorithm, and provide an extensive formal analysis of their worst-case and best-case parallel time complexities, as well as their performance under a greedy selection of the actions to be executed.",

A unit disk graph is a graph in which each vertex corresponds to a unit disk in the plane and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their disks have a non-empty intersection. We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum-weight dominating set problem in unit disk graphs, a problem motivated by applications in wireless ad-hoc networks. The algorithm is obtained in two steps: First, the problem is reduced to the problem of covering a set of points located in a small square using a minimum-weight set of unit disks. Then, a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the latter problem is obtained using enumeration and dynamic programming techniques exploiting the geometry of unit disks. Furthermore, we also show how to obtain a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum-weight connected dominating set problem in unit disk graphs.",

@inproceedings{BEKLPR09_SINR_diagrams,
	abstract = "The rules governing the availability and quality of connections in a wireless network are described by physical models such as the signal-to-interference \& noise ratio (SINR) model. For a collection of simultaneously transmitting stations in the plane, it is possible to identify a reception zone for each station, consisting of the points where its transmission is received correctly. The resulting SINR diagram partitions the plane into a reception zone per station and the remaining plane where no station can be heard. SINR diagrams appear to be fundamental to understanding the behavior of wireless networks, and may play a key role in the development of suitable algorithms for such networks, analogous perhaps to the role played by Voronoi diagrams in the study of proximity queries and related issues in computational geometry. So far, however, the properties of SINR diagrams have not been studied systematically, and most algorithmic studies in wireless networking rely on simplified graph-based models such as the unit disk graph (UDG) model, which conveniently abstract away interference-related complications, and make it easier to handle algorithmic issues, but consequently fail to capture accurately some important aspects of wireless networks. The current paper focuses on obtaining some basic understanding of SINR diagrams, their properties and their usability in algorithmic applications. Specifically, based on some algebraic properties of the polynomials defining the reception zones we show that assuming uniform power transmissions, the reception zones are convex and relatively well-rounded. These results are then used to develop an efficient approximation algorithm for a fundamental point location problem in wireless networks.",

Since the size of the representation of an n-point metric space is Θ(n2), the complexity of our algorithm is sublinear with respect to the input size. We consider also the general version of the metric Minimum Facility Location problem and we show that there is no o(n2)-time algorithm, even a randomized one, that approximates the optimal solution to within any factor. This result can be generalized to some related problems, and in particular, the cost of minimum-cost matching, the cost of bi-chromatic matching, or the cost of n/2-median cannot be approximated in o(n2)-time.",

	abstract = "We consider the uncapacitated facility location problem. In this problem, there is a set of locations at which facilities can be built; a fixed cost f i is incurred if a facility is opened at location i. Further- more, there is a set of demand locations to be serviced by the opened facilities; if the demand location j is assigned to a facility at location i, then there is an associated service cost of cij. The objective is to de- termine which facilities to open and an assignment of demand points to the opened facilities, so as to minimize the total cost. We assume that the service costs c ij are symmetric and satisfy the triangle inequality. For this problem we obtain a (1 + 2/e)-approximation algorithm, where 1 + 2/e ≈ 1.736, which is a significant improvement on the previously known approximation guarantees. The algorithm works by rounding an optimal fractional solution to a linear programming relaxation. Our techniques use properties of opti- mal solutions to the linear program, randomized rounding, as well as a generalization of the decomposition techniques of Shmoys, Tardos, and Aardal.",

Unfortunately, existing distributed facility location algorithms are hardly applicable to multi-hop sensor networks. Based on an existing centralized algorithm, we therefore devise equivalent distributed versions which, to our knowledge, represent the first distributed approximations of the facility location problem that can be practicably implemented in multihop sensor networks with local communication. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that, for typical instances derived from sensor-network configuration problems, the algorithms terminate in only few communication rounds, the runtime does not increase with the network size, and, finally, that our implementation requires only local communication confined to small network neighborhoods. In addition, we propose simple extensions to our algorithms to support dynamic networks with varying link qualities and node additions and deletions. Using link quality traces collected from a real sensor network deployment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in realistic multi-hop sensor networks.",

@article{HBF08_kinetic_mobility_mgmt_ad_hoc_nets,
	abstract = "Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a particular category of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) characterized by a high mobility and a reduced connectivity. In order to develop protocols for vehicular networks, the community may either create VANET specific approaches, or adapt already existing protocols to VANET. While the former may provide efficient specialized solutions, the latter offers an increased interoperability and universality, which is a key issue for industrial partners involved in the deployment of VANET and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). An important aspect in the porting of ad hoc networks solutions to VANET and ITS is an efficient management of vehicular mobility. Mobility Management is a principle aimed at updating network routes or structures in order to keep them coherent with mobile topologies. Mobility management may be proactive or reactive, depending if the updates are triggered with or without topology changes, or if and only if a change in the topology effectively requires to update the structure. Failure to develop efficient mobility management heuristics leads to a waste of network resources and suboptimal routes or structures. The optimal solution is obviously the reactive mobility management, as updates are optimally triggered only when necessary. However, due to its complexity, the reactive mobility management has not attracted as much attention as its proactive counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a location-aware framework, called Kinetic Graphs, that may be followed by ad hoc protocols in order to implement a reactive mobility management. The Kinetic Graph framework is able to capture the dynamics of mobile structures, and is composed of four steps: (i) a representation of the trajectories, (ii) a common message format for the posting of these trajectories, (iii) a time varying weight for building the kinetic structures, (iv) an aperiodic neighborhood maintenance. We eventually provide a example of a successful application of this framework to broadcasting and routing in VANET.",

	abstract = "The linear programing algorithms available for optimizing the routing of shipments in multi-plant, multi-destination systems cannot, in the current state of knowledge, be applied directly to the more general problem of determining the number and location of regional warehouses in large-scale distribution networks. This paper outlines a heuristic computer program for locating warehouses and compares it with recently published efforts at solving the problem either by means of simulation or as a variant of linear programing. The heuristic approach outlined in this paper appears to offer significant advantages in the solution of this class of problems in that it (1) provides considerable flexibility in the specification (modeling) of the problem to be solved, (2) can be used to study large-scale problems, that is, complexes with several hundred potential warehouse sites and several thousand shipment destinations, and (3) is economical of computer time. The results obtained in applying the program to small scale problems have been equal to or better than those provided by the alternative methods considered.",

Whereas the k-median problem involves optimizing the simultaneous placement of k facilities, the on-line median problem imposes the following additional constraints: the facilities are placed one at a time; a facility cannot be moved once it is placed, and the total number of facilities to be placed, k, is not known in advance. The objective of an online median algorithm is to minimize the competitive ratio, that is, the worst-case ratio of the cost of an online placement to that of an optimal offline placement. Our main result is a linear-time constant-competitive algorithm for the online median problem. In addition, we present a related, though substantially simpler linear-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for the (metric uncapacitated) facility location problem. The latter algorithm is similar in spirit to the recent primal-dual-based facility location algorithm of Jain and Vazirani, but our approach is more elementary and yields an improved running time.",

@inproceedings{PP09_finding_facilities_fast,
	abstract = "Clustering can play a critical role in increasing the performance and lifetime of wireless networks. The facility location problem is a general abstraction of the clustering problem and this paper presents the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the facility location problem on unit disk graphs (UDGs), a commonly used model for wireless networks. In this version of the problem, connection costs are not metric, i.e., they do not satisfy the triangle inequality, because connecting to a non-neighbor costs ¿. In non-metric settings the best approximation algorithms guarantee an O(logn)-factor approximation, but we are able to use structural properties of UDGs to obtain a constant-factor approximation. Our approach combines ideas from the primal-dual algorithm for facility location due to Jain and Vazirani (JACM, 2001) with recent results on the weighted minimum dominating set problem for UDGs (Huang et al., J. Comb. Opt., 2008). We then show that the facility location problem on UDGs is inherently local and one can solve local subproblems independently and combine the solutions in a simple way to obtain a good solution to the overall problem. This leads to a distributed version of our algorithm in the $\mathcal{LOCAL}$ model that runs in constant rounds and still yields a constant-factor approximation. Even if the UDG is specified without geometry, we are able to combine recent results on maximal independent sets and clique partitioning of UDGs, to obtain an O(logn)-approximation that runs in O(log* n) rounds.",

The robots are anonymous in the sense that they all execute the same algorithm and they cannot be distinguished by their appearances. Initially they do not have a common x-y coordinate system. Such a system can be viewed as a distributed system of anonymous mobile processes in which the processes (i.e., robots) can “communicate” with each other only by means of their moves. In this paper we investigate a number of formation problems of geometric patterns in the plane by the robots. Speciﬁcally, we present algorithms for converging the robots to a single point and moving the robots to a single point in ﬁnite steps. We also characterize the class of geometric patterns that the robots can form in terms of their initial conﬁguration. Some impossibility results are also presented.",

The advice provided to the online algorithm may allow an improvement in its performance, compared to the classical model of complete lack of information regarding the future. We are interested in the impact of such advice on the competitive ratio, and in particular, in the relation between the size b of the advice, measured in terms of bits of information per request, and the (improved) competitive ratio. Since b = 0 corresponds to the classical online model, and b = élog|A| ùb=￼log￼￼￼￼ , where A￼ is the algorithm’s action space, corresponds to the optimal (offline) one, our model spans a spectrum of settings ranging from classical online algorithms to offline ones. In this paper we propose the above model and illustrate its applicability by considering two of the most extensively studied online problems, namely, metrical task systems (MTS) and the k-server problem. For MTS we establish tight (up to constant factors) upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of deterministic and randomized online algorithms with advice for any choice of 1 ≤ b ≤ Θ(logn) , where n is the number of states in the system: we prove that any randomized online algorithm for MTS has competitive ratio Ω( log(n) / b) and we present a deterministic online algorithm for MTS with competitive ratio O (log(n) / b) . For the k-server problem we construct a deterministic online algorithm for general metric spaces with competitive ratio k O (1 / b) for any choice of Θ(1) ≤ b ≤ logk .",

Estimation can be carried out using a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm; this leads to a novel type of NMF algorithm, whose convergence to a stationary point of the IS cost function is guaranteed.

Amortized running time is a realistic but robust complexity measure for which we can obtain surprisingly tight upper and lower bounds on the variety of algorithms. By following the principle of designing algorithms whose amortized complexity is low, we obtain "self-adjusting" data structures that are simple, flexible and efficient. This paper surveys work by several researchers on amortized complexity.},

@inproceedings{ORS07_linearization_locally_self_stab_sorting_in_graphs,
	abstract = "We consider the problem of designing a distributed algorithm that, given an arbitrary connected graph G of nodes with unique labels, converts G into a sorted list of nodes. This algorithm should be as simple as possible and, for scalability, should guarantee a polylogarithmic runtime as well as at most a polylogarithmic increase in the degree of each node during its execution. Furthermore, it should be self-stabilizing, that is, it should be able to eventually construct a sorted list from any state in which the graph is connected. It turns out that satisfying all of these demands at the same time is not easy. Our basic approach towards this goal is the so-called linearization technique: each node v repeatedly does the following with its neighbors: • for its left (i.e., smaller) neighbors u1 , . . . , uk in the or- der of decreasing labels, v replaces {v, u1 }, . . . , {v, uk } by {v, u1 }, {u1 , u2 }, . . . , {uk−1 , uk }, and • for its right (i.e., larger) neighbors w1 , . . . , w in the or- der of increasing labels, v replaces {v, w1 }, . . . , {v, w } by {v, w1 }, {w1 , w2 }, . . . , {w −1 , w }. As shown in this paper, this technique transforms any connected graph into a sorted list, but there are graphs for which this can take a long time. Hence, we propose several extensions of the linearization technique and experimentally evaluate their performance. Our results indicate that some of these have a polylogarithmic performance, so there is hope that there are distributed algorithms that can achieve all of our goals above.",

@article{cooper2009multiple,
	abstract = "We study properties of multiple random walks on a graph under various assumptions of interaction between the particles. To give precise results, we make the analysis for random regular graphs. The cover time of a random walk on a random r-regular graph was studied in [C. Cooper and A. Frieze, SIAM J. Discrete Math., 18 (2005), pp. 728-740], where it was shown with high probability (whp) that for r ≥ 3 the cover time is asymptotic to θrnlnn, where θr = (r - 1)/(r - 2). In this paper we prove the following (whp) results, arising from the study of multiple random walks on a random regular graph G. For k independent walks on G, the cover time C(k) is asymptotic to CG/k, where CG is the cover time of a single walk. For most starting positions, the expected number of steps before any of the walks meet is θrn/(k2). If the walks can communicate when meeting at a vertex, we show that, for most starting positions, the expected time for k walks to broadcast a single piece of information to each other is asymptotic to 21n k/kθrn as k,n → ∞. We also establish properties of walks where there are two types of particles, predator and prey, or where particles interact when they meet at a vertex by coalescing or by annihilating each other. For example, the expected extinction time of k explosive particles (k even) tends to (2ln2) θrn as k → ∞. The case of n coalescing particles, where one particle is initially located at each vertex, corresponds to a voter model defined as follows: Initially each vertex has a distinct opinion, and at each step each vertex changes its opinion to that of a random neighbor. The expected time for a unique opinion to emerge is the same as the expected time for all the particles to coalesce, which is asymptotic to 2θrn. Combining results from the predator-prey and multiple random walk models allows us to compare expected detection times of all prey in the following scenarios: Both the predator and the prey move randomly, the prey moves randomly and the predators stay fixed, and the predators move randomly and the prey stays fixed. In all cases, with k predators and l prey the expected detection time is θrHln/k, where Hl is the lth harmonic number. © 2009 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",

The authors consider the following problem: Suppose two tokens are placed on G, and at each tick of the clock a certain demon decides which of them is to make the next move. The demon is trying to keep the tokens apart as long as possible. What is the expected time M before they meet? The problem arises in the study of self-stabilizing systems, a topic of recent interest in distributed computing. Since previous upper bounds for M were exponential in n, the issue was to obtain a polynomial bound. The authors use a novel potential function argument to show that in the worst case M=(4/27+o(1))n^3.},

We find a fundamental tradeoff between performance and resilience, and show that limiting the degree of nodes is of great importance in controlling this balance. Further, by varying the cost function, the game produces widely different topologies; one parameter in particular - the relative cost between maintaining an overlay link and increasing the path length to other nodes - can generate topologies with node-degree distributions whose tails vary from exponential to power-law. We conclude that competitive games can create overlay routing networks satisfying very diverse goals.",

	abstract = "Given a set of n mobile robots in the d-dimensional Euclidean space, the goal is to let them converge to a single not predefined point. The challenge is that the robots are limited in their capabilities. Robots can, upon activation, compute the positions of all other robots using an individual affine coordinate system. The robots are indistinguishable, oblivious and may have different affine coordinate systems. A very general discrete time model assumes that robots are activated in arbitrary order. Further, the computation of a new target point may happen much earlier than the movement, so that the movement is based on outdated information about other robot’s positions. Time is measured as the number of rounds, where a round ends as soon as each robot has moved at least once. In [6], the Center of Gravity is considered as target function, convergence was proven, and the number of rounds needed for halving the diameter of the convex hull of the robot’s positions was shown to be and ?(n). We present an easy-to-check property of target functions that guarantee convergence and yields upper time bounds. This property intuitively says that when a robot computes a new target point, this point is significantly within the current axes aligned minimal box containing all robots. This property holds, e.g., for the above-mentioned target function, and improves the above to an asymptotically optimal upper bound. Our technique also yields a constant time bound for a target function that requires all robots having identical coordinate axes.",

	abstract = "We study stable marriage and roommates problems in graphs with locality constraints. Each player is a node in a social network and has an incentive to match with other players. The value of a match is specified by an edge weight. Players explore possible matches only based on their current neighborhood. We study convergence of natural better-response dynamics that converge to locally stable matchings – matchings that allow no incentive to deviate with respect to their imposed information structure in the social network. For every starting state we construct in polynomial time a sequence of polynomially many better-response moves to a locally stable matching. However, for a large class of oblivious dynamics including random and concurrent better-response the convergence time turns out to be exponential. In contrast, convergence time becomes polynomial if we allow the players to have a small amount of random memory, even for many-to-many matchings and more general notions of neighborhood.",

	abstract = "We consider network contribution games , where each agent in a social network has a budget of effort that he can contribute to different collaborative projects. Depending on the contribution of the involved agents a project will be successful to a different degree, and to measure the success we use a reward function for each project. Every agent is trying to maximize the reward from all projects that it is involved in. We consider pairwise equilibria of this game and characterize the existence, computational complexity, and quality of equilibrium based on the types of reward functions involved. For example, when all reward functions are concave, we prove that the price of anarchy is at most 2. For convex functions the same only holds under some special but very natural conditions. A special focus of the paper are minimum effort games, where the success of a project depends only on the minimum effort of any of the participants. Finally, we briefly discuss additional aspects like approximate equilibria and convergence of dynamics.",

	abstract = "In this paper we study a variant of the Node-Weighted Steiner Tree problem in which the weights (costs) of vertices are restricted, in the sense that the ratio of the maximum node weight to the minimum node weight is bounded by a quantity α. This problem has applications in multicast routing where the cost of participating routers must be taken into consideration and the network is relatively homogenous in terms of the cost of the routers. We consider both online and offline versions of the problem. For the offline version we show an upper bound of O( min {logα, logk}) on the approximation ratio of deterministic algorithms (where k is the number of terminals). We also prove that the bound is tight unless P=NP. For the online version we show a tight bound of Θ( max { min {α, k}, logk }), which applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms. We also show how to apply (and extend to node-weighted graphs) recent work of Alon et al. so as to obtain a randomized online algorithm with competitive ratio O(logm logk), where m is the number of the edges in the graph, independently of the value of α. All our bounds also hold for the Generalized Node-Weighted Steiner Problem, in which only connectivity between pairs of vertices must be guaranteed.",

We show that for every fixed ε>0, the GROUP-STEINER-TREE problem admits no efficient log2-ε k approximation, where k denotes the number of groups (or, alternatively, the input size), unless NP has quasi polynomial Las-Vegas algorithms. This hardness result holds even for input graphs which are Hierarchically Well-Separated Trees, introduced by Bartal [FOCS, 1996]. For these trees (and also for general trees), our bound is nearly tight with the log-squared approximation currently known. Our results imply that for every fixed ε>0, the DIRECTED-STEINER TREE problem admits no log2-ε n–approximation, where n is the number of vertices in the graph, under the same complexity assumption.",

@inproceedings{GW92_general-approx-technique-for-constrained-forest-problems,
	abstract = "We present a general approximation technique for a large class of graph problems. Our technique mostly applies to problems of covering, at minimum cost, the vertices of a graph with trees, cycles or paths satisfying certain requirements. In particular, many basic combinatorial optimization problems fit in this framework, including the shortest path, minimum spanning tree, minimum-weight perfect matching, traveling salesman and Steiner tree problems. Our technique produces approximation algorithms that run in O(n2 log n) time and come within a factor of 2 of optimal for most of these problems. For instance, we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm for the minimum-weight perfect matching problem under the triangle inequality. Our running time of O(n2 log n) time compares favorably with the best strongly polynomial exact algorithms running in O(n3) time for dense graphs. A similar result is obtained for the 2-matching problem and its variants.We also derive the first approximation algorithms for many NP-complete problems, including the non-fixed point-to-point connection problem, the exact path partitioning problem and complex location-design problems. Moreover, for the prize-collecting traveling salesman or Steiner tree problems, we obtain 2-approximation algorithms, therefore improving the previously best-known performance guarantees of 2.5 and 3, respectively [4].",
