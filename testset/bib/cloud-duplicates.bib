@inproceedings{ieee5623390,
	abstract = {Entities (e.g., users, services) have to authenticate themselves to service providers (SPs) in order to use their services. An entity provides personally identifiable information (PII) that uniquely identifies it to an SP. In the traditional application-centric Identity Management (IDM) model, each application keeps trace of identities of the entities that use it. In cloud computing, entities may have multiple accounts associated with different SPs, or one SP. Sharing PIIs of the same entity across services along with associated attributes can lead to mapping of PIIs to the entity. We propose an entity-centric approach for IDM in the cloud. The approach is based on: (1) active bundles-each including a payload of PII, privacy policies and a virtual machine that enforces the policies and uses a set of protection mechanisms to protect themselves, (2) anonymous identification to mediate interactions between the entity and cloud services using entity's privacy policies. The main characteristics of the approach are: it is independent of third party, gives minimum information to the SP and provides ability to use identity data on untrusted hosts.},

@inproceedings{ieee6122782,
	abstract = {The evolution of cloud computing is driving the next generation of internet services. OpenStack is one of the largest open-source cloud computing middleware development communities. Currently, OpenStack supports platform specific signatures and tokens for user authentication. In this paper, we aim to introduce a cloud platform independent, flexible, and decentralized authentication mechanism, using OpenID as an open-source authentication mechanism in OpenStack. OpenID allows a decentralized framework for user authentication. It has its own advantages for web services, which include improvements in usability and seamless Single-Sign-On experience for the users. This paper presents the OpenlD-Authentication-as-a-Service APIs in OpenStack for front-end GUI servers, and performs the authentication in the back-end at a single Policy Decision Point (PDP). Our implementation allows users to use their OpenID Identifiers from standard OpenTD providers and log into the Dashboard/Django-Nova graphical interface of OpenStack.},
