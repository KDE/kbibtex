abstract = {Discusses the role of the liaison within an academic library's collection development activities in the context of the open systems model of organizations. The open systems view of organizations is an effective model for viewing how a liaison's collection development activities operate within the library and the university. The university forms a larger environment in which the library operates as a smaller organization. Some inputs influencing a library's collection development activities include budget issues, the curriculum itself, faculty research, student interest, human resources, the physical plant, and available technological support. Outputs from the library back to the larger organization include acquisition, organization, and access to information necessary to study and research. Thus, by creating models to show how liaisons fit into the complex and symbiotic relationships of the library, the university, and the larger society, it is possible to create tools to gather and assess information about liaison activities, and then design policies that are both informed by the larger environment while also supporting that environment's needs.

@article{Cheney2004,
abstract = {This article focuses on librarians' role as collaborators and consultants in problem-based learning (PBL), with specific reference to a pilot project organized by Pennsylvania State University in this regard. PBL presents an opportunity for librarians and instructors to collaborate on designing learning experiences that will allow students to acquire information-gathering skills as part of their subject curriculum. The article author describes a pilot project that incorporated PBL in the School of Information Sciences and Technology (IST) First-Year Seminar (FYS) in Pennsylvania. In the fall semester 1999, Larry Spence, director of learning initiatives in Pennsylvania State University's new IST, wanted to develop a model for using PBL teaching methods in the school's newly created FYS. By collaborating on possible exercises and approaches, the article author came to better understand that librarians might over-structure their seminars for several reasons. Instructors and librarians need to demonstrate the process they so much want their students to learn. Instructors who can demonstrate to their students the thinking and questioning process they themselves go through as they seek and read information are providing the best examples of how to use and locate information. This pilot project taught that it is a challenging and rewarding process to teach students how to gather and use information effectively.},

University presses provide an interesting counterpoint, as they form business partnerships and collaborate in professional ways through the Association of American University Presses, but generally understand each other as potential competitors for sales and manuscripts rather than as resource sharers. When two parties begin to explore how to work together, it takes time and effort to establish trust. It is much easier to talk about collaboration and its potential benefits than to actually engage in it. This article looks at several papers exploring the benefits and practicalities of collaborative publishing between research libraries and university presses. Adapted from the source document.},

abstract = {A protocol analysis study was undertaken to explore how a Web-savvy generation of library users searches the online catalog. Eighteen users, including experienced and novice searchers, were recruited. Participants agreed to be recorded and to express their thoughts aloud while searching. Analysis of these data has revealed several distinct trends. Most notable among these trends has been the impact of Internet search engines on user expectations. Given the influence of the Web, these assumptions are likely common throughout higher education. This research reveals where bottlenecks occur and provides insights into how libraries can design systems that help users around trouble spots. (Original abstract)},

abstract = {This study applied traditional categories used for classifying questions presented at reference desks to online reference services. Questions presented at Penn State's subject libraries were classified as 'Where Is,' 'Troubleshooting,' 'Policy and Service,' and 'Reference.' Definitions and examples were provided to the librarians and staff covering thirteen reference desks. These categories were then applied to Penn State's e-mail and chat reference transactions for the Fall 2002 semester. Although the types of questions were similar across the three services, there were differences in the proportion of questions by categories. This suggests that services have similar, yet distinct, functions and that the type of questions submitted differ between in-person and online and also between e-mail and chat.

@article{Cheney2006a,
abstract = {The use and importance of newspaper collections in academic libraries have been in decline as acquisition costs have increased significantly as the difficulty obtaining daily issues in a timely manner has grown, and as newspaper readership has declined nationally. In contrast, today's student and researcher are using television and Internet news sources heavily. This article explores the role of the academic librar'’s news collections in complementing the university's Newspaper Readership Program and supporting faculty efforts to develop their students' critical thinking and media literacy skills. The authors suggest that digital news forms, including television, should be considered and included as part of the library's collections. In this light, lessons can be learned from convergence taking place in the news industry. Libraries must also "converge" news sources to provide library users with news sources, which reflect today's news environment and also reflect the "information cycle." The newly created News Room at Pattee Library incorporates a three-television news viewing area; a broader selection of newspaper titles (particularly international titles); and a news magazine collection, as well as providing access to a wide variety of news aggregator database, and the library's significant historical microfilm collection. A temporary television installation and focus groups were used to help inform the development of the News Room and to determine interest and resistance to sound and televisions in the library. The Libraries' Serials Department provided analysis of newspaper delivery options (and reliability) and related subscription costs, as well as suggestions for reducing the number of missing/nonreceipt issues. In addition, greater focus was placed on niche reference service supporting news sources and news-related research. Use of the News and Microforms Library has increased. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{Furlough2010,
abstract = {Background/Context: The open access movement has successfully drawn attention to economic and political aspects of scholarly communication through a significant body of commentary that debates the merits of open access and the potential damage it may do to scholarly publishing. Researchers within the field of education research, notably John Willinsky, have discussed the value and potential benefits of open access to fulfill the research mission and to improve the visibility of the field. There are now thousands of open access publications or content aggregators online. Researchers have adopted open access to varying degrees, but not as rapidly as proponents have hoped, while readers using traditional discovery services are less likely to encounter open access materials in their research than they are traditionally published scholarship. Purpose: This article examines the opportunities that are available for researchers to adopt open access distribution and the factors that may impede their adoption. I synthesize recent studies of researchers\"{\i}¿1⁄2 attitudes toward, and understanding of, open access and examine the extent to which influential education research journals permit it. I focus on one of the primary methods of adopting open access\"{\i}¿1⁄2archiving versions of articles in open repository services\"{\i}¿1⁄2and demonstrate how that model can contribute to decontextualizing of research findings during discovery. Research Design: This article is based primarily on a literature review and analysis, but also builds on an investigation of publisher policies through publicly accessible Web sites. Conclusions and Recommendations: First, the success of the movement, and the ease with which data can be readily shared by anyone with net access, has contributed to an increasing expectation of \"{\i}¿1⁄2openness\"{\i}¿1⁄2 and will change how research is conducted, shared, and authorized. Second, more research is needed on the attitudes and behavior of researchers in specific fields, especially education researchers, to understand how open access can support their needs as authors. Third, that understanding should be deployed to design services that can help close gaps in the research process. Openness should be adopted as a value in these services, not an end in itself.

However, chat widgets also have far-reaching effects on daily work and organizational culture. Web pages are not the only place chat widgets have found a use in libraries. A great example of service at the point of need is a chat widget appearing after an unsuccessful library catalog search.

In addition, the rate of collaboration has grown. The profile and its related trends were very similar to what has been reported in C\&RL authorship studies-with one exception. Women are more likely to appear as conference presenters than journal authors. Further research should explore the role of gender in scholarly communication. (Author abstract)},

In 2004, eight first-year students received library instruction and were subsequently recruited for the study. Participants were recorded using the online catalog, and a think-aloud protocol was employed to capture students' thoughts. Results were compared with nine first-year students observed in 2002, using the same methodology. Analysis of both groups revealed subtle differences in how they utilized the online catalog. Although these differences cannot be definitively attributed to library instruction, the evidence suggests that instruction can have a positive effect on user search behaviors.

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to seek to explore faculty perceptions versus actual student usage of print and online, full-text articles. Design-methodology-approach - Surveys were given to faculty and their students at four Penn State campuses. Both the six-question instructor survey and the 11-question student survey related to article retrieval for one particular class assignment. Findings - Data gathered from the surveys surprisingly indicated that faculty are overestimating student use of online articles and underestimating their use of print. This study also showed that a majority of students will reject an article that is not available online in full-text. Research limitations-implications - In this study there was a discrepancy between students stating that they knew to cite online sources differently from print sources, and faculty stating that they could tell the percentage of online articles used from their students' bibliographies. In future studies, more of an emphasis would be placed on measuring faculty knowledge of citing online resources. Practical implications - This paper could be used to support the continued purchase of print resources. It could also be used to support the need for faculty to keep current on citing new technological formats and instructing their students on the same. Originality-value - This study was conceived in an attempt to statistically verify not only faculty perceptions of full-text use, but also librarians' perceptions of faculty and student article practices. While a literature search produced several studies on faculty perceptions of internet usage, few were found that touched specifically on full-text articles.},

This period saw an impassioned dialogue over the role of the librarian in the Americanization process, the desirability of collecting materials in non-English languages and the scope of services that should be provided to an expanding population. The Chicago Public Library is examined to see how these issues affected a local library's services and collections. Concludes that the debates of the early twentieth century are not merely historical curiosities.

When updating frequency was compared, new science and social science journal issues appeared in both databases the same week approximately three quarters of the time. In the arts and humanities this is true only about half the time but these data are not as conclusive due to the small sample size. Each database has unique features. Web of Science has superior title coverage, while Current Contents Connect updates faster about 25\% of the time. Unexpected significant problems were noted with updates to Current Contents Connect regarding timing of the updates and the definition of a "current week."

abstract = {The current economic downturn is forcing libraries to slash budgets even as demand for services continues to increase. This scenario is similar to the one that happened during the Great Depression, when library use increased dramatically as millions of jobless patrons searched for career information and sought light reading. Libraries responded by launching large-scale book drives employing community residents and forging new partnerships with state and federal agencies. This article looks at the experiences of the Chicago Public Library during the Great Depression and the valuable lessons that can be learned in terms of maintaining a public service under difficult circumstances.

abstract = {Change in the information environment keeps coming at a rapid pace. Traditional reference statistics are down, electronic resources proliferate, and Google's Book Project is on the march. Despite all this flux, the public service aspect of librarianship remains, at its core, a teaching profession. Whether it is in a one-on-one exchange at the reference desk or a one-to-many session in front of a classroom, librarians are educators. Thus, it seems appropriate to call for library schools to adjust their curricula to reflect the current realities in the daily life of the librarian. In particular, library schools are doing their students and the future employers of those students a disservice by failing to recognize user education as a core competency of today's information professional.

This was achieved by the author, assistant librarian at Pennsylvania State University, who got involved in a semester-long experiment designed to improve the quality of research of freshman students in a speech class. The class is discussion-based, with students giving three speeches during the semester and several mini-speeches. Lecture sessions are rare. This class format proved ideal for the embedded librarian concept. The author was able to be a full participant in the discussions, and his goal was to keep the class thinking about all aspects of information literacy. Adapted from the source document.},

Findings show that the typical core curriculum has grown to include both research and information technology in addition to the more traditional subjects. The number of programs that require a secondary set of required courses (semi-core curriculum) in addition to the primary core curriculum increased. The paper concludes by suggesting that US programs keep a robust general core curriculum while considering the "career-track" model to help students best meet their professional objectives.

@article{Hudson2010,
abstract = {Purpose: - This research aims to present evidence that cultural diversity influences students' desire to utilize library resources and reference services on their mobile devices. Design/methodology/approach - A paper survey was administered voluntarily to undergraduate students to analyze how cultural diversity impacts the types of mobile device-based reference services students desired and how likely they were to access librarians for live research assistance on their mobile devices. Findings - The paper provides evidence that cultural diversity and gender impacts desired mobile device reference services among undergraduate students. White male and African American female students reported a higher likelihood and desire to access librarians for live assistance on their mobile devices. White females indicated, to a large extent, a desire to access e-books and e-magazines on their mobile devices more than any other group. Anecdotally, White females also preferred chat-based reference inside Facebook. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to one campus college location of a Doctoral/Research University Extensive during the fall 2009 semester. Incorporating mobile devices in reference services has yet to fully evolve as an emerging field of study in librarianship. Practical implications - Library and information science professionals will gain valuable insight into how cultural variances impact students' desired engagement with reference librarians, what types of mobile device-based reference services undergraduate students prefer, and what factors influence their mobile device selection process. Originality/value - The paper represents the first study that examines cultural diversity as a determinant in desired mobile device-based reference services among undergraduates. The research also highlights possible directions for future qualitative and quantitative diversity research studies in library and information studies.},

abstract = {The scientific merit of the Ninth ACRL Conference is assessed by tracking the subsequent publication of its presentations. The results indicate that presentations in all formats-papers, panels, posters, and round-tables-achieved publication in refereed journals. Papers and panels were more likely to be published (18\%) than posters and roundtables (8\%). Overall, 13 percent of all presentations became refereed articles. In addition, eight percent of the presentations were based on prior publications. The rate of subsequent publication identified here is similar to that of a previous study of a library conference. However, it is much lower than rates reported for medical and scientific conferences. This may suggest that the ACRL conference resembles a technical, not a scientific, meeting with an emphasis on presenting best practices rather than disseminating research. This study should be replicated to determine if the publication of presentations is higher at other and future library conferences. (Original abstract)},

Thanks to batchloading, previously hidden collections, some costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, are made visible, and library holdings are more accurately reflected by the online catalog. Subject specialists report significant increases in the use of electronic resources and microforms within days (and sometimes only hours) of loading record sets into the online catalog. Managing batchloading projects requires collaboration across many library units, including collection development, acquisitions, cataloging, systems, and public services.
