ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES
AB During space walks, the space suits of astronauts may be contaminated
   by toxic vapors such as hydrazine, which are used for attitude control.
   Here we present some initial results on vapor classification and
   concentration estimation by using Support Vector Machine. (SVM). The
   vapor was collected by electronic nose. By collaborating closely with
   NASA KCS, we achieved great results. For example, for Kam15f
   (90-second) data set, the classification success rate was 97.5% using
   SVM as compared to 87% using the linear discriminant method in [1].
   Comparative studies were conducted between the SVM classifier and other
   classifiers such as Back Propagation (BP) Neural Network, Probability
   Neural Network (PNN), and, Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). In all
   cases, the SVM classifier showed superior performance over other
   classifiers. In the concentration estimation part by using SVM, we
   achieved more than 99% correct estimation of concentration by using the
   90(th) second data samples.

   Exposure to hydrazine and hydrazines' alkylated derivatives is an
   important occupational health issue, which will increase in
   significance as space applications increase. Despite their widespread
   usage as rocket fuels in manned and unmanned space and missile systems,
   serious exposures to hydrazines are rare. While a significant number of
   experimental studies were performed in the late 1950s through the
   mid-1960s, conflicting information exists concerning the most
   appropriate treatment for these exposures. A cross-sectional study
   evaluating the most common rocket fuels such as hydrazine;
   1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH); mono-methylhydrazine (MMH); and
   Aerozine-50 against the most commonly suggested therapies, such as
   pyridoxine, traditional antiseizure therapies, and arginine is needed
   to clarify the treatment implications for human exposure. Treatments
   that have been useful for hyperammonemic states, such as those for the
   six inherited urea cycle defects, have significant potential for the
   improvement of hydrazine exposure treatment.

TI Thermodynamic equations of state for hydrazine and monomethylhydrazine
SO COMBUSTION AND FLAME

DT Article
AB Thermodynamic equations of state are evaluated for the aerospace fuels
   hydrazine and monomethylhydrazine using Peng-Robinson (PR) and
   Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) formulations. The PR formulation is shown to
   be the best fit for hydrazine, and the SRK formulation to be the best
   fit for monomethylhydrazine, based on available critical property data
   and evaluations of thermodynamic consistency. The adequacy of the
   differing property data for these fuels in the literature is discussed,
   and the methodology used to validate the formulations is outlined. The
   importance of using appropriate real fluid equations of state in
   thermodynamic safety and hazards analysis of fuel systems is
   demonstrated by considering an adiabatic compression of gaseous fuels
   previously postulated in accident scenarios of aerospace propulsion
   systems. Calculation of isentropic compression temperatures for pure
   components using ideal gas constant heat capacity, ideal gas with
   variable heat capacity, and real fluid equations of state are compared
   to illustrate the need for real fluid equations of state. In addition,
   three separate approaches are used for estimating isentropic
   compression temperatures for mixtures involving these fuels, again
   illustrating the importance of treating these mixtures as real fluids
   for design and safety analysis. (C) 2002 by The Combustion Institute.

TI Development of an advanced rocket propellant Handler's suit
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Most launch vehicles and satellites in the US inventory rely upon the
   use of hypergolic rocket propollants, many of which are toxic to
   humans. These fuels and oxidizers, such as hydrazine and nitrogen
   tetroxide have threshold limit values as low as 0.01 PPM. It is
   essential to provide space workers handling these agents whole body
   protection as they are universally hazardous not only to the
   respiratory system, but the skin as well. This paper describes a new
   method for powering a whole body protective garment to assure the
   safety of ground servicing crews.
   A new technology has been developed through the small business
   innovative research program at the Kennedy Space Center. Currently,
   liquid air is used in the environmental control unit (ECU) that powers
   the propellant handlers suit (PHE). However, liquid air exhibits
   problems with attitude dependence, oxygen enrichment, and difficulty
   with reliable quantity measurement. The new technology employs the
   storage of the supply air as a supercritical gas. This method of air
   storage overcomes ail of three problems above while maintaining high
   density storage at relatively low vessel pressures (< 7000 kPa or
   similar to 1000 psi). A one hour prototype ECU was developed and tested
   to prove the feasibility of this concept. This was upgraded by the
   design of a larger supercritical dewar capable of holding 7 Kg of air,
   a supply which provides a 2 hour duration to the PHE. A third version
   is being developed to test the feasibility of replacing existing air
   cooling methodology with a liquid cooled garment for relief of heat
   stress in this warm Florida environment.
   Testing of the first one hour prototype yielded data comprobable to the
   liquid air powered predecessor, but enjoyed advantages of attitude
   independence and oxygen level stability. Thermal data revealed heat
   stress relief at least as good as liquid air supplied units.
   The application of supercritical air technology to this whole body
   protective ensemble marked an advancement in the state-of-the-art in
   personal protective equipment. Not only was long duration environmental
   control provided, but it was done without a high pressure vessel. The
   unit met human performance needs for attitude independence, oxygen
   stability, and relief of heat stress. This supercritical air (and
   oxygen) technology is suggested for microgravity applications in life
   support such as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit. (C) 2001 Published by

AB The fragmentation of a Pegasus Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System
   upper stage on 3 June 1996 stands as the worst satellite breakup on
   record in terms of cataloged orbital debris. In addition to the more
   than 700 debris large enough to be tracked (approximately 10 cm in
   diameter or greater) in the 200 km by 2,000 km orbital regime by the
   U.S. Space Surveillance Network, a debris population of up to 300,000
   objects larger than 4 mm appears to have been generated, based upon
   special radar observations. The debris cloud presented an immediate
   threat to many resident space objects, such as the Hubble Space
   Telescope, which resided in an orbit just 25 kin below the breakup
   altitude. Special analyses were required to ensure the safety of the
   STS-82 Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission in February 1997. This
   paper describes the activities undertaken-at the National Aeronautics
   and Space Administration Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center to characterize
   the near-term and far-term hazard of the debris cloud to manned and
   robotic spacecraft and to investigate the probable cause of the
   accident. The role of composite materials in the vehicle may have led
   to the creation of a much larger number of debris than would have been
   expected from a more conventional upper stage. To avoid a repetition of
   the incident, the Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System upper stage was
   modified before its next launch, and additional passivation measures
   were adopted. This fragmentation event represents a textbook case for
   the hazards posed by satellite breakups and how fragmentation potential
   can be reduced without significantly affecting the capability of the
   vehicle. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

   hydrazine arcjet at a mission-average special impulse I,, of greater
   than 600 s, The laboratory-type arcjet thruster was operated at 1800 W
   through a flow rate schedule consistent with a flight application, The
   thruster demonstrated stable, high-efficiency operation for the
   duration of the test, The development effort leading to the
   demonstration addressed the operational and life issues associated with
   achieving high performance, As a result of the development activity, a
   wide range of performance Has also achieved, Performance levels of
   greater than 575 s at 1000 W and greater than 675 s at 2000 W were
   demonstrated. The problems encountered with extending low-power arcjet
   performance are discussed, Increased thruster component temperatures
   caused new life issues to be identified, along with low propellant flow
   rate stability limits, The elevated temperatures caused significant
   changes in the electrode geometry for a thruster based on the
   state-of-the-art tungsten anode designs, Three paths to solving the
   problem were attempted, including lowering the operating temperature
   through improved heat rejection, mechanical design changes to reduce
   thermal stresses, and higher strength materials selection, The success
   of this program provides substantial evidence that an arcjet capable of
   greater than 600-s mission-average specific impulse will be available
   in the near term for night qualification and application.

AB To provide the transportation of lunar base elements to the Moon, large
   high-energy propulsion systems will be required. Advanced propulsion
   systems for lunar missions can provide significant launch mass
   reductions and payload increases. These mass reductions and added
   payload masses can be translated into significant launch cost savings
   for the lunar base missions. In this paper, the masses in low Earth
   orbit (LEO) were compared for several propulsion systems: nitrogen
   tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine (NTO/MMH), oxygen/methane (O2/CH4),
   oxygen/hydrogen (O2/H-2), and metallized O2/H-2/Al propellants. Also,
   the payload mass increases enabled with O2/H-2 and O2/H-2/Al systems
   were addressed. In addition, many system design issues involving the
   engine thrust levels, engine commonality between the transfer vehicle
   and the excursion vehicle, and the number of launches to place the

AB An on-going technology program to improve the performance of low thrust
   chemical rockets for spacecraft on-board propulsion applications is
   reviewed. Improved performance and lifetime is sought by the
   development of new predictive tools to understand the combustion and
   flow physics, introduction of high temperature materials and improved
   component designs to optimize performance, and use of higher
   performance propellants. Improved predictive technology is sought
   through the comparison of both local and global predictions with
   experimental data. Predictions are based on both the RPLUS
   Navier-Stokes code with finite rate kinetics and the JANNAF
   methodology. Data were obtained with laser-based diagnostics along with
   global performance measurements. Results indicate that the modeling of
   the injector and the combustion process needs improvement in these
   codes and flow visualization with a technique such as two-dimensional
   laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) would aid in resolving issues of flow
   symmetry and shear layer combustion processes. High temperature
   material fabrication processes are under development and small rockets
   are being designed, fabricated, and tested using these new materials.
   Rhenium coated with iridium for oxidation protection was produced by
   the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process and enabled an 800 K
   increase in rocket operating temperature. Performance gains with this
   material in rockets using Earth storable propellants (nitrogen
   tetroxide and monomethylhydrazine or hydrazine) were obtained through
   component redesign to eliminate fuel film cooling and its associated
   combustion inefficiency while managing head end thermal soakback.
   Material interdiffusion and oxidation characteristics indicated that
   the requisite lifetimes of tens of hours were available for thruster
   applications. Rockets were designed, fabricated, and tested with
   thrusts of 22, 62, 440 and 550 N. Performance improvements of 10 to 20
   seconds specific impulse were demonstrated. Higher performance
   propellants were evaluated. These propellants, defined as space
   storable propellants, include liquid oxygen (LOX) as.the oxidizer with
   nitrogen hydrides or hydrocarbons as the fuels. Specifically, a
   LOX/hydrazine engine was designed, fabricated, and demonstrated to have
   a 95% theoretical c-star which translates into a projected vacuum
   specific impulse of 345 s at an area ratio of 204:1. Further
   performance improvement can be obtained by the use of LOX/hydrogen
   propellants, especially for manned spacecraft applications, and
   specific designs must be developed and advanced through flight
   qualification.

AB Emission spectroscopy measurements were made of the plasma flow inside
   the nozzle of a 1-kW-class arcjet thruster. The thruster propellant was
   a hydrogen-nitrogen mixture used to simulate fully decomposed
   hydrazine. Several 0.25-mm-diam holes were drilled into the 12-mm-long
   diverging section of the tungsten thruster nozzle to provide side-on
   optical access to the internal flow. Electron excitation for atomic
   species and molecular vibrational and rotational temperatures were
   determined for the expanding plasma using relative line ratio
   techniques. The atomic excitation temperature decreased from 18,000 K
   at a location 3-mm downstream of the constrictor to 9000 K at a
   location 9 mm from the constrictor, while the molecular vibrational and
   rotational temperatures decreased from 6500 to 3000 K and 8000 to 3000
   K, respectively, between the same locations. The electron density,
   measured using H(beta) line Stark broadening, decreased from
   almost-equal-to 10(21) m-3 to 2 x 10(20) m-3 during the expansion in
   the nozzle. The results show that the plasma is in a nonequilibrium
   state throughout most of the nozzle, with relaxation times close to or
   larger than the particle residence time.

AB Hydrazine (HZ) and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) in air were monitored
   continuously using a hand-held ion mobility spectrometer equipped with
   membrane inlet, Ni-63 ion source, acetone reagent gas, and ambient
   temperature drift tube. Response characteristics included detection
   limit, 6 ppb; linear range, 10-600 ppb; saturated response, >2 ppm; and
   stable response after 15-30 min. Ammonia interfered in hydrazines
   detection through a product ion with the same drift time as that for
   MMH and HZ. Acetone reagent gas was replaced with 5-nonanone to alter
   drift times of product ions and separate ammonia from MMH and HZ.
   Patterns in mobility spectra, ion identifications from mass spectra,
   and fragmentation cross-sections from collisional-induced dissociations
   suggest that drift times are governed by ion-cluster equilibria in the
   drift region of the mobility spectrometer. Practical aspects including
   calibration, stability, and reproducibility are reported from the use

TI METALLIZED PROPELLANTS FOR THE HUMAN EXPLORATION OF MARS
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER

AB Advanced chemical propulsion using metallized propellants can enable
   significant launch mass reductions for piloted Mars missions.
   Metallized propellants allow the density and/or the specific impulse
   (I(sp)) of the propulsion system to increase. These density and I(sp)
   increases can reduce the propellant mass and the propulsion system dry
   mass. Both of these effects are discussed and analyzed in the paper.
   Detailed mass scaling equations and estimates of the I(sp) for the
   metallized propellant combinations are presented. The most significant
   savings with metallized propellants are derived from increasing the
   payload delivered to Mars. For the same mass in low Earth orbit (LEO),
   a metallized Mars vehicle can deliver 20-22% additional payload to the
   surface. Using metallized propulsion can accelerate the delivery and
   construction of a Mars base or outpost. This 20% payload increase
   reduces the total number of Mars flights and, therefore, significantly
   reduces the number of space transportation system-cargo (STS-C)
   launches for the entire Mars architecture. Using metallized propellants
   to reduce the mass in LEO per flight is not as effective as increasing
   the payload delivery capacity. While over 20% more payload can be
   delivered to Mars per mission, the mass savings per flight (while
   delivering the same payload with a higher I(sp) system) is much
   smaller. Using metallized propellants in all of the Mars propulsion
   systems, a modest 3.3% LEO mass savings is possible. This translates
   into a savings of 38,000 kg over that required with O2/H2 propulsion.
   The Mars excursion vehicle (MEV) using Earth- or space-storable
   propellants for the ascent can be an alternative to storing cryogenic
   H-2 on Mars. There will be a mass penally for using these alternatives
   because of the lower I(sp) of these systems. A space-storable system
   using oxygen/monomethyl hydrazine/aluminum (O2/MMH/Al) delivered the
   lowest mass penalty over O2/H2. For the expedition case missions, the
   LEO mass penalty for using metallized O2/MMH/Al is only 3-5%.

AB An automated, cyclic life test was performed to demonstrate the
   reliability and endurance of a low-power dc arcjet thruster. Over 1000
   h and 500 on-off cycles were accumulated, which would represent the
   requirements for about 15 years of on-orbit lifetime. A
   hydrogen/nitrogen propellant mixture was used to simulate decomposed
   hydrazine propellant, and the power level was nominally 1.2 kW after
   the burn-in period. The arcjet operated in a very repeatable fashion
   from cycle to cycle. The steady-state voltage increased by
   approximately 6 V over the first 300 h, and then by only 3 V through
   the remainder of the test. Thrust measurements taken before, during,
   and after the test verified that the thruster performed in a consistent
   fashion throughout the test at a specific impulse of 450-460 s.
   Post-test component evaluation revealed limited erosion on both the
   anode and cathode. Other thruster components, including graphite seals,
   appeared undamaged.

AB Air oxidation of hydrazine was studied by using a group of kaolinites,
   halloysites, and substituent oxides as models for the tetrahedral and
   octahedral sheets.  The rate was found to be linear with oxygen.  The
   stoichiometry showed that oxygen was the primary oxidant and that
   dinitrogen was the only important nitrogen-containing product.  The
   rates on kaolinites were strongly inhibited by water.  Those on
   three-dimensional silica and gibbsite appeared not to be. That on a
   supposedly layered silica formed from a natural kaolinite by acid
   leaching showed transitional behavior - slowed relative to that
   expected from a second-order reaction relative to that on the gibbsite
   and silica but faster than those on the kaolinites. The most striking
   result of the reaction was the marked increase in the rate of reaction
   of a constant amount of hydrazine as the amount of clay was increased.
   This increase was apparent (in spite of the water inhibition at high
   conversions) over a 2 order of magnitude variation of the clay weight.
   The weight dependence was taken to indicate that the role of the clay
   is very important, that the number of reactive centers is very small,
   or that they may be deactivated over the course of the reaction. In
   contrast to the strong dependence on overall amount of clay, the
   variation of amounts of putative oxidizing centers, such as structural
   Fe(III), admixed TiO2 or Fe2O3, or O- centers, did not result in
   alteration of the rate commensurate with the degree of variation of the
   entity in question. Surface iron does play some role, however, as
   samples that were pretreated with a reducing agent were less active as
   catalysts than the parent material. These results were taken to
   indicate either that the various centers interact to such a degree that
   they cannot be considered independently or that the reaction might
   proceed by way of surface complexation, rather than single electron
   transfers.

AB The rates (previously reported) for the air oxidation of hydrazine on
   kaolinite and substituent oxides of kaolinite showed a complex
   dependence on the relative amounts of several structural
   oxidizing/reducing entities within the reaction-promoting solids. The
   rates indicated an important role of the clay but no dominant role of
   any one of the oxidizing/reducing entities. In this paper we review (a)
   the reaction-promoting activity of these centers as studied in other
   systems, (b) various spectroscopic results showing interaction between
   these entities in clays and (c) reported spectroscopic studies ot the
   complexation between hydrazine and aluminosilicate surfaces as a whole,
   in an effort to propose a mechanism for the reaction.  Whereas some
   uncertainties remain, the present synthesis concludes that a mechanism
   operating through single electron/hole transfers and hydrogen atom
   transfers by discrete centers is adequate to explain the observed rate
   behaviors including the observed second order dependence of the
   oxidation rate on catalyst amount. The effects of these operations on
   the catalyst can result in no alteration of, or complete or partial
   electronic relaxation of its contingent of trapped separated charge
   pairs. The degree to which surface complexation as a whole,
   intercalation, or luminescent processes may also be associated with the
   reaction cannot be adequately assessed with the information in hand.

DT Article
AB Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of fuel hydrazines adsorbed on silica,
   silica-alumina, alumina and ferric oxide surfaces indicates that the
   primary surface-hydrazine interaction is hydrogen bonding.  Hydrazine,
   on adsorption to a deuterated silica surface, undergoes a rapid H/D
   exchange with deuterated surface silanol (Si-OD) groups.  Adsorption
   equilibria are rapidly established at room temperature. 
   Monomethylhydrazine and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine are similarly adsorbed. 
   On adsorption, the C-H stretching and methyl deformation modes of the
   methylhydrazines are shifted to higher frequencies by 10-20 cm-1. 
   These shifts are postulated to be due to changes in the lone-pair
   electron-density on the adjacent nitrogen-atom.  From a linear
   relationship of the electronegativities and deformation frequencies it
   is estimated that adsorption results in a 5% increase in
   electronegativity of the H-bonded atom.
