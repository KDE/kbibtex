AB In reproductive tissues such as the breast and the uterus, cell
   proliferation and differentiation is strongly regulated by complex
   interactions between estrogen receptor a (ER alpha) and growth factor
   receptors. In the present study, we investigated the potential
   occurrence of such cross-talk in the murine, gonadotropic alpha T3-I
   cell line, which expresses ER alpha and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR).
   Under estrogen-free conditions, basal cell proliferation and
   ER-mediated gene transcription was strongly inhibited by the selective
   estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OH-Tam) and
   by the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI). These effects can be
   reversed by either 17-beta-estradiol (E-2) or insulin-like growth
   factor I (IGF-1), both exerting modest mitogenic effects in the alpha
   T3-1 cell line. Furthermore, IGF-I enhanced both basal and E-2-induced
   ER-driven gene transcription. This may be explained, at least in part,
   by enhanced phosphorylation of ER alpha atserine 118, a prerequisite
   for the transactivation capacity of the receptor. Finally, the
   IGF-l-induced response on cell growth and ER-mediated transactivation
   can be inhibited with either ICI or 4-CH-Tam. In conclusion, our data
   indicate IGF-IR and ER interactions in the aT3-1 cell line, an in vitro
   model for the pituitary gonadotrophs, hereby suggesting a role of IGF-I
   in the regulation of gonaclotropin synthesis and secretion.
