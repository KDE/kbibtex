TI Evaluation of gambir quality based on quantitative analysis of
   polyphenolic constituents

AB Gambir (asen'yaku in Japanese), an aqueous extract of leaves and young
   twigs of Uncaria gambir Roxb., has traditionally been used as a
   treatment for diarrhea and dysentery as an internal medicine and for
   sore throat as a gargle. Although it is a pharmacopoeic medicine in
   Japan, the quantitative evaluation of its constituents has not yet been
   adopted in the Japanese pharmacopoeia. We analyzed polyphenolic
   constituents in 31 gambir and related products to establish evaluation
   methods, since gambir contains large amounts of polyphenolic
   constituents. The total flavan contents in the samples revealed using
   the vanillin-HCl estimation method ranged from 24-79%. Reversed-phase
   high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis indicated
   that catechin was the most abundant constituent in each sample, with
   contents in the range of 7-76%. The catechin contents in the gambir
   products between the first and third quartiles were 28-54%. Thus, the
   lower limit of the catechin content in gambir products can be set at
   around 20% for quality management. Fifteen tested samples were
   subjected to HPLC analysis to show the presence of epicatechin (1.5% on
   average) and the dimeric compounds procyanidin B1, procyanidin B3, and
   gambiriin A1 (ca. 1 % each). The molecular weight distributions of
   polymeric flavans in the gambir products were analyzed by gel
   permeation chromatography (GPC) and showed that the average degree of
   polymerization for each sample was 3 to 7. These results indicate that
   the combination of the vanillin-HCl method, RP-HPLC analysis, and GPC
   analysis gives valuable information for evaluating the polyphenolic
   profiles of gambir products.

AB There is a lack of intricate research into the relationships between
   work performance and other variables. This study examined the causal
   relationship between work, non-work stressors, and work performance.
   Using longitudinal multi-group data from three groups - university
   staff, trainee nurses, and part-time employees (overall N=244) -
   structural equation modelling was employed to explore one-way and
   reverse competing models. The results produced a good fitting model
   with one-way causal paths from work-related and non-work stressors
   (time 1) to job performance (time 2). Nested model comparison analysis
   provided further evidence to support this best fitting model,
   emphasizing the strong influence that non-work factors have within the
   workplace. This study has important implications for theory,
   methodology and statistical analysis, and practice in the field of
   work-related stressors and performance.

AB Workplace accidents and violence are both potential sources of employee
   injuries that have been dealt with in entirely separate literatures. In
   this study we adapted the concept of safety climate from the
   accident/injury literature to violence in developing the concept of
   perceived. violence climate. A scale was developed to assess perceived
   violence climate, including items about management attention, concern,
   and policies designed to keep employees safe from violence. Data were
   collected from a sample of 198 nurses from a US Hospital. Perceived
   violence climate was found to correlate significantly with both
   physical violence and verbal aggression experienced by the nurses,
   injury from violence, and perceptions of workplace danger. Furthermore,
   regression analyses showed that climate explained additional variance
   in psychological strain and perceptions of danger over experienced
   violence. These results have implications for interventions aimed at
   producing a good perceived violence climate in order to reduce the
   incidence of violence and aggression within an organization.

AB Funnel-and-gate systems ( FGSs), which constitute a common variant of
   permeable reactive barriers used for in situ treatment of groundwater,
   pose particular challenges to the task of design optimization. Because
   of the complex interplay of funnels and gates, the evolutionary
   algorithms applied have to cope with multimodality, nonseparability,
   and nonlinearity of the optimization task. We analyze these features in
   a test case, introducing an objective function for design cost and
   constraints to account for plume capture and detention time in the gate
   reactors. We show that the derandomized evolution strategy with
   covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES) does solve the given design
   optimization problem with high success rates. We further examine the
   performance of the algorithm for the example of four-gate systems in
   three heterogeneous template aquifers. Here a special focus is set on
   the parameterization of the FGS (i.e., the problem encoding). The
   comparison of three different encodings reveals their significance
   concerning the search progress and its success. Among the found optimal
   and near-optimal design solutions, mutual patterns were recognized. In
   particular, a large central barrier seems to be a superior feature.

AB Given the diversity of nutritional background of beef cattle, the more
   information the nutritionist can acquire, the better the nutritional
   management programs during the finishing period can be developed. Some
   factors that should be accounted for include weaning status and
   previous growing treatments. Working cattle up on feed and bunk
   management continue to be a challenge for nutritional consultants. Use
   of anabolic implants continues to be one of the most effective
   management programs; however carcass quality may be affected with some
   implants.

AB Mortality from digestive diseases in feedlot cattle is second only to
   that from respiratory diseases. Acidosis is a major digestive disorder
   and is likely to continue because of ongoing attempts to improve the
   efficiency of beef production by feeding more grain and less roughage.
   Subacute acidosis is the most prevalent form of acidosis in feedlots
   but is difficult to diagnose because of the absence of overt clinical
   signs. Control of acidosis is achieved largely by sound nutritional
   management. No single strategy or solution exists; however, an
   effective management strategy should factor in dietary formulation, a
   consistent feeding program, prudent bunk management, use of nonstarch
   by-products, and feed additives to minimize pen-to-pen and
   animal-to-animal variations in feed intake.

AB Liver abscesses in feedlot cattle result from aggressive grain-feeding
   programs and are influenced by a number of dietary and management
   factors. They have a major economic impact on the feedlot industry
   because of liver condemnation and reduced animal performance and
   carcass yield. Ruminal lesions resulting from acidosis usually are
   accepted as the predisposing factors. Generally, control of liver
   abscesses in feedlot cattle has depended on the use of tylosin, which
   reduces abscess incidence by 40% to 70%. However, new methods and
   products for liver abscess control are needed. Corn milling by-products
   that are less fermentable may aide in the quest for cattle production
   techniques that lead to lower usage of antimicrobials. A vaccine is
   also commercially available.

AB A two-year longitudinal study was conducted to assess the reproductive
   and lactation performances of smallholder crossbred dairy cattle in
   Fitche, central Ethiopia. Twenty-four smallholder dairy farms were
   monitored and data on reproductive, breeding, lactation and management
   aspects of crossbred dairy cows (n=69) were collected and analysed.
   Moreover, milk samples were collected and analysed for progesterone.
   The overall Least-squares means for calving interval (CI), calving to
   conception interval (CCI) and first observed oestrus after calving were
   516, 253 and 141 days, respectively. Suckling significantly prolonged
   these intervals. The mean first onset of luteal activity (OLA) after
   calving was 52 days, while 67.4% (n=43) had a delayed (> 55 days)
   return to cyclicity after calving. Suckling and parity number
   significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the OLA. The mean lactation length
   was 54.4 weeks. The overall daily mean milk yield for the first 43
   weeks of lactation after calving was 11.7 L/day. The estimated daily
   milk yield increased slowly and reached peak (13.8 L/day) around the
   11th week post partum and declined gradually and steadily. Suckling
   status, season of calving and parity number significantly influenced
   the estimated daily milk yield. In conclusion, the present study
   indicated that the smallholder crossbred dairy cows in the study area
   had prolonged intervals to first oestrus after calving, to conception
   and to the next calving, and thus their reproductive performance is
   unsatisfactory. Delayed first onset of luteal activity (postpartum
   anoestrus) contributed to these extended intervals. Further detailed
   investigation is suggested to examine the effects of other relevant
   factors on the reproductive and lactation performances of smallholder
   crossbred dairy cows for appropriate intervention.

ID FOIL AIR BEARINGS; JOURNAL BEARINGS; PERFORMANCE
AB Tests were performed to evaluate three different methods of utilizing
   air to provide thermal management control for compliant journal foil
   air bearings. The effectiveness of the methods was based on bearing
   bulk temperature and axial thermal gradient reductions during air
   delivery. The first method utilized direct impingement of air on the
   inner surface of a hollow test journal during operation. The second,
   less indirect method achieved heat removal by blowing air inside the
   test journal parallel to the shaft axis to simulate air flowing axially
   through a hollow shaft. The third method emulated the most common
   approach to removing heat by forcing air axially through the bearing's
   support structure. Internal bearing temperatures were measured with
   three type K thermocouples embedded in the bearing that measured
   general internal temperatures and axial thermal gradients. Testing was
   performed in a 1 atm, 260 degrees C ambient environment with the
   bearing operating at 60 krpm, and supporting a load of 222 N. Air
   volumetric flows of 0.06, 0.11, and 0.17 m(3)/min at approximately 150
   to 200 degrees C were used. The tests indicate that all three methods
   provide thermal management but at different levels of effectiveness.
   Axial cooling of the bearing support strucure had a greater effect on
   the bulk temperature for each air flow and demonstrated that the
   thermal gradients could be influenced by the directionality of the
   airflow. Direct air impingement on the journal's inside surface
   provided uniform reductions in both bulk temperature and thermal
   gradients. Similar to the direct method, indirect journal cooling had a
   uniform cooling effect on both bulk temperatures and thermal gradients
   but was the least effective of the three methods.

ID BALANCED SCORECARD
AB This study examines performance evaluation measures across private
   sector companies in an Egyptian context and pinpoints obstacles that
   may limit the adoption of the balanced scorecard (BSC). The analysis of
   survey results reveals that companies rely on both financial and
   non-financial measures of performance evaluation. The profit margin, as
   a financial measure, is the most commonly used performance measure.
   Customer satisfaction is the most commonly used non-financial measure
   of performance evaluation. The BSC has wide-spread use in Egyptian
   companies but the level of use of multi-dimensional indicators is
   significantly low. The survey provides considerable insight into
   obstacles inhibiting the adoption of the balanced scorecard. The most
   significant obstacle is the inadequacy of implemented information
   systems.

AB Workers sometimes violate, more or less deliberately, Quality
   Management System ( QMS) procedures and rules, and two of the most
   essential causes of such violations are the attitude and motivation of
   the workers. The effectiveness of a QMS may therefore benefit from
   management tools aimed at promoting desired behaviour. The result could
   then be a behaviour-oriented frame for the QMS. The concept of
   individual accountability, a pivotal concept in performance management
   models, may serve to develop such a frame. In this study, the
   relationship between individual accountability factors and the
   effectiveness of a QMS is investigated. Individual accountability is
   conceived of as the interplay among three factors: system clarity,
   social support and personalized responsibility. Data were obtained by
   conducting a survey and by interviewing employees of a large gas
   company. We found positive relationships between all three
   accountability factors and belief in the QMS as well as use of the QMS.
   Personalized responsibility and social support appeared to strengthen
   the relationship between system clarity and belief in the QMS, whereas
   the same factors appeared to weaken the relationship between system
   clarity and use of the QMS. Apart from being motivators in themselves,
   the three accountability factors thus seem to form a system of
   interrelated factors.

AB In competitive consumer markets, building and maintaining a good
   relationship with customers is essential to long- term business
   survival. Currently, firms are applying Customer Relationship
   Management ( CRM) to facilitate the maintenance of this relationship.
   This investigation applies interview survey methods to explore the
   relationship between Business Process Reengineering ( BPR),
   Organizational Learning, Relationship Quality, and Organizational
   Performance in the implementation of a CRM system. Among these factors,
   BPR and Organizational Learning are the first steps in the construction
   of CRM. BPR involves staff reward and training, organizational
   structure, and information technology tools. Organizational learning
   involves commitment to learning, shared visions and open- mindedness.
   Relationship Quality involves trust, satisfaction and commitment, which
   are intended to be increased by the implementation. The Balanced
   Scorecard approach is applied to the measurement of Organizational
   Performance, involving the internal business process, learning and
   growth, customer, and financial performance perspectives. Overall, the
   study supports the proposition relationship between the four
   perspectives. The actual implementation of CRM is believed by the
   respondents to contribute to an improvement in relationship quality and
   organizational performance, and the consensus is that implementation of
   a CRM system should be preceded by BPR and organizational learning.

AB This research on Total Quality Management ( TQM) investigates the
   essences and processes of TQM implementation and its effects on
   organisation performance. In particular, it reports the results of a
   questionnaire survey of TQM practices in Chinese companies. The
   research identifies a series of concepts under TQM and the significant
   benefits it can bring to organisations to help them continuously
   improve, not only in product or service quality but also in integrated
   company management. The results from the questionnaire indicate that
   the adoption of TQM in China is extensive, and the majority of the
   expected benefits in the literature have been delivered to these
   Chinese companies. In addition, the questionnaire also includes two
   comparisons of organisation performance: one is between companies with
   and without TQM; the other is among TQM companies. The findings provide
   evidence that TQM can positively impact firm performance depending on
   the degree of implementation.

AB The relationship between customer satisfaction and economic returns has
   received growing attention in the customer satisfaction literature.
   However, there has been limited work linking customer satisfaction to
   customer profitability. Specifically, most empirical studies conduct
   firm- wide or business- level tests, but few investigate if individual
   customers' satisfaction with products or services drives their purchase
   intentions and economic contributions to the firm. Using panel data
   from 36 retail branch banks managed by an international financial
   institution ( RBANK), which consists of two customer satisfaction data-
   points over nine months and monthly-activity based customer
   profitability data, this study examines how individual customers'
   satisfaction impacts customer revenue, customer costs, and customer
   profitability. The results indicate that several dimensions of customer
   satisfaction are positively associated with individual customers'
   repurchase intentions and firm reputation. The effect of the
   responsiveness dimension dominates the effect of other dimensions in
   most tests. At RBANK, individual- level customer revenue and costs both
   increase as customer satisfaction improves, but no significant relation
   exists between customer satisfaction and customer profitability. These
   findings shed light on several management issues, such as market
   segmentation, customer retention, and the implementation of a balanced
   scorecard. Furthermore, this study highlights a way for managers to
   analyze customer value, which is beneficial for long- term customer
   relationship management.

AB Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate a new automated assay
   for D-dimer testing (AxSYM D-Dimer) based on microparticle
   enzyme-immunoassay technology by comparing it with three well
   established D-dimer assays.
   Patients and methods: The performance of the new assay was evaluated in
   280 plasma samples that were collected prospectively from out-patients
   included in a management study evaluating a decision based algorithm.
   Results: 58/280 patients (21%) had PE diagnosed by CT Median values of
   AxSYM D-dimer in patients with PE were 3689 ng/mL (range 775-9000).
   Comparison analysis displayed excellent agreement with VIDAS
   (kappa=0.84) and Asserachrom (kappa=0.81) D-dimer assays. A strong
   correlation was found between AxSYM and the VIDAS (r=0.96) and
   Asserachrom (r=0.89) D-dimer assays. The highest cut-off value for
   AxSYM that yielded a sensitivity of 100% was 765 ng/mL with a
   specificity of 50%. At the cut-off level < 500 ng/mL, the sensitivity
   and specificity of AxSYM D-dimer were 100% and 34%; VIDAS 100% and 42%;
   Asserachrom 100% and 40%; and STALiatest 100% and 37%, respectively.
   AxSYM D-dimer was negative in 75 patients (33.8%). None of these had PE
   at the initial work-up or VTE during the 3-month follow-up.
   Conclusions: AxSYM D-dimer seems to be safe and effective in ruling out
   PE in outpatients. The cut-off level can be set at 500 to 750 ng/mL, at
   which the assay displays a performance that is comparable to that of
   the ELISA based assays. However, further studies are needed to confirm
   the safety of the assay and to determine the most optimal cut-off level
   in patients with venous thromboembolism. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier

AB D-dimer is an indicator for in vivo fibrin formation, reflecting the
   formation of fibrin crosslinked by factor XIIIa. D-dimer assays are
   frequently used in emergency situations, such as diagnosis of venous
   thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, or disseminated intravascular
   coagulation. In these conditions, short sample turnaround times are
   essential. The PATHFAST D-dimer assay allows rapid quantitative
   measurement of D-dimer in plasma and whole blood. The study shows an
   excellent correlation between whole blood and plasma measurement of
   D-dimer both in the high range, as well as in the normal range.
   Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were below
   10%. The upper limit of normal (ULN=mean value measured in 100 samples
   from healthy blood donors+2xS.D.) was approximately 1 mu g/ml FEU,
   using the assay-specific calibration. The maximal value measured in 20
   replicates of calibrator 1 containing no D-dimer antigen was 0.00052 mu
   g/ml FEU, and this 10-fold lower than the declared detection limit of
   0.005 mu g/ml FEU. In conclusion, the PATHFAST D-dimer assay is the
   first automated fully quantitative D-dimer assay, which can use plasma
   and whole blood as sample materials in parallel. (c) 2006 Published by

AB Degradation of soils by irrigation with ground waters containing
   residual alkalinity poses a major threat to agriculture in semi-arid
   regions, particularly in South Asia. However, there is a lack of
   indices to define the soil degradation and crop performance under a
   monsoon climate. Therefore, an experiment was conducted during
   2000-2004 to determine the responses of paddy rice and wheat crops in
   rotation to irrigation with alkaline waters (AW) having similar
   salinity (electrolyte concentration 30 me L-1) but varying ionic
   constituents (sodium adsorption ratio irrigation water, SARiw 10 and
   25; adjusted sodium adsorption ratio, adj.R-Na 13.6 and 29.2; residual
   sodium carbonate, RSC 5 and 10 me L-1 and Cl:SO4 4:1 and 1:4,
   respectively). The concentration factors, ECe/ECiw (ratio of electrical
   conductivity of soil's saturation paste extract to that of the
   irrigation water) were between 1.1 and 1.8 for soils deprived of
   rainfall, whereas it was almost 1 for soils not sheltered from rain.
   Similarly, saturation paste extract, SARe, was between 1.6 and 2.0
   times SARiw and 2.0-2.3 times SARiw with and without rainfall, and the
   exchangeable sodium per cent (ESP) 1.0-1.8 times SARiw. Yields of paddy
   relative to yields of crops irrigated with good-quality water, averaged
   56-74% during the period 2000-2004 compared with 81-88% for wheat,
   indicating the greater sensitivity of rice to irrigation with AW.
   Elevated levels of sulphate rather than chloride in the irrigation
   water lessened the impacts of the residual alkalinity. Production
   functions showed that the sodicity (ESP) did not solely explain the
   variation in crop yields because the salinity stress simultaneously
   inhibited growth. None of the sodicity indices (RSC, SAR and adj.R-Na)
   adequately defined the relative impacts of AW, although residual
   alkalinity (RSC) was a better indicator than either of the other two.
   The monsoon rains played an important role in alleviating the effects
   of residual alkalinity. Data presented here should support the
   development of more reliable criteria for the assessment of
   sodicity/salinity hazards from AW in semi-arid regions.

AB Wrist arthroscopy has become an indispensable tool for the surgeon
   treating internal derangement of the wrist. The role of arthroscopy in
   both the diagnosis and treatment of intrinsic ligaments and triangular
   fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) pathology is well established.
   Arthroscopy remains a surgical procedure with potential complications,
   and it does not obviate the need for a careful history, physical
   examination, and conventional radiography. When the diagnosis remains
   unclear after these initial investigations, cross-sectional imaging
   studies play a valuable role in the assessment of internal derangement
   of the wrist. These studies include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
   magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA), and computed tomography
   arthrography (CTA), the choice of which depends on the specific
   clinical query. The radiologist must have exact knowledge of the
   performance of each diagnostic test to select the appropriate one and
   interpret it in a clinically relevant manner. With continued
   refinements in the technological aspects of cross-sectional imaging,
   its potential to replace diagnostic arthroscopy will surely be realized
   in the near future. This article focuses on the role of cross-sectional
   imaging and arthroscopy in the evaluation and management of wrist
   internal derangement, namely of intrinsic ligaments and TFCC pathology.

AB This paper describes the development and application of a multi-channel
   monitoring system for recording, processing, and analyzing volatile
   organic compound (VOC) levels discharged to the atmosphere from a
   walk-in hood in a hazardous waste management facility. The monitoring
   system consists of an array of PID (photo ionization detector) sensors
   and a networked control program that provides operational schematic
   diagram, performs data analyses, and illustrates real-time graphical
   displays. Furthermore, the system records potential worker exposures,
   exhaust filtration efficiency and environmental release levels.
   Multi-channel continuous monitoring of VOCs is successfully implemented
   during chemical bulking operations. It is shown that a real-time
   monitoring system is effective for early warning detection of hazardous
   chemicals and for predicting the performance of adsorption filters used
   for VOC removal. In addition, a connected local weather visualization
   system supports efforts to minimize potential health and environmental
   impacts of VOC emissions to surrounding areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the objective to evaluate the inclusion of spray dry blood plasma
   in diets for piglets weaned at 21 days of age (5.9 +/- 0.40 kg initial
   BW), a total of 112 animals were allotted to completely randomize block
   design with four treatment and seven replications with four animals per
   experimental unit, in three subsequent periods: from 21 to 28 days
   (period 1), from 29 to 35days (period 2), from 36 to 42 days (period
   3). The piglets were maintained in the experiment from 43 to 56 days
   (period 4) fed conventional nurse diet. The treatments consisted of
   inclusion levels of 0.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0% of spray dry blood plasma
   in the period 1, 0.0; 2.8; 4.2 and 5.6% in the period 2 and 0.0; 2.0;
   3.0 and 4.0% in the period 3. The average daily weight gain (ADWG)
   increased in a quadratic form up to the estimate inclusion levels of
   4.3, 2.5 and 1.3 of spray dry blood plasma in the diet, in the periods
   1, 2 and 3, respectively. No significant effect was observed for the
   inclusion levels of spray dry blood plasma on daily feed intake and
   ADWG in the period 4. The inclusion levels of spray dry blood plasma in
   diets for pigs weaned at 21 days of age should be 4.3 for the first
   week, 2.5 for the second and 1.3% for the third week post weaning.

AB There is evidence that the reproductive performance of dairy cows has
   declined as milk yields have increased over the last 40 years.
   Identifying the precise cause(s) of this problem may provide focused
   solutions. Intensive genetic selection for very high yields has reduced
   fertility, due mainly to an increase in postpartum clinical problems,
   poor expression of oestrus, defective oocytes/embryos and uterine
   infections. It is a challenge to solve the problem by getting enough
   food into these cows to meet the high demands of peak milk yields in
   early lactation, as well as providing the considerable veterinary
   attention required in the early period after calving. Both these
   aspects also pose welfare issues. A better solution would be to make
   genetic and management changes to increase the persistency of
   lactations to reduce the number and intensity of clinical risk periods
   throughout a cow's life without compromising milk output.

AB Over the last few decades, rhinoceroses and elephants became important
   icons in the saga of wildlife conservation. Recent surveys estimate the
   wild Asian (Elephas maximus) and African (Loxodonta africana) elephant
   populations to be, at most, 50 250 and 637 600 respectively. For the
   five rhinoceros species, black (Diceros bicornis), white (Ceratotherium
   simum), Indian (Rhinoceros unicornis), Javan (Rhinoceros sondaicus) and
   Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis), the population
   estimates of 3610, 11 330, 2400, 60 and 300, respectively, are of even
   greater concern. Protected against habitat loss, poaching and left
   undisturbed, rhinoceros and elephants reproduce well in the wild. But
   small and decreasing populations make successful captive management of
   these taxa increasingly important. In captivity, however, most
   populations face possible 'extinction' because of historically poor
   reproductive performance. From the first descriptions of the
   reproductive anatomy and the oestrous cycle (Laws 1969; Kassam and
   Lasley 1981; Balke et al. 1988a, b; Plotka et al. 1988; Godfrey et al.
   1991) to the present use of advanced assisted reproduction
   technologies, researchers have strive to understand the function and
   dysfunction of the reproductive biology of these charismatic species.
   This paper reviewed the current knowledge on rhinoceros and elephant
   reproduction biology, reproductive cycle, gestation, dystocia,
   reproductive pathology, oestrous induction and artificial insemination,
   sperm sexing, IVF and contraception, and how this knowledge is or might
   be used to aid species conservation for maximal reproductive efficiency
   and enhancement of genetic management.

AB This article is an examination of the effects of network involvement,
   or structural embeddedness, on three organizationally based social
   outcomes. Specifically, we argue that in centralized, publicly funded
   networks an organization's structural embeddedness will be related to
   its trustworthiness, reputation and influence, as rated by other
   network members. Results from a network survey of a publicly funded
   health and human service network generally confirm our hypotheses and
   suggest additional work on the topic,

TI Malaysia as model - Policy transferability in an Asian country
SO PUBLIC MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE history; human resource management; Malaysia; performance management;
   policy transfer; public management
ID CIVIL-SERVICE; INDUSTRIAL-RELATIONS; REFORM; HRM
AB This article uses a case study of public human resource management
   (HRM) in Malaysia to explore policy 'transferability', proposed as a
   refinement of Dolowitz and Marsh's policy transfer framework.
   HRM in the Malaysian civil service is found to be relatively
   performance-orientated, though that is qualified by the Government's
   affirmative action policies. Malaysia's approach is attributed to
   factors that have their roots in Malaysia's history: the pervasive
   respect for authority, the ethnic mix, its Anglo-Saxon orientation, the
   successful economy, the National Development Policy of 1990 and the
   personal role of former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. These factors
   suggest that public management is both shaped and constrained by its
   historical roots. The case suggests that successful policy transfer
   requires an understanding of those roots, especially when there is a
   significant distance in cultural, political, economic or linguistic
   terms between the countries transferred from and to.

DT Article
DE accounting change; Australian higher education policy; knowledge

AB This article presents the findings of a project investigating the
   intended and unintended consequences of the contemporary
   performance-driven environment in the Australian higher education
   sector (AHES) focusing on the performance mechanisms used and the
   performance information required. It is argued that the establishment
   of a performance-driven, market-oriented university system in Australia
   has created a context in which fiscal and economic performance
   indicators have become dominant in understanding the 'performance' of
   the AHES and of individual universities' activities. This article
   analyses the AHES policy environment since the mid-1980s and outlines
   Australia's performance-based funding approach to universities. The
   contribution of universities to the nation's economy and the developing
   benchmarks and performance indicators (Pls) used for annual reporting
   at system and institutional levels are described. Several key issues
   are identified as arising from contemporary government policies. These
   issues, which form the basis for the suggested future research agenda,
   touch the core of university purposes and operations and need thought
   and resolution to ensure the long-term success of Australian public
   universities.

AB The identification of cardiac progenitor cells in mammals raises the
   possibility that the human heart contains a population of stem cells
   capable of generating cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels. The
   characterization of human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) would have
   important clinical implications for the management of the failing
   heart. We have established the conditions for the isolation and
   expansion of c-kit-positive hCSCs from small samples of myocardium.
   Additionally, we have tested whether these cells have the ability to
   form functionally competent human myocardium after infarction in
   immunocompromised animals. Here, we report the identification in vitro
   of a class of human c-kit-positive cardiac cells that possess the
   fundamental properties of stem cells: they are self-renewing,
   clonogenic, and multipotent. hCSCs differentiate predominantly into
   cardiomyocytes and, to a lesser extent, into smooth muscle cells and
   endothelial cells. When locally injected in the infarcted myocardium of
   immunodeficient mice and immuno-suppressed rats, hCSCs generate a
   chimeric heart, which contains human myocardium composed of myocytes,
   coronary resistance arterioles, and capillaries. The human myocardium
   is structurally and functionally integrated with the rodent myocardium
   and contributes to the performance of the infarcted heart.
   Differentiated human cardiac cells possess only one set of human sex
   chromosomes excluding cell fusion. The lack of cell fusion was
   confirmed by the Cre-lox strategy. Thus, hCSCs can be isolated and
   expanded in vitro for subsequent autologous regeneration of dead
   myocardium in patients affected by heart failure of ischemic and
   nonischemic origin.

AB Attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a commonly
   occurring, heritable neurobehavioral disorder distributed worldwide
   that does not typically resolve after childhood. The significant impact
   of ADHD on an individual's family, relationships, educational
   performance, and performance at work is now well established. Medical
   treatment of ADHD is effective, not only alleviating symptoms but also
   improving overall functioning. It is imperative that primary care
   physicians be well versed in this disorder and its clinical features
   across the age groups. The primary care physician should be able to
   screen, diagnose, educate, and initiate medication management in
   patients with uncomplicated ADHD.

AB Atrial fibrillation is a very common cardiovascular disease in clinical
   practice. One relevant issue to understand its pathophysiological
   mechanisms is the analysis and interpretation of atrial electrograms (
   AEG). To study these signals properly, ventricular activity has to be
   removed from the AEG. In this work, a new application of independent
   component analysis ( ICA) to the AEG is presented, where ventricular
   activity is removed from atrial epicardial recordings making use of
   only one reference lead. Therefore the technique is suitable when
   multi-lead recordings are unavailable as in atrial implantable
   cardioverter defibrilators. In addition to the proposed new methodology
   this work also presents the first comparative study, making use of
   unipolar epicardial AEGs, among the ICA-based technique, template
   matching and subtraction ( TMS), and adaptive ventricular cancellation
   ( AVC) on a database of 20 patients. A performance comparative analysis
   was carried out by evaluating epicardial atrial waveform similarity (
   S) and ventricular depolarization reduction ( VDR) as a function of
   atrial rhythm regularity on a beat-by-beat basis. Results indicate
   that, when the epicardial atrial rhythm is quite organized, ICA is able
   to preserve the atrial waveform very precisely and better than the
   other methods ( median S = 99.64% +/- 0.31% in contrast to 95.18% +/-
   2.71% for TMS and 94.76% +/- 4.12% for AVC). Moreover, ventricular
   reduction is the best for ICA ( median VDR = 6.32 +/- 4.41 dB in
   contrast to 4.98 +/- 4.48 dB for TMS and 4.12 +/- 2.72 dB for AVC). On
   the other hand, when the atrial activity is disorganized, TMS notably
   improves performance ( S = 97.72% +/- 1.87%), but ICA still is the best
   in waveform preservation ( S = 98.22% +/- 1.53%) whereas AVC remains
   similar ( S = 93.74% +/- 4.38%). In conclusion, ICA can be considered
   as notably the best approach to reduce ventricular activity from
   unipolar atrial electrograms in organized atrial arrhythmias. On the
   other hand, both TMS and ICA give quite similar results when the atrial
   arrhythmia is disorganized.

TI Thermalhydraulics studies examining the feasibility for introducing
   slightly enriched uranium fuel into the Embalse CANDU reactor
SO NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB A joint study on the technical feasibility of using 0.9% slightly
   enriched uranium (SEU) fuel in the Embalse CANDU reactor was performed
   by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) and Nucleoelectrica Argentina
   S.A. (NASA). The feasibility study focused on the following technical
   areas: reactor physics and fuel management, fuel performance, and
   safety. Part of the safety assessment involved detailed
   thermalhydraulics analyses of three accident scenarios for a full core
   of SEU fuel bundles: (i) slow loss-of-reactivity control (LORC) event,
   (ii) large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LBLOCA) with emergency core
   cooling system (ECCS) available, and (iii) end-fitting failure. Other
   accident scenarios possibly encountered during the demonstration
   irradiation exercise or transition core have also been examined. It is
   concluded that introducing SEU fuel into the Embalse CANDU reactor is
   feasible. Clear advantages (e.g., fuel cost saving, increase in fuel
   exit burnup, and reduction in spent fuel volume) have been identified.
   The reduction in maximum bundle powers and the shift of the maximum
   bundle-power location to the inlet of the channel for the SEU fuel
   improve operating and safety margins. These margins are higher with the
   CANFLEX SEU fuel than the 37-element SEU fuel, due to lower linear
   powers and improved thermalhydraulic design. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Mark-recapture studies are an important component of fisheries research
   and management. Underlying assumptions of such studies include minimal
   tag loss and negligible effects on the behavior, fitness, and survival
   of tagged individuals. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags are
   becoming increasingly commonplace, largely because of their small size,
   ease of implantation, longevity, and reportedly high rates of
   retention. We evaluated tag retention and survival and growth effects
   on age-0 muskellunge Esox masquinongy marked with PIT tags at two
   implantation sites, the peritoneal cavity and the dorsal musculature,
   during overwinter trials in Illinois and Wisconsin. For both trials, no
   significant differences in survival (88.0-89.8%), relative daily growth
   (0.0006-100062 mm.mm(-1).d(-1)), or tag retention (99.5-99.8%) were
   observed among the two implantation groups and a control group.
   Survival and tag retention were also similar between trials. Our
   findings suggest that PIT tags implanted either in the peritoneal
   cavity or the dorsal musculature are acceptable for use in marking
   age-0 muskellunge.

TI Strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of copper: New
   technologies, more recycling or demand management?
SO MINERALS ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE environmental; modelling; mining; mineral processing; recycling
ID SUSTAINABILITY; FOCUS
AB Existing approaches to reducing environmental impacts along the metal
   production and consumption chain are focused largely at the plant scale
   for primary production, rather than considering the whole metal cycle.
   As such, many opportunities for systemic improvements are overlooked.
   This paper develops an approach to designing preferred futures for
   entire metal cycles that deliver reduced carbon footprints. Dynamic
   material flow models in Visual Basic((R)) are used to provide
   life-cycle-impact-assessment indicators, which help identify key
   intervention points along the metal cycle. This analysis also
   identifies which actors or agents along the value chain are responsible
   for, or can influence, behaviour which affects environmental
   performance. With this information, it is possible to evaluate
   different scenarios for transition paths to achieve reduced impact.
   These scenarios consider combinations of new technology, increased
   metal recycling and demand management strategies. A case study for the
   copper cycle in the USA shows that to meet a CO2 reduction target of
   60% by 2050, innovative technologies for primary processing of mined
   ore will play a limited role, due to their increasing impacts in the
   future associated with mining ever lower ore grades. To compensate for
   this whilst meeting demand projections, recycling of old scrap would be
   required to increase from 18% to 80%, requiring extensive collaboration
   between primary and secondary producers. An alternate scenario which
   focuses on demand reduction for copper by 1% per year, meets the CO2
   target whilst only requiring an increase in the recycling rate from 18%
   to 36%. Together, these suggest that there is merit in examining the
   'metal-in-use' stage of the metal value chain more closely in order to
   achieve targeted reductions in CO2. The approach also highlights the
   inherent trade-offs between different aspects of environmental
   performance which are required when pursuing CO2 reduction targets. (c)

AB Managers have increasingly implemented knowledge databases and
   knowledge-sharing training to improve team effectiveness. The authors
   examine whether intranet-based repository use and perception of
   accurate team knowledge of who knows what were related to perceived
   team effectiveness. They found that the perception that one's team had
   accurate who-knows-what knowledge is positively related to perceived
   team effectiveness. Repository use is not positively related to
   perceived team effectiveness. Remote work and tenure are not
   significant moderators of these relationships. These findings imply
   that perception of an accurate cognitive map of who knows what is more
   important to perceived team effectiveness than accessing information
   from repositories, regardless of remote work status or organizational
   tenure.

AB This study investigated the physical state and metabolic status of
   lambs of different birth ranks soon after birth. The aim was to
   identify the factors that result in poorer survival rates in triplet
   than single or twin lambs. Six hundred and twenty one Romney ewes were
   mated over a 4-day period and 46 of them were observed continually from
   day 143 of pregnancy until they finished lambing. Blood samples, taken
   from all lambs within 5 min of birth, were placed on ice, centrifuged
   and the plasma harvested and subsequently analysed for glucose,
   fructose, lactate, thyroxine (T4) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT).
   The rectal temperature of each lamb was recorded at birth and at 1, 2,
   3 and 6 h of life. Lambs were weighed and measured at 3 h of age.
   At birth, triplet lambs were significantly lighter (P<0.05) and had
   lower (P<0.05) plasma fructose and thyroxine than twin and single
   lambs, higher (P<0.05) lactate concentrations and a lower rectal
   temperature (P<0.05) than twin lambs. These observations suggest that
   they are subject to placental insufficiency. The packed cell volume was
   significantly (P<0.001) higher in twin than triplet lambs. The order at
   birth of twin or triplet lambs had no effect on birthweight or plasma
   metabolite concentrations. The smallest triplet was significantly
   lighter (P<0.05) and had higher plasma lactate (P<0.05) concentration
   than the largest triplet.
   These physiological limitations found in smaller triplet lambs at birth
   leave them prone to perinatal mortality. Management techniques, to
   increase triplet lamb birthweight and thereby improve their survival
   outcome need further investigation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The aim of this study, which was part of the EU-financed project Life
   Ammonia, was to evaluate the effects of dietary components and milk
   production on nitrogen efficiency of dairy cows. The study included
   examining the effects of decreased crude protein (CP) concentration in
   a grass-clover silage based diet and results of mixing whole-crop
   barley silage (WCBS) with grass-clover silage in the diet, on feed
   intake, milk production and nitrogen efficiency. Rations were
   formulated and milk production data were registered individually each
   month for 42 cows of the Swedish Red Cattle breed during four indoor
   periods from 1999 to 2003. The range in nitrogen efficiency by the
   cows, 11 to 398 days in milk, was 18 to 40%, when fed a diet containing
   135 to 184 g CP/kg DM, 44 to 56% of NDF as rumen degradable fibre (RDF)
   and milking 13 to 57 kg of ECM daily. The average CP concentration of
   the diet, containing mainly grass-clover silage and concentrate, was
   decreased from 168 g/kg DM (170 g in early lactation) in the control
   treatment period to 160 g/kg DM (163 g in early lactation) during the
   following treatment period. The CP concentration was 170 g/kg DM (171 g
   in early lactation) during the third treatment period, when the
   grass-clover silage was fed in a mixture with WCBS. Using the whole
   data set (n=284 for primiparous, n=440 for multiparous cows based on
   measurements each month) resulted in models, in which total DM intake,
   ECM yield, dietary CP concentration and RDF were the most important
   factors affecting nitrogen utilisation of primiparous and multiparous
   cows. Increases in both average DM intake and milk yield by multiparous
   cows and no changes in average intake and milk yield by primiparous
   cows fed the low CP diet or the normal CP diet containing WCBS,
   compared to cows fed the normal CP diet, resulted in similar nitrogen
   efficiencies among the treatments. Hence, dietary CP concentrations of
   160 to 170 g/kg DM can be used for cows in early lactation in
   commercial herds to improve nitrogen utilisation without causing a
   simultaneous decrease in milk yield. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Cow-calf enterprises provide significant opportunity for supplemental
   income to small-scale farmers in Appalachia, despite considerable
   production and economic uncertainty. To assess the viability of
   pasture-raised beef systems as alternatives to conventional production
   and marketing paradigms, stochastic budgets representative of several
   hypothetical producers of each type were constructed and evaluated via
   Monte Carlo techniques in terms of relative profitability and risk.
   Statistical distributions were utilized to capture seasonal variability
   in output prices, pasture availability and animal performance. Results
   suggest that the intensive pasture and animal management required for
   pastureraised production yield greater profit and less economic risk
   than conventional strateoies.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Crop survival as influenced by integrated N management (INM) in rice
   variety 'Gayatri' was studied following 10 days of complete submergence
   at maximum tillering stage during 2003 and 2004 in the Central Rice
   Research Institute, Cuttack, India. Organic N sources such as farmyard
   manure (FYM) and Sesbania aculeate were included in INM along with
   fertilizers N and P. Crops with the combined organics of FYM and
   Sesbania survived better after submergence, which was attributed to
   higher biomass production, less tiller mortality, greater root
   development, and higher critical N content in leaf, as compared with
   other treatments. These crops produced significantly higher grain yield
   (2.97 and 3.09 t ha(-1) in 2003 and 2004) compared with those with
   application of FYM (2.48 and 2.61 t ha-1), use of Sesbania (2.24 and
   2.35 t ha- 1) and chemical fertilizer N (1.98 and 2.07 t ha- 1) alone.
   In both the years, application of P also led to higher grain yields
   (2.40 and 2.52 t ha- 1) compared with no application of P (2.19 and
   2.29 t ha- 1). Interaction of INM with P showed that application of P
   with the combined organics increased grain yield by 13.1-13.7%,
   followed by that with FYM (10.16-12.2%), Sesbania (8.37-8.89%), and
   fertilizer N (7.338.04%). In both the years, greater nutrient
   utilization as evidenced by N use efficiency (29.2 and 29.7 kg grain
   per kg N ha- 1), N uptake (54.0 and 57.0 kg ha- 1), and N recovery
   (35.0 and 41.5%) was attributed to the crops with combined organics. P
   use efficiency (10.5 and 11.5 kg grain per kg P ha(-1)), P uptake (14.9
   and 16.5 kg ha-1), and P recovery (28.5 and 31.5%) were higher in the
   treatments with applied P. Thus the study revealed that application of
   both FYM and Sesbania in combination with fertilizers N and P in rice
   improved crop growth resulting in increased grain yield and nutrient
   utilization in flood-prone situations.,Therefore, it is recommended to
   follow INM that included FYM and Sesbania in combination with both
   fertilizers N and P in rice cultivation for increasing grain yield in
   flood-prone lowland situations.

AB Outlined is a practical approach to size and modify agricultural
   drainage channels to two-stage geometry to maintain drainage function
   and capacity while increasing channel stability. Two-stage channel
   systems consist of an inset channel and small floodplain (benches)
   within the ditch confines. The two-stage channel sizing procedure
   includes nine steps: (1) project identifications (2) data collection;
   (3) data analysis; (4) hydrologic evaltiation: (5) conceptual channel
   system sizing; (6) project assessment; (7) design and/or final sizing:
   (8) construction; and (9) monitoring and assessment of performance.
   Channel width and depth dimensions are determined based on a
   weight-of-evidence approach that considers geomorphology measurements
   at the project site and throughout the watershed. The authors inhave
   developed spreadsheet tools to aid in evaluating the geornorphology of
   one and twosta stage channels. Constructing a two-stage channel
   requires more excavation than traditional ditch maintenance, but
   benefits include improved conveyance capacity, a channel geometry that
   will be more self-sustaining. and improvement to in-stream habitat.

TI NPD planning activities and innovation performance: The mediating role
   of process management and the moderating effect of product
   innovativeness

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of planning and
   control on the performance of new product development (NPD) projects.
   It is hypothesized that (1) thorough business planning at the beginning
   of a project creates a basis for proficient project and risk planning,;
   (2) the proficiency of project planning, risk planning, and process
   management activities each improves innovation performance directly;
   (3) the relationship of planning and success is mediated by process
   management; and (4) the strength of these relationships is moderated by
   uncertainty, as determined by the degree of innovativeness. To test the
   hypotheses, data from 132 NPD projects were collected and analyzed. A
   measurement model was used to establish valid and reliable constructs,
   a path model to test the main effects, and a multiple-moderated
   regression analysis for the moderator hypotheses. The results suggest
   that the proficiency of project planning and process management is
   important predictors of NPD performance. Specifically, project risk
   planning and goal stability throughout the development process are
   found to enhance performance significantly. Business planning proves to
   be an important antecedent of the more development-related planning
   activities such as project planning and risk planning. Additionally,
   the results lend support to the hypotheses regarding the mediating role
   of process management in the planning-performance relationship. Project
   planning and risk planning support the quality of process management
   and thus impact NPD performance indirectly. Only to a limited extent
   are the strengths of these relationships moderated by the degree of
   innovativeness of the NPD project.

AB There is strong evidence of the importance of good design to company
   success. However, it is apparent that despite this evidence, design
   skills are often marginalized in small and medium-size enterprises
   (SMEs). This article presents a design audit tool that captures good
   design principles in a form accessible to industry. Previous audit
   approaches have focused extensively on the management of new product
   development (NPD). In this research, the audit tool is based on process
   maturity principles and explicitly targets the design related
   activities in NPD-specifically in small firms. The design audit has
   been developed iteratively by application in action research mode and
   is supported by evidence from literature and exploratory cases. This
   inductive development enabled the generation of a robust audit tool
   through intervention in small firms to improve design practices. The
   resulting audit tool is designed for use in a multifunctional workshop
   setting. Typical outputs from application include the generation of
   action plans for improvement in future performance. This audit tool is
   based around a model of good design that explicitly distinguishes
   between management and design related activities in NPD. The audit tool
   has succeeded in encouraging managers to pay greater attention to the
   design related elements of NPD. This complements the satisfaction of
   managerial goals typically emphasized in many NPD processes.

AB Background: An intervention to reduce complications from insertion of
   small-bore nasogastric feeding tubes was performed. Methods: This was a
   Performance Improvement project with the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA)
   format; interventions occurred in July 2003. Electronic searches of
   risk management and radiology databases identified feeding tube
   malpositions and complications from January 1, 2001, through December
   31, 2004. Chart abstraction and a pre- and postintervention comparison
   were performed. Interventions were adoption of a more compliant feeding
   tube, direct supervision of residents, technology-guided insertion, and
   implementation of explicit policies and procedures. Results: Of all
   small-bore nasogastric feeding-tube placements, 1.3%-2.4% resulted in
   50 documented cases of feeding-tube malpositions during 4 years. Over
   half of the 50 patients were mechanically ventilated, and only 2 had a
   normal mental status. There were 13 complications (26% of
   malpositions), including 2 deaths, which were directly attributed to
   the feeding-tube malposition. Only 2 of the 13 complications and none
   of the misplacements had been recorded in the risk management database;
   most cases were identified from the search of radiology reports. In the
   15-month postintervention period, no complications were identified. The
   control chart showed that after the intervention, there was a
   significant increase in the "number between" tube insertions without
   complications, confirming the effectiveness of the performance
   improvement (PI) project. Conclusions: Unassisted feeding tube
   insertion carries significant risk in vulnerable patients, which can be
   mitigated. Voluntary reporting appears inadequate to capture
   complications from feeding tube insertion.

AB With the support of cellular system a cellular-based mobile ad hoc
   network (MANET) offers promising communication scenarios while entails
   secure data exchange as other wireless systems. In this paper, we
   propose a novel decentralized key generation mechanism using shared
   symmetric polynomials in which the base stations (BSs) carry out an
   initial key generation by a symmetric polynomial in a distributed
   manner and then pass on the key material to mobile stations (MSs).
   Thereafter, our proposed key generation scheme enables each pair of MSs
   to establish a pairwise key without any intervention from the 13S, thus
   reducing the management cost for the BS. The shared key between two
   NISs is computed without any interaction between them. In addition, the
   trust among NISs is derived from the cellular infrastructure, thus
   enjoying an equal security level as provided in the underlying cellular
   network. Simulations are done to observe the systern performance and
   the results are very encouraging. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB As Grids rapidly expand in size and complexity, the task of
   benchmarking and testing, interactive or unattended, quickly becomes
   unmanageable. In this article we describe the difficulties of
   testing[benchmarking resources in large Grid infrastructures and we
   present the software architecture implementation of GridBench, an
   extensible tool for testing, benchmarking and ranking of Grid
   resources. We give an overview of GridBench services and tools, which
   support the easy definition, invocation and management of tests and
   benchmarking experiments. We also show how the tool can be used in the
   analysis of benchmarking results and how the measurements can be used
   to complement the information provided by Grid Information Services and
   used as a basis for resource selection and user-driven resource
   ranking. In order to illustrate the usage of the tool, we describe
   scenarios for using the GridBench framework to perform test/benchmark
   experiments and analyze the results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI The "New economics" of clinical quality improvement: The case of
   community-acquired pneumonia
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; DISCHARGE; CARE
AB Hospitals and health systems have developed substantial infrastructure,
   at significant expense, to improve care quality and support the
   collection and distribution of quality metrics. Yet providers often
   have little understanding of what return, if any, they have earned on
   the investment because they typically view quality improvement efforts
   simply as a cost of doing business. After analyzing data from 10,512
   patients with community-acquired pneumonia, we found that better
   performance on two quality measures was associated with shorter length
   of stay and improved financial performance. For example, a one-day
   decrease in the time until patients were shifted from intravenous to
   oral antibiotics was associated with a 0.8-day reduction in length of
   stay and a nearly 60 percent increase in margins. Providers can adapt
   the methods we used to derive these findings to identify other quality
   metrics that simultaneously increase care quality and generate economic
   value. To derive maximum clinical and financial benefit, however,
   providers must ensure that clinical quality staff members are
   adequately supported and skilled to set priorities and to implement
   effective initiatives.

AB Baculoviral efficacy against lepidopteran larvae is substantially
   impacted by the host plant. Here, we characterized how baculoviral
   pathogenicity to cotton-fed Heliothis virescens larvae is affected by
   induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Numerous studies have
   shown that SAR induced by the plant elicitor
   benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) can
   protect against plant pathogens, but reports on the impacts of SAR on
   chewing herbivores or on natural enemies of herbivores are few. We
   found that BTH application significantly increased foliar peroxidase
   activity, condensed tannin levels, and total phenolic levels but did
   not alter dihydroxyphenolic levels. Consumption of BTH-treated foliage
   did not influence H. virescens pupal weight or larval mortality by the
   microbial control agent Autographa californica multiple
   nucleopolyhedrovirus any more than did consumption of untreated
   foliage. Thus, activation of SAR, although it did not protect the plant
   against a chewing herbivore, also did not reduce the effect of a
   natural enemy on a herbivore, indicating that SAR and microbial control
   agents may be compatible components of integrated pest management.

AB Recent, well-publicized accounting scandals have shown that the
   penalties outsiders impose on those found culpable of earnings
   management can be severe. However, less is known about how colleagues
   within internal labor markets respond when they believe fellow managers
   have managed earnings. Designers of responsibility accounting systems
   need to understand the reputational costs managers impose on one
   another within internal labor markets. In an experimental study, 159
   evening MBA students were asked to assume the role of a manager in a
   company and respond to a scenario in which another manager (the target
   manager) has the opportunity to engage in earnings management.
   Participants provided causal attributions, assessed the morality of the
   target manager, and indicated whether they would change their judgments
   about the target manager's reputation. The study manipulated three
   between-subjects factors: (1) whether the target manager chose to
   engage in earnings management, (2) whether the company's budgetary
   control system was rigid or flexible, and (3) whether the target
   manager's work history was average or above average. We found that
   causal attributions are affected more by the budgetary systems when the
   target did not manage earnings than when the manager did. We also found
   that morality judgments were significantly associated with the target
   manager's behavior, but not with the budgetary system. In addition,
   participants' judgments about the target manager's reputation were more
   strongly associated with morality judgments than with causal
   attributions. We discuss implications of the role of reputation in
   management control systems design.

TI How corporate social performance is institutionalised within the
   governance structure
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS

DT Article
DE corporate governance; corporate social performance; stakeholder
   influence
ID STAKEHOLDER THEORY; MANAGEMENT; COMPANIES; BUSINESS; SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB Since Ackerman in Corporate social responsiveness, the modern dilemma
   (1973), pleaded for the institutionalisation of corporate social
   performance (CSP) in business processes, researchers have focused on
   the role of strategy in CSP. This article demonstrates that CSP is
   institutionalised within the governance structure. We will attempt to
   make this clear by means of a description of the Dutch system of
   corporate governance. Under certain circumstances Dutch companies are
   already bound to CSP due to prevailing legislation. A governance
   perspective shows that CSP is institutionalised within a company's
   governance structure. "Processes of responsiveness", since long
   regarded as a starting point of CSP-analysis, appear to be
   decision-making processes. Within these processes the expectations of
   the stakeholders can be institutionalised, trust can be built and
   interests can be incorporated. This makes CSP context-dependent.
   However, it is possible to analyse companies by comparing the
   companies' individual governance structures. The article concludes that
   CSP-analysis can fruitfully extend into analysing in the role of the
   stakeholders in the influence-pathways that are incorporated within the
   governance structure.

   MANAGEMENT
AB A numerical investigation study was performed to study the phase change
   behavior of wax/foam composite encapsulated in an aluminum casing. Two
   types of foam materials, namely, aluminum and carbon, were infiltrated
   with paraffin wax. The progress of melt interface and temperature
   distribution within the encapsulated composite was analyzed using
   computational fluid dynamics software (CFD). A two-energy equation
   model was implemented in the CFD software through the use of user
   defined function (UDF). Interfacial effects influencing the heat
   transfer process at the casing-composite junction and between the
   wax-foam surfaces within the composite were addressed through the use
   of separate UDE In addition, the effect of capillary pressure developed
   within the foam matrix was incorporated using an area ratio parameter.
   The contact resistance at the foam-casing interface and the capillary
   pressure had a major influence on the thermal behavior of the system.
   These two factors lowered down the heat transfer rate considerably and
   the melting area was reduced by more than 30%. The temperature profiles
   for the foam material showed a different pattern as compared to the
   temperature within the wax, which was due to the effect of thermal
   nonequilibrium. (c) 2007 American Insiitute of Physics.

TI On-chip hot spot cooling using silicon thermoelectric microcoolers
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTACT RESISTANCE; OHMIC CONTACTS; DEVICES; POWER
AB Thermal management of microprocessors has become an increasing
   challenge in recent years because of localized high flux hot spots
   which cannot be effectively removed by conventional cooling techniques.
   This paper describes the use of the silicon chip itself as a
   thermoelectric cooler to suppress the hot spot temperature. A
   three-dimensional analytical thermal model of the silicon chip,
   including localized thermoelectric cooling, thermoelectric heating,
   silicon Joule heating, hot spot heating, background heating, and
   conductive/convective cooling on the back of the silicon chip, is
   developed and used to predict the on-chip hot spot cooling performance.
   The effects of hot spot size, hot spot heat flux, silicon chip
   thickness, microcooler size, doping concentration in the silicon, and
   parasitic Joule heating from electric contact resistance on the cooling
   of on-chip hot spots, are investigated in detail. (c) 2007 American

TI Isolating the 'farmer' effect as a component of the advantage of
   growing genetically modified varieties in developing countries: a Bt
   cotton case study from Jalgaon, India
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID PINK-BOLLWORM; PERFORMANCE; MAHARASHTRA; RESISTANCE; CHINA
AB The present paper explores the 'farmer' effect in economic advantages
   often claimed for Bt cotton varieties (those with the endotoxin gene
   from Bacillus thuringiensis conferring resistance to some insect pests)
   compared to non-Bt varieties. Critics claim that much of the yield
   advantage of Bt cotton could be due to the fact that farmers adopting
   the technology are in a better position to provide inputs and
   management and so much of any claimed Bt advantage is an artefact
   rather than reflecting a real advantage of the variety per se. The
   present paper provides an in-depth analysis of 63 non-adopting and 94
   adopting households of Bt cotton in Jalgaon, Maharashtra State, India,
   spanning the seasons 2002 and 2003. Results suggest that Bt adopters
   are indeed different from non-adopters in a number of ways. Adopters
   appear to specialize more on cotton (at least in terms of the land area
   they devote to the crop), spend more money on irrigation and grow
   well-performing non-Bt varieties of cotton (Bunny). Taking gross margin
   as the basis for comparison, Bt plots had 2.5 times the gross margin of
   non-Bt plots in both seasons. If only adopters are considered then the
   gross margin advantage of Bt plots reduces to 1.6 times that of non-Bt
   plots. This is still a significant advantage and could well explain the
   popularity of Bt in Maharashtra. However, it is clear that great care
   needs to be taken with such comparative studies.

AB We present and review several aspects of incoherent optical
   code-division multiple access (OCDMA), focusing on the flexible
   bandwidth allocation and its potential for future optical networks. We
   briefly present the various OCDMA approaches, coherent and incoherent,
   before focusing on the later and more specifically temporal 1D and 2D
   wavelength-hopping time spreading. We then concentrate on the
   properties specific to such schemes allowing for its increased
   scalability and flexibility. The main coding properties are reviewed,
   and the multicode property for increased performance and security is
   described. Several subsystems are presented to allow the compatibility
   of OCDMA on multihop networks where the properties of OCDMA would allow
   shifting some management functions down to the physical layer creating
   an optical layer with enhanced functionalities. (C) 2007 Optical

TI Telephone screening, outreach, and care management for depressed
   workers and impact on clinical and work productivity outcomes - A
   randomized controlled trial

   HEALTH-ORGANIZATION HEALTH; SERIOUS MENTAL-ILLNESS; COLLABORATIVE CARE;
   UNITED-STATES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMATOLOGY
   IDS; ANXIETY DISORDERS
AB Context Although guideline-concordant depression treatment is clearly
   effective, treatment often falls short of evidence-based
   recommendations. Organized depression care programs significantly
   improve treatment quality, but employer purchasers have been slow to
   adopt these programs based on lack of evidence for cost-effectiveness
   from their perspective.
   Objective To evaluate the effects of a depression outreach-treatment
   program on workplace outcomes, a concern to employers.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized controlled trial
   involving 604 employees covered by a managed behavioral health plan
   were identified in a 2-stage screening process as having significant
   depression. Patient treatment allocation was concealed and assessment
   of depression severity and work performance at months 6 and 12 was
   blinded. Employees with lifetime bipolar disorder, substance disorder,
   recent mental health specialty care, or suicidality were excluded.
   Intervention A telephonic outreach and care management program
   encouraged workers to enter outpatient treatment (psychotherapy and/or
   antidepressant medication), monitored treatment quality continuity, and
   attempted to improve treatment by giving recommendations to providers.
   Participants reluctant to enter treatment were offered a structured
   telephone cognitive behavioral psychotherapy.
   Main Outcome Measures Depression severity (Quick Inventory of
   Depressive Symptomatology, QIDS) and work performance (World Health
   Organization Health and Productivity Questionnaire [HPQ], a validated
   self-report instrument assessing job retention, time missed from work,
   work performance, and critical workplace incidents).
   Results Combining data across 6- and 12-month assessments, the
   intervention group had significantly lower QIDS self-report scores
   (relative odds of recovery, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.0; P =
   .009), significantly higher job retention (relative odds, 1.7; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.1-3.3; P = .02), and significantly more hours
   worked among the intervention (beta = 2.0; P = .02; equivalent to an
   annualized effect of 2 weeks of work) than the usual care groups that
   were employed.
   Conclusions A systematic program to identify depression and promote
   effective treatment significantly improves not only clinical outcomes
   but also workplace outcomes. The financial value of the latter to
   employers in terms of recovered hiring, training, and salary costs
   suggests that many employers would experience a positive return on
   investment from outreach and enhanced treatment of depressed workers.

ID FOOD SAFETY OBJECTIVES; CONTROL PROGRAM; MANAGEMENT; CATTLE;
   PREVALENCE; INFECTION
AB The Finnish Salmonella Control Programme and the special guarantees
   (SG) of import concerning Salmonella in the beef production chain were
   examined within the risk analysis framework. The appropriate level of
   protection (ALOP de facto since not referred to as ALOP in regulation),
   performance objectives (PO), and microbiological criteria (MC) were
   identified along the beef production chain. A quantitative
   microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) model using the Bayesian
   probabilistic method was developed for the beef chain to evaluate the
   capability of different POs to contribute to the ALOP. The influence of
   SGs was studied as an intervention protecting Finnish consumers. The
   QMRA made it possible to translate an ALOP without a stated food safety
   objective (FSO) to POs when implemented for both ready-to-eat (RTE) and
   non-RTE products. According to the results, the Finnish ALOP de facto
   for beef, beef preparations and products (10 human Salmonella cases/
   100,000) was reached in all of the years 1996-2004. However, if the
   prevalence at the slaughter, domestic cut beef, and retail levels would
   increase to the level of POs set (maximum 1%), the ALOP de facto would
   be exceeded by a factor of roughly two. On the other hand, the zero
   tolerance applied to MCS Would keep the true Salmonella prevalence at
   production steps with POs clearly below 1%, and the ALOP would then be
   achievable. The influence of SGs on the total exposure was so small
   (average 0.1% added to the total prevalence of beef-derived foods at
   retail) that their relevance may be doubted with the current amount and
   Salmonella prevalence in beef-derived imports. On the other hand, a
   change in import profile could increase the protective effect of the
   SGs. Although practical follow-up has to be carried out as apparent
   prevalences, the objectives and criteria should be estimated as true
   prevalences and incidences with quantified uncertainties in order to
   achieve a sound, transparent scientific -based understanding of the
   risk. The QMRA model developed here provided a useful tool for studying
   the connection between the ALOP and other targets in the production
   chain. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   emphasis is placed on intermediaries in managing conflicts.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected by means of a
   questionnaire from 392 employees of a convenience sample of 59
   organizations, most of which were located in Ankara.
   Findings - Factor analysis results showed that managers utilize as many
   as five strategies: mediation, inquisitorial (similar to arbitration),
   motivational tactics, conflict reduction through restructuring, and
   educating the parties. The conditions under which these strategies are
   used were analyzed by regression. Harmony emphasis in the organization
   led to increased use of mediation. However, harmony emphasis, when
   coupled with a low degree of delegation of authority to subordinates,
   resulted in increased use of the inquisitorial strategy. Harmony
   emphasis, when combined with substantive (as opposed to personal)
   conflicts and with high impact conflicts led to educating the
   subordinates. Motivational tactics were used more when the conflict had
   high impact at the workplace and had escalated or threatened to get out
   of control.
   Research limitations/implications - Readers are cautioned on possible
   common factor bias; relations between variables may have emerged as a
   result of the data being reported by the same respondent.
   Originality/value - The findings have research implications for future
   studies and for training of managers for conflict intervention in
   collectivistic cultures.

TI Uplink PID power control technique for TDMA-based cellular radio systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

ID MOBILE RADIO; PERFORMANCE
AB The efficient management of wireless resource is essential to the
   success of wireless systems. While power control is traditionally
   considered to be a means to counteract the detrimental effects of
   channel fading, it is also a flexible mechanism that achieves high link
   quality, high bandwidth utilization, and low power consumption, which
   are mainly driven in cellular radio systems. Once the power control
   algorithm provides a lower outage probability, the SUs experienced
   adequate link quality need not to competitively increase their
   transmission power. Spontaneously, the systems with lower power
   consumption and better bandwidth efficiency are achieved. In this
   paper, a novel power control based on the
   proportional-integration-derivative (PID) controller is proposed, and
   its performance with an autonomous closed-loop uplink power control
   model under the time division multiple access (TDMA) systems is
   presented. Computer simulation is used to illustrate the performance of
   the proposed power control algorithm in a cellular radio system With
   Rayleigh fading channels. The results show that our proposed power
   control algorithm is remarkably superior to several previous power
   control methods, especially in a short power control period. Copyright

AB Experiments were conducted to evaluate strategies designed to reduce
   heat stress of cattle. In the first experiment, cattle were sprinkled
   for 20 min every 1.5 h between 1000 hours and 1750 hours ( WET) versus
   not sprinkled ( DRY). In a second experiment, treatments consisted of:
   ( 1) control, no water application; ( 2) water applied to the pen
   surfaces between 1000 hours and 1200 hours ( AM); and ( 3) water
   applied to pen surfaces between 1400 hours and 1600 hours ( PM). In
   both experiments, sprinkling lowered ( P< 0.05) mid-afternoon
   temperatures. In the first experiment, relative humidity ( RH) of WET
   versus DRY pens differed ( P< 0.05) and averaged 72.4 and 68.9%,
   respectively. The average temperature-humidity index (THI) in WET pens
   was 0.5 units lower ( P< 0.05), than the THI in DRY pens. In the second
   experiment, RH in sprinkled pens was also greater ( P< 0.05) than RH in
   control ( CON) pens However, THI differed ( P< 0.05) among treatments,
   being 81.5, 80.9, and 80.3, respectively for CON, AM, and PM. Pens with
   sprinklers had a larger percentage of steers in areas where sprinkling
   took place, even on days when sprinkling had not occurred. Based on
   differences in percentage of cattle panting in sprinkled and
   non-sprinkled treatments, sprinkling was found to have a positive
   effect on cattle feeding area microclimate and to reduce the
   susceptibility of cattle to hyperthermia. However, cattle
   acclimatization to being sprinkled can result in slight hyperthermia
   even during cooler days when sprinkling would normally not be utilized.

ID DEEP-VEIN THROMBOSIS; SUSPECTED PULMONARY-EMBOLISM; PLASMA D-DIMER;
   VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM; WHOLE-BLOOD; DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS; EXCLUSION;
   PROBABILITY; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE
AB Background: The D-dimer assay is used as an exclusion test in the
   assessment of suspected venous thromboembolic disease; patients with a
   negative result have a low probability of thrombosis. We reviewed the
   D-dimer results from a hospital and community laboratory using the
   vidas D-dimer test to assess the influence of age on the D-dimer assay.
   Methods: D-dimer results from 6631 unselected patients aged more than
   16 years were analysed in four age groups and it was shown that the
   median D-dimer concentration increased with age (16-40 years, 294
   ng/mL; 40-60 years, 387 ng/mL; 60-80 years; 854 ng/mL; > 80 years, 1397
   ng/mL). To test the effect of age on the assay specificity, a cohort of
   1897 patients with suspected venous thromboembolic disease was analysed
   separately. Patients with a negative D-dimer were discharged without
   further investigation. Patients with a positive result and a clinical
   suspicion of thrombosis underwent further investigation. One hundred
   and sixty-five deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus cases were
   identified.
   Results: The assay specificity decreased with age from 70% in patients
   less than 40 years to below 5% in patients more than 80 years. Receiver
   operator curves were prepared for each age group and the effect of
   altering the threshold value was analysed. In patients 60-80 years old
   a threshold value of 1000 ng/mL increased assay specificity to 55%
   without loss of assay sensitivity.
   Conclusion: The vidas D-dimer assay with a threshold value of 500 ng/mL
   has little clinical value as an exclusion test in patients more than 80
   years old. The assay specificity is poor (26%) in patients aged 60-80
   years but could be improved by increasing the threshold value to 1000
   ng/mL. We believe that this should be tested in a prospective trial.

AB We examined the relationships between the success of ERP system
   adoption, extent of business process improvement (BPI), and
   organizational performance and investigated the associations between
   the outcomes of these initiatives and such organizational factors as
   strategic intent, senior management support, and the status of the IT
   function within a company. A correlation analysis of 96 firms was made
   to test our hypothesis that the strategic intent to use ERP was closely
   related to the success of BPI, ERP, and organizational performance. The
   results also demonstrated that CEO-IT distance may have little direct
   bearing on the outcomes of ERP and BPI initiatives. A closer CEO-IT
   reporting relationship, however, was found to be associated with higher
   levels of senior management support for both types of enterprise
   projects. This empirical evidence reinforced the long-held assumption
   that organization-level benefits, BPI, and ERP success were closely
   related; and that these relationships were subject to the influence of
   the organizational variables. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the influence of performance of active
   surveillance cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (
   MRSA) on the incidence of nosocomial MRSA bacteremia in an endemic
   hospital.
   DESIGN. Before-after trial.
   SETTING. A 700-bed hospital.
   PATIENTS. All patients admitted to the hospital who were at high risk
   for MRSA bacteremia.
   INTERVENTION. Performance of surveillance cultures for detection of
   MRSA were recommended for all patients at high risk, and contact
   isolation was implemented for patients with positive results of
   culture. Each MRSA-positive patient received one course of eradication
   treatment. We compared the total number of surveillance cultures, the
   percentage of surveillance cultures with positive results, and the
   number of MRSA bacteremia cases before the intervention ( from January
   2002 through February 2003) after the start of the intervention ( from
   July 2003 through October 2004).
   RESULTS. The number of surveillance cultures performed increased from a
   mean of 272.57 cultures/month before the intervention to 865.83
   cultures/month after the intervention. The percentage of surveillance
   cultures with positive results increased from 3.13% before to 5.22%
   after the intervention . The mean number of MRSA bacteremia cases per
   month decreased from 3.6 cases before the (P < .001) intervention to
   1.8 cases after the intervention ( P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS. Active surveillance culture is important for identifying
   hidden reservoirs of MRSA. Contact isolation can prevent new
   colonization and infection and lead to a significant reduction of
   morbidity and healthcare costs.

   BORDETELLA-PERTUSSIS; UNITED-STATES; OUTBREAK; VACCINE; CULTURE;

AB Objective. To assess consumption of resources in the infection control
   management of healthcare workers ( HCWs) exposed to pertussis and to
   assess avoidability of exposure.
   Setting. Tertiary care children's medical center.
   Methods. Analysis of the extent of and reasons for HCW exposure to
   pertussis during contact with children with the disease, whether
   exposures were avoidable ( because of the failure to recognize a case
   or to order or adhere to isolation precautions) or unavoidable (
   because the case was not recognizable or because another diagnosis was
   confirmed), and the cost of implementing exposure management.
   Interventions. Interventions consisted of an investigation of every HCW
   encounter with any patient who was confirmed later to have pertussis
   from the time of hospital admission of the patient, use of azithromycin
   as postexposure prophylaxis ( PEP) for exposed HCWs, performance of
   21-day surveillance for cough illness, testing of symptomatic exposed
   HCWs for Bordetella pertussis, and enhanced preexposure education of
   HCWs.
   Results. From September 2003 through April 2005, pertussis was
   confirmed in 28 patients ( median age, 62 days); 24 patients were
   admitted. For 11 patients, pertussis was suspected, appropriate
   precautions were taken, and no HCW was exposed. Inadequate precautions
   for 17 patients led to 355 HCW exposures. The median number of HCWs
   exposed per exposing patient was 9 ( range, 1-86 HCWs; first quartile
   mean, 2; fourth quartile mean, 61). Exposure was definitely avoidable
   for only 61 ( 17%) of 355 HCWs and was probably unavoidable for 294
   HCWs ( 83%). The cost of 20-month infection control management of HCWs
   exposed to pertussis was $69,770. The entire cohort of HCWs involved in
   direct patient care at the facility could be immunized for
   approximately $60,000.
   Conclusions. Exposure of HCWs to pertussis during contact with children
   who have the disease is largely unavoidable, and management of this
   exposure is resource intensive. Universal preexposure vaccination of
   HCWs is a better utilization of resources than is case-based
   postexposure management.

ID HUMAN MOTION
AB We introduce (BME)-E-3, a Conditional Bayesian Mixture of Experts
   Markov Model, that achieves consistent probabilistic estimates for
   discriminative visual tracking. The model applies to problems of
   temporal and uncertain inference and represents the unexplored
   bottom-up counterpart of pervasive generative models estimated with
   Kalman filtering or particle filtering. Instead of inverting a
   nonlinear generative observation model at runtime, we learn to
   cooperatively predict complex state distributions directly from
   descriptors that encode image observations ( typically, bag-of-feature
   global image histograms or descriptors computed over regular spatial
   grids). These are integrated in a conditional graphical model in order
   to enforce temporal smoothness constraints and allow a principled
   management of uncertainty. The algorithms combine sparsity, mixture
   modeling, and nonlinear dimensionality reduction for efficient
   computation in high-dimensional continuous state spaces. The combined
   system automatically self-initializes and recovers from failure. The
   research has three contributions: 1) we establish the density
   propagation rules for discriminative inference in continuous, temporal
   chain models, 2) we propose flexible supervised and unsupervised
   algorithms to learn feed-forward, multivalued contextual mappings
   (multimodal state distributions) based on compact, conditional Bayesian
   mixture of experts models, and 3) we validate the framework empirically
   for the reconstruction of 3D human motion in monocular video sequences.
   Our tests on both real and motion-capture-based sequences show
   significant performance gains with respect to competing nearest
   neighbor, regression, and structured prediction methods.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE genetic algorithm (GA); lexicographic optimization; travel time
   estimation; vehicle feature; vehicle reidentification
AB An innovative feature of this paper is the demonstration of the
   feasibility of real-time vehicle reidentification algorithm development
   at a signalized intersection, where different traffic detection
   technologies were employed at upstream and downstream locations.
   Previous research by the authors on vehicle reidentification has
   utilized the same traffic sensors (e.g., conventional square inductive
   loops) and detectors (e.g., high-speed scanning detector cards) at both
   locations. In this paper, an opportunity arose for the first time to
   collect a downstream data set from a temporary installation of a
   prototype innovative inductive loop sensor known as a "blade" sensor in
   conjunction with conventional inductive loops upstream. At both
   locations, advanced high-speed scanning detector cards were used.
   Although the number of vehicles for which data could be collected was
   small, encouraging results were obtained for vehicle reidentification
   performance in this system of mixed traffic detection technologies. In
   future large-scale applications of vehicle reidentification approaches
   for real-time traffic performance measurement, management, and control,
   it would be most beneficial and practical if heterogeneous and
   homogeneous detection systems could be supported. This initial paper
   yielded many useful insights about this important issue and
   demonstrated on a small scale the feasibility of vehicle

AB Most automated expressway incident detection algorithms were
   successfully developed using loop-based traffic occupancy from their
   local conditions. However, the performance of these algorithms was not
   satisfactory on sites that have installed a video-based detector
   system. Due to different traffic detector technologies and varying
   driving behaviors from one region to another, it is of interest to
   develop an algorithm that uses video-based data. This paper used a
   total of 160 incidents collected along the 15-km Central Expressway
   (CTE) in Singapore to develop two new dual-station algorithms: the
   COmbined Detector Evaluation (CODE) and the flow-based CODE algorithms.
   On average, the flow-based CODE algorithm yielded better performance
   than the CODE in terms of average reduced false alarms of about 16%.
   Measures were also taken to ensure that the algorithms were properly
   developed and assessed. It was found that the CODE algorithm can
   detect, on average, up to 57% of the incidents faster than those of
   existing detection methods on CTE.

AB This paper studies the conflict resolution for intersecting flows of
   mobile agents based on planar space partition. The idea of space
   partition is first demonstrated for two intersecting flows of mobile
   agents. Then, for three intersecting flows, where simple decentralized
   conflict avoidance rules may not handle all traffic scenarios, it is
   proved that certain periodic partitions of space are able to provide
   conflict resolution for any distribution of agents in the flows. A
   computational procedure based on mixed integer programming is further
   proposed to find optimal space partitions. The approach of space
   partition is not an online optimization algorithm. An online algorithm
   may find optimal resolution of conflict for a specific set of mobile
   agents but has to be rerun each time when new agents arrive, whereas a
   periodic partition of space provides a priori geometrical configuration
   for conflict avoidance regardless of the number and arriving patterns
   of the agents. Moreover, the offline nature of space partition does not
   imply a decrease of performance. As demonstrated in an example
   involving three symmetrically arranged agent flows, the optimal space
   partition has found a tight upper bound for the magnitude of any
   conflict-free maneuvers.

ID HEALTH-CARE; TRANSMISSION
AB Hypertension and arrhythmia are chronic diseases, which can be
   effectively prevented and controlled only if the physiological
   parameters of the patient are constantly monitored, along with the full
   support of the health education and professional medical care. In this
   paper, a role-based intelligent mobile care system with alert mechanism
   in chronic care environment is proposed and implemented. The roles in
   our system include patients, physicians, nurses, and healthcare
   providers. Each of the roles represents a person that uses a mobile
   device such as a mobile phone to communicate with the server setup in
   the care center such that he or she can go around without restrictions.
   For commercial mobile phones with Bluetooth communication capability
   attached to chronic patients, we have developed physiological signal
   recognition algorithms that were implemented and built-in in the mobile
   phone without affecting its original communication functions. It is
   thus possible to integrate several front-end mobile care devices with
   Bluetooth communication capability to extract patients' various
   physiological parameters [such as blood Pressure, pulse, saturation of
   haemoglobin (SPO2), and electrocardiogram (ECG)], to monitor multiple
   physiological signals without space limit, and to upload important or
   abnormal physiological information to healthcare center for storage and
   analysis or transmit the information to physicians and healthcare
   providers for further processing. Thus, the physiological signal
   extraction devices only have to deal with signal extraction and
   wireless transmission. Since they do not have to do signal processing,
   their form factor can be further reduced to reach the goal of
   microminiaturization and power saving. An alert management mechanism
   has been included in back-end healthcare center to initiate various
   strategies for automatic emergency alerts after receiving emergency
   messages or after automatically recognizing emergency messages. Within
   the time intervals in system setting, according to the medical history
   of a specific patient, our prototype system can inform various
   healthcare providers in sequence to provide healthcare service with
   their reply to ensure the accuracy of alert information and the
   completeness of early warning notification to further improve the
   healthcare quality. In the end, with the testing results and
   performance evaluation of our implemented system prototype, we conclude
   that it is possible to set up a complete intelligent healt care chain
   with mobile monitoring and healthcare service via the assistance of our
   system.

TI Using a model-driven transformational approach and service-oriented
   architecture for service delivery management
SO IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB IT (information technology) service providers often assume that
   efficient and effective service delivery can be achieved by migrating
   to a standard set of tools. This assumption is true only if the service
   provider has monolithic control over the scope and architecture of the
   customer environment. The trend, however, is toward selective
   outsourcing, customer control over the architecture of IT solutions,
   and retention of legacy tools. Target environments are extremely
   heterogeneous, and the ability of the service provider to control them
   is diminishing. Consequently, there is a need for a new approach to IT
   service workflow automation and a new generation of service-delivery
   management systems that support heterogeneity and collaboration. This
   paper introduces a new approach to automating complex and variable
   workflows, applies this approach to IT service delivery management
   (SDM), presents an SDM architecture based on this approach, and
   discusses an SDM implementation driven by this architecture. our
   implementation architecture leverages service-oriented architecture
   (SOA) principles by defining loosely coupled service components and a
   service fulfillment pattern that dynamically integrates them. We
   discuss the modeling of performance metrics for service delivery and
   describe how the monitoring and management of key performance
   indicators (KPIs) are supported as an integral part of our SDM platform.

AB Introduction. Due to increasing need for and a shortage of donor
   organs, therapeutic procedures such as heart valve replacement for
   valve insufficiency and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for
   graft vasculopathy (GVP) must be performed to improve allograft
   function to avoid retransplantation.
   Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who
   underwent surgical procedures after orthotopic heart transplantation.
   Since 1989, we have performed more than 1400 heart transplantation
   procedures. Valve replacement was necessary in 8 patients and CABG was
   necessary in 3 patients. Five patients received valve prostheses ( 3
   bioprostheses and 2 mechanical valves) at the tricuspid position. Three
   patients received a Hancock bioprosthesis at the mitral position. One
   of the 3 received the valve 3 years after heart transplantation while
   suffering from mitral regurgitation grade IV, and another patient
   received the valve 1 year following heart transplantation while
   suffering from mitral insufficiency grade III due to infective
   endocarditis. Three patients underwent coronary artery
   revascularization, 2 patients underwent the procedure 1 and 7 years
   after heart transplantation because of GVP, 1 patient underwent the
   procedure simultaneously with heart transplantation because of donor
   coronary artery disease. One patient received concomitant CABG with
   heart transplantation because of 75% left anterior descending stenoses
   in the donor organ, and one patient received CABG 1 year after heart
   transplantation because of rapidly progressive GVP in the left anterior
   descending artery. The third patient had 3-vessel disease with 95% left
   stem and 75% ramus circum. ex, ramus marginalis, and ramus diagonalis.
   Results. Two patients who underwent CABG and 4 patients who underwent
   valve replacement are still alive and maintain good clinical
   performance. One patient with a graft at the mitral position died 9
   years after heart transplantation and 6 years after mitral valve
   replacement. Two patients with a graft at the tricuspid position died
   17 and 4 years after heart transplantation ( 6 and 3 years after valve
   replacement, respectively). One patient with a bioprostheses at the
   tricuspid position had to be retransplanted 2 years following valve
   replacement while suffering from a paravalvular leakage grade III.
   Conclusion. Cardiac surgical procedures can be safely performed after
   heart transplantation. To improve graft and patient survival, such
   procedures must be carefully performed after heart transplantation to
   avoid retransplantation. The shortage of donor organs will and must
   lead to an increase in the number of conventional procedures performed
   to improve allograft function in transplanted hearts.

AB Management systems for finishing beef cattle, designed to meet
   environmental goals in the Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) of the UK, often
   rely on the integration of grazing of semi-natural pastures with sown
   permanent pasture. In this experiment, three management options were
   compared: (i) permanent pasture for grazing and silage production
   (treatment PP), (ii) permanent pasture for grazing and silage and
   grazing of Molinia-dominant semi-natural pasture in summer from June to
   August inclusively (treatment PP + SNP) and (iii) permanent pasture for
   grazing and silage and red clover (RC) silage for 0.25 of the silage
   requirement in winter (treatment PP + RC). The performance of
   spring-born Welsh Black steers was measured from turnout in spring 2002
   until finishing in summer 2003. During summer 2002, the liveweight gain
   of steers grazing the semi-natural pasture was significantly lower than
   that of steers grazing the permanent pasture. There was a trend for the
   liveweight gains of the steers on the PP + SNP treatment to be higher
   from housing in autumn 2002, and live weights on all treatments were
   similar at the start of the red clover-feeding phase. Steers offered
   red clover silage had a significantly higher liveweight gains than
   those offered grass silage, but there was only a trend for a higher
   live weight at the end of the winter-feeding period. During summer
   2003, liveweight gains were again higher on the permanent pasture.
   Finishing system significantly affected the fatty-acid profile of the
   meat produced, but there was no difference in the colour of meat in
   relation to shelf-life. Lipid oxidation was less for the meat from
   steers on the PP + SNP treatment than on the PP treatment, which, in
   turn, was less than for meat from the steers on the PP + RC treatment,
   and was in inverse proportion to the vitamin E concentration in the
   loin muscle. There were no significant differences in sensory panel
   scores for texture, juiciness or flavour of the meat.

ID PARITY-CHECK CODES; TURBO CODES; PARALLEL TURBO; INTERLEAVER DESIGN;
   LDPC; ARCHITECTURES; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE
AB The ever increasing demand for high data rate communication, and the
   use of radio resource management techniques requiring frame-by-frame
   adaptive coding/modulation to match user demands and channel
   conditions, pose a number of crucial problems to the design of
   versatile, high-speed iterative decoders, for both turbo-like and
   low-density parity-check codes. Among them, we mention:
   The modification of the Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) algorithm in a
   way that permits its implementation using several parallel processors
   working independently on segments of the received frame.
   The collisions in the process of reading/writing into/from the memory
   by the parallel processors.
   The design of prunable interleavers covering a wide range of
   information and/or code words lengths while keeping good spreading
   properties.
   The design of codes yielding a wide range of code rates with good
   performance for the range of probability of error of interest.
   The paper will touch all the previous points, offering state-of-the art
   solutions and examples showing their performance. Copyright (C) 2007

AB The aim of this clinical study was to explore the contents of routine
   oral examinations (ROE), carried out by Dutch general dental
   practitioners (GDPs), in relation to the oral health status of
   regularly attending patients. An observational study was performed,
   based on clinical case recording. Using The Data Station Project of the
   Dutch Dental Association as the study base, 215 GDPs were recruited, of
   whom 131 participated in the study. A clinical case-recording form was
   developed to document clinical behavior. The contents assessed
   concerned patient characteristics, contents of the ROE visit, diagnoses
   made, and clinical behavior in response to ROE findings. This study
   showed substantial variation in clinical behavior related to specific
   ROE domains, including patient history and record keeping, whereas GDPs
   acted consistently on other domains, such as clinical examination and
   recall length assessment. Furthermore, the ROE performance was more
   strongly associated with GDP characteristics than with patient
   characteristics. The mean ROE time was 10 min, and recall intervals
   were most frequently assigned at 6 months, irrespective of the oral
   condition. This study highlights a need for continuing education to
   promote risk-based oral screening. Further research is needed to
   identify factors responsible for the variation in GDP performance, just
   as research on clinical practice guideline implementation methods is
   warranted.

   a new tool for the differential diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism
   during infancy

DT Article
DE recombinant human TSH; congenital hypothyroidism; total iodide
   organification defect; thyroid scintigraphy; perchlorate test
ID IODIDE ORGANIFICATION DEFECT; RECEPTOR GENE; MUTATIONS
AB Purpose Prompt initiation of L-thyroxine therapy in neonates with
   congenital hypothyroidism (CH) often prevents the performance of
   functional studies. Aetiological diagnosis is thus postponed until
   after infancy, when the required investigations are performed after
   L-thyroxine withdrawal. The aim of this study was to verify the
   efficacy and safety of new protocols for rhTSH (Thyrogen) testing
   during L-thyroxine replacement in the differential diagnosis of CH.
   Methods Ten CH patients (15-144 months old) were studied. Seven had
   neonatal evidence of gland in situ at the ultrasound examination
   performed at enrolment and received two rhTSH injections (4 mu g/kg
   daily, i.m.) with I-123 scintigraphy and perchlorate test on day 3.
   Three patients with an ultrasound diagnosis of thyroid dysgenesis
   received three rhTSH injections with I-123 scintigraphy on days 3 and
   4. TSH and thyroglobulin (Tg) determinations were performed on days 1,
   3 and 4, and neck ultrasound on day 1.
   Results rhTSH stimulation caused Tg levels to increase in eight cases.
   Blunted Tg responses were seen in two patients with ectopia and
   hypoplasia. Interestingly, in two cases the association of different
   developmental defects was demonstrated. Perchlorate test revealed a
   total iodide organification defect in two patients, including one with
   a neonatal diagnosis of Pendred's syndrome, who were subsequently found
   to harbour TPO mutations. rhTSH did not cause notable side-effects.
   Conclusion These new rhTSH protocols always resulted in accurate
   disease characterisation, allowing specific management and targeted
   genetic analyses. Thus, rhTSH represents a valid and safe alternative
   to L-thyroxine withdrawal in the differential diagnosis of CH in
   paediatric patients.

TI High yielding spring bread wheat germplasm for global irrigated and

   stability; Triticum aestivum; wheat
ID ENVIRONMENTS; IMPROVEMENT; LR19
AB Global wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production must increase 2%
   annually until 2020 to meet future demands. Breeding wheat cultivars
   with increased grain yield potential, enhanced water-use efficiency,
   heat tolerance, end-use quality, and durable resistance to important
   diseases and pests can contribute to meet at least half of the desired
   production increases. The remaining half must come through better
   agronomic and soil management practices and incentive policies.
   Analyses of the recent International Yield Trials indicate that grain
   yields of the best new entries were usually 10% higher than the local
   checks globally, as well as within a country across sites. Variation in
   yield across sites within a country/region underline the role of
   genotype x environment (GE) interaction and provides opportunities to
   select for stable genotypes, which is not often done. The lack of
   proper analysis undermines proper utilization of germplasm with high
   yield potential and stability in the national wheat breeding programs.
   Some of the best performers in irrigated areas were amongst the best in
   semiarid environments, reinforcing the fact that high yield potential
   and drought tolerance can be improved simultaneously. The best
   performing lines often had genotypic base of widely adapted genotypes
   Kauz, Attila, Baviacora, and Pastor, with genetic contributions from
   other parents including synthetic wheat. We recommend within country
   multilocation analysis of trial performance for a crop season to
   identify lines suiting particular or different locations within a
   country. The immediate feedback on GE interaction will also help in
   breeding lines for countries having substantial variation across
   locations and years.

TI MyLake - A multi-year lake simulation model code suitable for

AB Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis provide powerful means to enhance
   the performance of the models, to increase the transparency and
   credibility of the model results, and to allow the decision-maker to
   judge whether the model results are sufficiently accurate and precise
   to support decision-making or not. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
   of numerical models usually require hundreds, thousands, or even more,
   repeated model runs (e.g., in Monte Carlo simulation) as well as access
   to change the model parameters and variables on each model run.
   Consequently, many model codes, although widely used and
   well-formulated, are not well-suited for uncertainty and sensitivity
   analysis due to too long model execution time or due to lack of
   suitable interface to change model parameters and variables in an
   automated way. In this paper, we describe in details a lake model code,
   which aims to combine good simulation capabilities with efficient model
   execution time and easy application of numerical uncertainty and
   sensitivity analysis techniques. This model code is called MyLake
   (Multi-year Lake simulation model) and it is a one-dimensional
   process-based model code for simulation of daily vertical distribution
   of lake water temperature and thus density stratification, evolution of
   seasonal lake ice and snow cover, sediment-water interactions, and
   phosphorus-phytoplankton dynamics. After giving a detailed technical
   description of the different processes and algorithms included in the
   current version 1.2 of the MyLake model code, we present some results
   from a model application example including an Extended Fourier
   Amplitude Sensitivity Test (Extended FAST) sensitivity analysis and a
   simple Monte Carlo simulation based uncertainty analysis. Finally we
   discuss the performance of the MyLake code, especially in connection
   with numerical uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques.

AB The importance of species richness for repelling exotic plant invasions
   varies from ecosystem to ecosystem. Thus, in order to prioritize
   conservation objectives, it is critical to identify those ecosystems
   where decreasing richness will most greatly magnify invasion risks. Our
   goal was to determine if invasion risks greatly increase in response to
   common reductions in grassland species richness. We imposed treatments
   that mimic management-induced reductions in grassland species richness
   (i.e., removal of shallow- and/or deep-rooted forbs and/or grasses
   and/or cryptogam layers). Then we introduced and monitored the
   performance of a notorious invasive species (i.e., Centaurea maculosa).
   We found that, on a per-gram-of-biomass basis, each resident plant
   group similarly suppressed invader growth. Hence, with respect to
   preventing C. maculosa invasions, maintaining overall productivity is
   probably more important than maintaining the productivity of particular
   plant groups or species. But at the sites we studied, all plant groups
   may be needed to maintain overall productivity because removing forbs
   decreased overall productivity in two of three years. Alternatively,
   removing forbs increased productivity in another year, and this led us
   to posit that removing forbs may inflate the temporal productivity
   variance as opposed to greatly affecting time-averaged productivity. In
   either case, overall productivity responses to single plant group
   removals were inconsistent and fairly modest, and only when all plant
   groups were removed did C. maculosa growth increase substantially over
   a no-removal treatment. As such, it seems that intense disturbances
   (e.g., prolonged drought, overgrazing) that deplete multiple plant
   groups may often be a prerequisite for C. maculosa invasion.

AB Good water management is literally vital for the and and semi-arid
   regions of the planet. Yet good water management requires
   multidisciplinary expertise, since one must consider climatic,
   hydrological, economical and social aspects to make balanced decisions
   on water usage. We here present SegHidro, a Grid portal designed to
   foster scientific, technical and operational collaboration to improve
   water resources management. The portal targets researchers and decision
   makers, enabling them to execute and couple their computational models
   in a workflow. The portal provides a framework which allows seamless
   integration of the models, meaning that each phase of the flow may be
   executed by a different expert and that the resulting data are shared
   among other portal users. Due to the nature of these applications and
   the need to execute many prospective scenarios, their execution
   requires high computing power. However, we go beyond providing
   high-performance computational Grid capabilities. We also enable people
   to complement each other's expertise in understanding the trade-offs in
   the water allocation decisions. The SegHidro portal is about sharing:
   human expertise, data and computing power. Copyright (c) 2007 John

AB Background
   Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological
   treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative
   therapies such as acupuncture are still widely practiced. However, it
   remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to
   support its use.
   Objectives
   To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in people with
   insomnia.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (
   CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts
   International, CINAHL, AMED ( the Allied and Complementary Medicine
   Database), TCMLARS ( Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis
   and Retrieval System), National Center for Complementary and
   Alternative Medicine, the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials
   Database, the Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, the Trials Register
   of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, from inception to 2006,
   and the sleep bibliography, which is available at
   www.websciences.org/bibliosleep. We searched reference lists of
   retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the
   field for information on ongoing/completed trials.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture
   involving participants of any age with any type of insomnia were
   included. Included trials compared acupuncture with placebo or sham or
   no treatment, or acupuncture plus other treatments compared with the
   same other treatments. Trials that compared only acupuncture methods or
   compared acupuncture alone against other treatments alone were
   excluded, since they did not yield the net effect of acupuncture.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality
   according to a set of criteria for risk of selection bias, performance
   bias, attrition bias and detection bias. Relative risk (RR) and
   standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were
   used for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. Data were
   combined in meta-analyses ( on an intention-to-treat basis), where more
   than one trial without significant clinical heterogeneity presented the
   same outcome.
   Main results
   Seven trials met the inclusion criteria. The studies included 590
   participants with insomnia, of whom 56 dropped out. Participant age
   ranged from 15 to 98 years, and the duration of insomnia varied from 6
   months to 19 years. Co-existingmedical conditions contributing to
   insomnia included stroke, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. Apart
   from conventional needle acupuncture, different variants of acupuncture
   such as acupressure, auricular magnetic and seed therapy, and
   transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation ( TEAS) were evaluated.
   Meta-analysis was limited because of considerable heterogeneity between
   comparison groups and between outcome measures.
   Based on the findings from individual trials, the review suggested that
   acupuncture and acupressure may help to improve sleep quality scores
   when compared to placebo ( SMD = -1.08, 95% CI = -1.86 to -0.31,
   p=0.006) or no treatment ( SMD -0.55, 95% CI = 0.89 to -0.21, p=0.002).
   TEAS also resulted in better sleep quality score in one trial (SMD=
   -0.74, 95% CI = -1.22 to -0.26, p=0.003). However, the efficacy of
   acupuncture or its variants was inconsistent between studies for many
   sleep parameters, such as sleep onset latency, total sleep duration and
   wake after sleep onset. The combined result from three studies
   reporting subjective insomnia improvement showed that acupuncture or
   its variants was not more significantly effective than control (RR =
   1.66, 95% CI = 0.68 to -4.03) and significant statistical heterogeneity
   was observed. Only one study reported an adverse event, with one out of
   16 patients (6.3%) withdrawing from acupuncture because of pain.
   Authors' conclusions
   The small number of randomised controlled trials, together with the
   poor methodological quality and significant clinical heterogeneity,
   means that the current evidence is not sufficiently extensive or
   rigorous to support the use of any form of acupuncture for the
   treatment of insomnia. Larger high quality clinical trials employing
   appropriate randomisation concealment and blinding with longer
   follow-up are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of
   acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia.

AB Aims: There is controversy in published studies regarding the role of
   repeat whole brain radiation (WBRT) for previously irradiated brain
   metastases. The aim of our retrospective study was to document the
   practice at Princess Margaret Hospital with respect to the
   re-irraidiation of patients with progressive or recurrent brain
   metastatic disease after initial WBRT.
   Materials and methods: A comprehensive computerised database was used
   to identify patients treated for brain metastases with more than one
   course of WBRT between 1997 and 2003. Seventy-two patients were treated
   with WBRT for brain metastases and retreated with WBRT at a later date.
   The records of these patients were reviewed.
   Results: The median age was 56.5 years. The most common primary sites
   were lung (51 patients) and breast (17 patients). The most frequent
   dose used for the initial radiotherapy was 20Gy/5 fractions (62
   patients). The most common doses of re-irradiation were 25 Gy/10
   fractions (22 patients), 20 Gy/10 fractions (12 patients),
   15Gy/5fractions (11 patients) and 20 Gy/8 fractions (10 patients).
   Thirty-one per cent of patients experienced a partial clinical response
   after re-irradiation, as judged by follow-up clinical notes; 27%
   remained stable; 32% deteriorated after re-irradiation. Patients who
   had Eastern, Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 at the
   time of retreatment lived longer. In responders, the mean duration of
   response was 5.1 months. The median survival after re-irradiation was
   4.1 months. One patient was reported as having memory impairment and
   pituitary insufficiency after 5 months of progression-free survival.
   Conclusion: Repeat radiotherapy may be a useful treatment in carefully
   selected patients. With increased survival and better systemic. options
   for patients with metastatic disease, more patients may be candidates
   for consideration of repeat WBRT for recurrent brain metastases, but
   prospective studies are needed to more clearly document their outcomes.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to establish the diagnostic
   sensitivity of combinations of well-selected monoclonal antibodies
   (mAbs) against cardiac troponin I (cTnl) to allow an earlier rule-in of
   acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients.
   Design and methods: Using several combinations of mAbs, four new
   experimental cTnI immunoassays were evaluated to analyze plasma samples
   from 62 patients suffering from angina (16/62), patients having a chest
   pain of extracardiovascular origin (19/62) and ACS without ST elevation
   (NSTE-ACS) (27/62).
   Results: Assay 2, which relies on a capture mAb directed against the
   central part of cTnI and two conjugated mAbs directed against the N-ter
   region, provided the best clinical sensitivity. In 11 out of 27
   patients with NSTE-ACS, it detected an early rise of cTnI within 0 and
   I h upon admission, contributing to the detection of 53% of samples
   found to be negative by the reference AccuTnI Assay upon admission
   (Beckman Coulter), thereby reducing the delay in diagnosis.
   Conclusions: Assay 2 can identify early cTnI elevation in NSTE-ACS,
   possibly facilitating the rule-in procedure for these patients once the
   assay is automated. (c) 2007 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

ID DECISION-SUPPORT; MEDICAL DEVICES; TECHNOLOGY; CARE; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE
AB This article presents qualitative results collected 6 months after
   implementation of a clinical information system in four nursing homes
   in the Midwestern USA, Researchers explored initial implementation
   strategies, discussed employee experiences and analyzed employee
   satisfaction. Transcript-based analysis and axial coding were completed
   to illustrate recurring phenomena. Common attributes were identified by
   two gerontological nurse experts and a researcher with human factors
   expertise. Common themes emerging from 22 focus groups and direct
   observation of more than 120 nursing home staff were perception and
   cognition, change, workable systems, competence, and connectedness.
   Implementation strategies associated with lower satisfaction were
   availability of equipment, training resources, and the presence of
   information technology professionals. Initial clinical information
   system implementation strategies and employee satisfaction could be
   enhanced by the inclusion of a system life cycle charter plan,
   emphasizing change management procedures, improving start-up
   projections, hiring adequately trained information technology staff,
   and providing a system support plan. Findings will be useful to
   administrators and policy makers who are contemplating implementation
   of a clinical information system.

AB This paper argues that social reporting can be an important form of New
   Governance regulation to achieve stakeholder accountability. Current
   social reporting practices, however, fall short of achieving
   stakeholder accountability and actually may work against it. By
   examining the success and failures of other transparency programs in
   the United States, we can identify key factors for ensuring the success
   of social reporting over the long term. These factors include

TI The effect of chromatic dispersion on pseudophakic optical performance
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID YELLOW INTRAOCULAR-LENS; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; ABERRATION; VISION;
   LIGHT; EYES
AB Aim: Monochromatic and chromatic aberrations limit the visual
   performance of pseudophakic eyes. Chromatic aberration is caused by the
   chromatic dispersion of optical materials which can be characterised by
   their Abbe numbers. This study examines how chromatic dispersion
   affects pseudophakic optical performance at different wavelengths and
   spatial frequencies.
   Methods: Abbe numbers were measured for acrylic and silicone
   intraocular lenses (IOLs). A schematic eye model based on cataract
   population data was used to compute monochromatic and photopic
   polychromatic modulation transfer functions (MTFs) for pseudophakic
   eyes with aspheric IOLs. IOL Abbe numbers were varied without changing
   other eye model parameters to determine how chromatic dispersion
   affects pseudophakic MTF and chromatic difference of refraction.
   Additional calculations were performed for ( 1) acrylic or silicone
   materials and ( 2) high-pass optical filters blocking either UV
   radiation or UV radiation and short wavelength visible light.
   Results: Shorter wavelengths account for approximately two thirds of
   pseudophakic chromatic difference of refraction or longitudinal
   chromatic aberration. Increasing Abbe number ( reducing chromatic
   dispersion) decreases total chromatic difference of refraction and
   increases photopic polychromatic MTF. For a specific spatial frequency,
   there is an effective pseudophakic depth of wavelength over which a
   particular MTF level is achieved or exceeded. Depth of wavelength
   narrows with decreasing Abbe number or increasing spatial frequency.
   Blue-blocking IOL chromophores improve photopic MTF performance by less
   than 1.5%.
   Conclusions: Most pseudophakic longitudinal chromatic aberration arises
   from the chromatic dispersion of IOLs rather than the cornea and other
   ocular media. Increasing the Abbe number of optic materials improves
   overall pseudophakic optical performance. Optical transmission of
   medium and high spatial frequency modulation information has a spectrum
   similar to photopic luminous efficiency, accounting for the inability
   of blue-blocking chromophores to improve photopic pseudophakic contrast
   sensitivity significantly and demonstrating the excellent mutual
   adaptation of modulation transfer by the eye's optics and management of
   that data by the retina and brain.

AB The past three decades have brought major therapeutic advances in the
   management of acute promyelocytic leukemia. The current
   state-of-the-art induction treatment with all-trans retinoic acid in
   combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy results in
   long-lasting remissions and cure in up to 70% of newly diagnosed
   patients. Unfortunately, treatment failure still occurs in one-third of
   patients. When disease relapses, patients can achieve subsequent
   remissions with arsenic trioxide, all-trans retinoic acid with or
   without chemotherapy, or other therapies. Patients achieving molecular
   remissions after salvage therapy are generally considered candidates
   for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell
   transplantation as a postconsolidation strategy. On the other hand,
   patients with evidence of persistent hematologic or molecular disease
   after salvage therapy could be offered allogeneic hematopoietic
   transplantation if a suitable HLA-donor is identified and the patient's
   overall performance and clinical condition are permissible. We hereby
   provide a comprehensive review and analysis of published clinical
   trials that evaluate the role of hematopoietic cell transplantation
   across different stages of acute promyelocytic leukemia. (c) 2007

TI Laser micromachining for mould manufacturing: II. Manufacture and
   testing of mould inserts
SO ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION
LA English
DT Article
DE process management; material-removal processes; lasers
ID GENERATION
AB Purpose - Laser milling is a non-conventional layer-by-layer material
   removal technology suitable for machining a wide range of materials.
   This technology is particularly suitable to produce microstructures
   inside cavities, also obtained by other conventional processes, though
   with larger material removal rates, or for the direct development of
   microcavities not requiring high removal rates. This paper seeks to
   evaluate the capacity of laser milling for manufacturing of mould
   inserts.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper examined several specific
   features of laser milling, important for the manufacturing of mould
   inserts, such as walls verticality, unselected illuminating areas, due
   to an incorrect STL removal volume definition, aspiration process and
   orientation, to prevent welding of re-solidified particles on the
   surface. Two mould inserts were produced too, assembled on a metallic
   mould frame and tested with different injection conditions.
   Findings - The findings suggest that laser milling is a suitable
   technology to produce small mould insert for injection moulding, though
   injection conditions are different as one moves from macroscopic to
   microscopic injected parts. New design guidelines must be undertaken
   jointly with the assessment of laser milling performance to make mould
   microcavities. One of the major difficulties of this process is to keep
   the side walls vertical plus the generation of undesirable machined
   volumes, due to unselected illuminating areas below the STL volume,
   corresponding to the volume to be removed, whenever laser milling is
   used to operate with structures previously machined. To prevent welding
   of re-solidified particles on the surface a proper aspiration must also
   be considered.
   Originality/value - The paper describes the benefits of laser milling
   technology.

AB To further improve the technology used in Pacific oyster farming,
   information is required on the response of different sized and aged
   oysters to various environmental changes. In this study a neutral red
   retention (NRR) assay was used to investigate the effects of size and
   age on the response of Pacific oysters to changes in water temperature
   and their recovery after exposure to different air temperatures.
   Results from moving oysters directly between water temperatures of 5
   degrees C and 15 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C and 15
   degrees C and 25 degrees C demonstrated that different water
   temperature change affect the lysosomal membrane integrity differently.
   The NRR times of large and small oysters transferred directly between
   10 degrees C and 20 degrees C initially decreased significantly, and
   then increased to levels corresponding to the new temperature. In
   addition, NRR times in large oysters responded at a significantly
   slower rate than small oysters when they were transferred from 5
   degrees C and 25 degrees C to 15 degrees C water and between 10 degrees
   C and 20 degrees C water. Results from the air exposure experiments
   showed that, after exposure to air temperatures of 5 degrees C, 15
   degrees C or 25 degrees C, the lysosomal membrane integrity of large
   oysters recovered at a slower rate in 15 degrees C water compared to
   small oysters. It therefore appears necessary to develop different
   management strategies for large (old) and small (young) oysters.
   Results from this and previous research also indicate that the NRR
   assay could potentially be used to develop a model to monitor and
   predict the performance of oysters on farms.

AB Background: Significant interactions between abacavir and other
   antiretrovirals have not been reported. This study investigated the
   steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of abacavir when co-administered
   with atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir in HIV-infected
   individuals.
   Methods: HIV-infected subjects on abacavir (600 mg once daily) plus two
   nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (excluding
   tenofovir) underwent a 24 In pharmacokinetic assessment for plasma
   abacavir concentrations. Atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily;
   arm 1) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily; arm 2) were then
   added and the 24 h pharmacokinetic assessment repeated. Arm 3 included
   subjects stable on atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir and two
   NRTIs (excluding tenofovir or abacavir). These patients underwent a
   pharmacokinetic assessment for atazanavir/ritonavir or
   lopinavir/ritonavir concentrations on day 1, abacavir (600 mg once
   daily) was then added to the regimen and the pharmacokinetic assessment
   repeated. Within-subject changes in drug exposure were evaluated by
   geometric mean (GM) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: Twenty-four patients completed the study. GM (95% CI) abacavir
   area under the curve (AUC) was 18,621 (15,900-21,807) and 15,136
   (13,339-17,174) ng.h/ml without and with atazanavir/ritonavir and
   15,136 (12,298-18,628) and 10,471 (9,270-11,828) ng.h/ml without and
   with lopinavir/ritonavir. OM (95% CI) atazanavir AUC without and with
   abacavir was 26,915 (13,252-54,666) and 28,840 (19,213-43,291) ng.h/ml;
   lopinavir AUC without and with abacavir was 60,253 (48,084-75,509) and
   63,096 (48,128-82,718) ng.h/ml.
   Conclusions: No changes in atazanavir or lopinavir exposures were
   observed following the addition of abacavir; however, decreases in
   abacavir plasma exposure of 17% and 32% were observed following the
   addition of atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir, respectively.

AB Background High-reliability organizations have stressed the importance
   of nontechnical skills for safety and of regularly providing such
   training to their teams. Recently safety skills training has been
   applied in the practice of medicine. In this study, we developed and
   piloted a module using multidisciplinary crisis scenarios in a
   simulated operating theatre to train entire surgical teams.
   Methods Twenty teams participated (n = 80); each consisted of a trainee
   surgeon, anesthetist, operating department practitioner (ODP), and
   scrub nurse. Crisis scenarios such as difficult intubation, hemorrhage,
   or cardiac arrest were simulated. Technical and nontechnical skills
   (leadership, communication, team skills, decision making, and
   vigilance), were assessed by clinical experts and by two psychologists
   using relevant technical and human factors rating scales. Participants
   received technical and nontechnical feedback, and the whole team
   received feedback on teamwork.
   Results Trainees assessed the training favorably. For technical skills
   there were no differences between surgical trainees' assessment scores
   and the assessment scores of the trainers. However, nurses overrated
   their technical skill. Regarding nontechnical skills, leadership and
   decision making were scored lower than the other three nontechnical
   skills (communication, team skills, and vigilance). Surgeons scored
   lower than nurses on communication and teamwork skills. Surgeons and
   anesthetists scored lower than nurses on leadership.
   Conclusions Multidisciplinary simulation-based team training is
   feasible and well received by surgical teams. Nontechnical skills can
   be assessed alongside technical skills, and differences in performance
   indicate where there is a need for further training. Future work should
   focus on developing team performance measures for training and on the
   development and evaluation of systematic training for technical and
   nontechnical skills to enhance team performance and safety in surgery.

AB Assessment of hepatic fibrosis is important for determining prognosis,
   guiding management decisions, and monitoring disease. Histological
   evaluation of liver biopsy specimens is currently considered the
   reference test for staging hepatic fibrosis. Since liver biopsy carries
   a small but significant risk, noninvasive tests to assess hepatic
   fibrosis are desirable. This editorial gives an overview on noninvasive
   methods currently available to determine hepatic fibrosis and their
   diagnostic accuracy for predicting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis
   in chronic hepatitis C. Based on available data, the performance of
   simple tests derived from routine laboratory parameters appears to be
   similar to that of more complex and expensive fibrosis panels.
   Transient elastography seems more accurate than blood tests for
   diagnosing cirrhosis.

AB Channel management aims to provide quality of service guarantees for
   mobile users while efficiently utilize limited radio spectrum. With the
   increasing demand for diverse services in wireless networks, channel
   management for multi-service traffic in wireless networks is important.
   To provide diverse broadband services in limited radio spectrum,
   previous literature has presented adaptive services which provide
   mobile users with good quality of services. This study considers
   channel management for multi-service traffic in wireless networks with
   adaptive services. A channel management scheme, namely, restricted
   sharing, is devised to provide multi-class traffic with quality of
   service guarantees while increase channel utilization as much as
   possible. An analysis is used to study the performance of the
   restricted sharing scheme. Three classes are considered in numerical
   results. Numerical results show that the restricted sharing scheme
   guarantees quality of service and achieves high channel utilization.

TI Model T: A model for user registration patterns based on campus WLAN
   data
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE mobility models; registration models; wireless LAN
AB We discuss the derivation of an empirical model for spatial
   registration patterns of mobile users in a campus wireless local area
   network (WLAN). Such a model can be very useful in a variety of
   simulation studies of the performance of mobile wireless systems, such
   as that of resource management and mobility management protocols. We
   base the model on extensive experimental data from a campus WiFi LAN
   installation. We divide the empirical data available to us into
   training and test data sets, develop the model based on the training
   set, and evaluate it against the test set.
   The model shows that user registration patterns exhibit a distinct
   hierarchy, and that WLAN access points (APs) can be clustered based on
   registration patterns. Cluster size distributions are highly skewed, as
   are intra-cluster transition probabilities and trace lengths, which can
   all be modeled well by the heavy-tailed Weibull distribution. The
   fraction of popular APs in a cluster, as a function of cluster size,
   can be modeled by exponential distributions. There is general
   similarity across hierarchies, in that inter-cluster registration
   patterns tend to have the same characteristics and distributions as
   intra-cluster patterns. In this context, we also introduce and discuss
   the modeling of the disconnected state as an integral part of real
   traffic characteristics.
   We generate synthetic traffic traces based on the model we derive. We
   then compare these traces against the real traces from the test set
   using a set of metrics we define. We find that the synthetic traces
   agree very well with the test set in terms of the metrics. We compare
   the derived model to a simple modified random waypoint model, and show
   that the latter is not at all representative of the real data. We also
   show how the model parameters can be varied to allow designers to
   consider 'what-if' scenarios easily. Finally we develop an extended
   version of Model T that uses an alternative modeling of relative
   popularity of APs and clusters, with certain generalization advantages,
   and evaluate its fidelity to the real data also, with positive results.

TI Self-management in chaotic wireless deployments
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the past few years, wireless networking technologies have made
   vast forays into our daily lives. Today, one can find 802.11 hardware
   and other personal wireless technology employed at homes, shopping
   malls, coffee shops and airports. Present-day wireless network
   deployments bear two important properties: they are unplanned, with
   most access points (APs) deployed by users in a spontaneous manner,
   resulting in highly variable AP densities; and they are unmanaged,
   since manually configuring and managing a wireless network is very
   complicated. We refer to such wireless deployments as being chaotic.
   In this paper, we present a study of the impact of interference in
   chaotic 802.11 deployments on end-client performance. First, using
   large-scale measurement data from several cities, we show that it is
   not uncommon to have tens of APs deployed in close proximity of each
   other. Moreover, most APs are not configured to minimize interference
   with their neighbors. We then perform trace-driven simulations to show
   that the performance of end-clients could suffer significantly in
   chaotic deployments. We argue that end-client experience could be
   significantly improved by making chaotic wireless networks
   self-managing. We design and evaluate automated power control and rate
   adaptation algorithms to minimize interference among neighboring APs,
   while ensuring robust end-client performance.

TI A mobile bazaar for wide-area wireless services
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB We introduce MoB, an infrastructure for collaborative wide-area
   wireless data services. MoB proposes to change the current model of
   data services in the following fundamental ways: (1) it decouples
   infrastructure providers from services providers and enables
   fine-grained competition, (2) it allows service interactions on
   arbitrary timescales, and, (3) it promotes flexible composition of
   these fine-grained service interactions based on user and application
   needs. At the heart of MoB is an open market architecture in which
   mobile users can opportunistically trade various services with each
   other in a flexible manner. In this paper we first describe the overall
   architecture of MoB including various enablers like user reputation
   management, incentive management, and accounting services. We next
   present our experience from both simulations as well as our prototype
   implementation of MoB in enhancing application performance in multiple
   different scenarios-file transfers, web browsing, media streaming, and
   location-enhanced services.

ID PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; WEED MANAGEMENT; ALLELOPATHY
AB The various organs of the Polish cultivars of buckwheat were evaluated
   for their flavonoid content (rutin, quercetin, (+)-catechin, and
   (-)-epicatechin) and for their phenolic acid content (chlorogenic,
   caffeic, ferulic, and gallic acids) to test their contribution to
   buckwheat allelopathic activity. The main compound found in the
   above-ground organs of buckwheat was rutin, followed by chlorogenic
   acid, and then (-)-epicatechin. The allelopathic activity, based on the
   specific activity of the identified compounds on lettuce seedling
   growth, was evaluated. Gallic acid had the highest specific activity
   and quercetin had the lowest. The specific activity of rutin was at the
   medium level compared to the other examined compounds, but as a
   consequence of its high concentration, its total activity was very
   high. The growth inhibitory effects of the aqueous extracts of the
   buckwheat leaves and inflorescences were higher than that of the stems.
   The higher inhibitory activity of the extracts compared to the leaves
   and inflorescences was explained by the high presence of rutin in them.
   Therefore, based on the total activity, as calculated by its
   concentration and its growth inhibitory effect, it seems that rutin,
   among the other tested compounds, is the major allelochemical in Polish
   buckwheat.

AB The present paper describes the development, performance and
   conclusions derived from three know-how and technology transfer
   projects to South American countries. The first project comprised a
   collaborative study by European and South American universities to find
   sustainable solutions for Chilean and Ecuadorian leather tanneries
   which had underachieving process performances. The second project
   consisted of investigations carried out in a Brazilian municipality to
   enhance its municipal solid waste management system. The final
   collaborative programme dealt with the initial identification,
   evaluation and registration of suspected contaminated sites in an
   industrial region of Chile. The detailed objectives, methods and
   procedures applied as well as the results and conclusions obtained in
   each of the three mentioned projects are presented, giving special
   attention to the organizational aspects and to the practical approach
   of each programme, concluding with their main advantages and
   disadvantages for identifying a set of qualitative and quantitative
   suggestions, and to establish transferable methods for future
   applications.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the use of a
   manually operated needle remover on sharps-waste management practices
   in clinical settings in India - specifically, evaluating its
   acceptability and performance.
   Thirty-one Balcan Mini-Destructor needle removers were introduced into
   seven health facilities in two cities in India - Delhi and Jaipur. One
   hundred and nineteen health workers, including auxiliary nurse
   midwives, nurses, and laboratory staff, used the device. Data were
   prospectively collected by observation and interview on device usage,
   malfunction and acceptability over a 23-week period. Focus group
   discussions on current practices were conducted prior to study
   initiation and, after completion, on device acceptability and
   performance.
   The manual needle remover was well accepted. Devices were seen as easy
   to use and durable. In total, 88,719 needles were removed.
   In conclusion, the needle-remover device was considered an acceptable
   method of preventing needle reuse and isolating infectious sharps waste
   in clinical settings.

ID YAM
AB A research farm at University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria, which was
   under cultivation for > 25 years before it was fallowed for 8 years,
   was cleared in 1998 and grown to three common crop mixtures for 4
   years. The aim was to assess the performance of the cassava component
   in terms of root yield and harvest index under continuous cultivation
   relative to soil nutrient variations. The crop mixtures were cassava +
   pigeonpea, cassava + pigeonpea + maize, and cassava + pigeonpea + maize
   + yam. Incorporation of crop residues from each of the respective plots
   into the soils and the use of a legume (pigeonpea) served as means of
   restoring soil fertility. The experimental design was a randomized
   complete block design replicated thrice each year. Changes in eight
   selected soil fertility indicators, namely, pH, total N, organic
   matter, available P, and exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, and Na were monitored
   for the period. An analysis of the nutrient contents of the soils under
   the crop mixtures indicated narrow variations over the four years,
   except in the cases of exchangeable cations where coefficients of
   variations of >= 25% were obtained. Comparatively, year-to-year
   variations were more substantial though not consistent. This is because
   in some years some nutrients decreased while others increased relative
   to the values obtained in the preceding year. Except in 1999 when
   cassava root yields from all the crop mixtures decreased substantially
   (> 60%) relative to their 1998 respective values, the trends in other
   years were not consistent in all the crop mixtures. The mean yields
   obtained were generally below the expected mean yield for the same
   cassava variety in the area. The study also showed that all the soil
   parameters selected contributed to the variations in cassava yields,
   though they were not consistent in each year and in each crop mixture.
   However, regression analysis between the relative changes in soil
   nutrients and cassava yield variations showed significant contributions
   of total N (P = 0.05), exchangeable Ca. (P = 0.01), and Mg (P = 0.001).
   Thus, adequate management of these soil factors is required to enhance
   the performance of cassava in the crop mixtures.

AB A study was conducted at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute's
   National Animal Husbandry Research Centre, Naivasha, Kenya, to
   characterize the growth pattern of three parental lines of local
   chicken, Nyeri, Kericho, Taita, and a cross of Rhode Island Red with
   Nyeri. A total of 468 straight-run day-old chicks was used. Feed and
   water were provided ad libitum and the birds weighed individually on a
   weekly basis for 20 weeks. A non-linear growth model (Gompertz) was
   used to analyze the collected data which was summarized in three
   parameters, A, B, and K for both male and female birds. A statistical
   analysis of residuals was carried out to determine the best-fitted
   model. The pattern of growth showed little difference between the sexes
   up to the age of about 10 weeks, before the male birds started to gain
   more weight than the females in subsequent weeks. The male birds
   attained higher final (asymptotic) weight A than their female
   counterparts, although they both had similar initial weight (log A-B).
   The female birds had higher values of K (constant of rate of growth)
   which resulted in earlier maturation. The Nyeri line was superior to
   other indigenous tines. The Taita males were slightly larger than those
   of Kericho, but the latter's females exhibited better values than the
   former. Crossing indigenous chicken with a dual-purpose exotic breed
   improved growth performance under station management. For both male and
   female birds, a fitted model with constant B and K and varying A was
   found to be acceptable.

ID PROCESS ALGEBRA; SYSTEMS; SPECIFICATION; PERFORMANCE
AB The Temporal Mobile Stochastic Logic (MoSL) has been introduced in
   previous work by the authors for formulating properties of systems
   specified in SToKLAIM, a Markovian extension of KLAIM. The main purpose
   of MOSL is to address key functional aspects of global computing such
   as distribution awareness, mobility, and security and their integration
   with performance and dependability guarantees. In this paper, we
   present MoSL+, an extension of MOSL, which incorporates some basic
   features of the Modal Logic for Mobility (MOMO), a logic specifically
   designed for dealing with resource management and mobility aspects of
   concurrent behaviours. We also show how MOSL+ formulae can be
   model-checked against STOKLAIM specifications. For this purpose, we
   show how existing state-based stochastic model-checkers, like e.g. the
   Markov Reward Model Checker (MRMC), can be exploited by using a
   front-end for STOKLAIM that performs appropriate pre-processing of
   MOSL+ formulae. The proposed approach is illustrated by modelling and
   verifying a sample system. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common sporting injury,
   often managed surgically with patella-tendon or hamstrings-gracilis
   autograft. Some people who sustain the injury, request information
   about their prognosis if they choose to forgo surgery and opt for
   conservative management. Numerous studies provide data on the prognosis
   of conservatively managed ACL injuries. These studies have not been
   systematically reviewed. Thus, the aims of this systematic review are
   to describe the natural history and clinical course of function and
   proprioception in the conservatively managed ACL-deficient knee, and to
   identify prognostic factors. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE,
   SportDiscus, PEDro and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials
   without language restrictions from the earliest record available up to
   July 2006. We also searched the Science Citation Index, and iteratively
   searched bibliographies for prospective studies of outcomes (> 6 months
   follow-up) of conservatively managed complete ACL tears. Six criteria
   were used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The
   main outcome measures were self-reported measures of knee function,
   activity level, performance in functional tasks and knee
   proprioception. Fifteen studies of variable methodological quality were
   included in the review. On average, patients with mixed or isolated
   ACL-deficient knees reported good knee function (87/100 Lysholm knee
   scale) at follow-up duration of 12-66 months. On average, functional
   performance assessed with the hop-for-distance test, was in the normal
   range. From pre-injury to follow-up there was a reduction in Tegner
   activity level of 21.3%. According to the methods used in the assessed
   studies, conservatively managed ACL-deficient knees have a good short-
   to mid-term prognosis in terms of self-reported knee function and
   functional performance. However, subjects reduced their activity levels
   on average by 21% following injury.

SO SPE PRODUCTION & OPERATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The BP-operated Miller Field poses a unique chemical challenge as it
   has. arguably, the harshest oilfield scaling regime in the North Sea,
   if not the world. Some 3 million litres of chemical are consumed each
   year and the management, supply, use, and performance of every aliquot
   of chemical is imperative to see Miller through to its planned
   cessation of production.
   The Miller Field is a mature North Sea asset and produces a potential
   of 80,000 BWPD with its 16,000 BOPD. The unique challenge posed by
   Miller is that the produced water contains very high concentrations of
   scale-forming components combined with a very high corrosivity
   potential. Chemicals are routinely deployed to control scale,
   corrosion, emulsions, foam, biological fouling, and hydrates.
   Two major step changes have occurred in the past 12 months that have
   delivered significant improvement to chemical management processes. The
   first step is the use of a novel, best-in-class, scale-inhibitor
   chemistry. Two years were spent in an industry-wide search as well as
   developing and extensively testing the chemical in the laboratory. The
   new chemical is now deployed on more than 75% of the Miller wells. The
   longevity of scale-prevention treatments has been doubled on some wells
   when compared to the incumbent products.
   The second step change was the application of innovative relative
   permeability modifier chemistries that not only increase oil production
   but actually shut off water production. Cross-linked polymer gels are
   pumped down wells and inflate in the presence of water. effectively
   blocking the flow path, but deflate in the presence of oil, allowing
   flow.
   By implementing these changes, significant steps have been taken toward
   ensuring that continuation of production to the proposed cessation of
   production remains a viable proposition.

AB Oseberg Sor field, operated by Hydro Oil & Energy, is situated 130 km
   west of the Norwegian coast on the eastern flank of the Viking Graben
   structure. It comprises a sequence of fault-bounded structural units of
   varying geological complexity. Within these units, the reservoir
   intervals are of moderate to poor quality and can exhibit strong
   contrasts in permeability and formation water composition. Reservoir
   support is provided by combined injection of gas and Utsira aquifer

   Detailed scale predictions have been performed to identify the scaling
   risk for each producer. From these, it was identified that the major
   risk to well performance and integrity was CaCO3 precipitation in the
   upper tubing with potential failure of the downhole safety valve. The
   risk varied from negligible to severe and reflected the variable
   composition of the produced water and well operating conditions. The
   scale predictions provided the basis for a technical and economic
   evaluation to identify an appropriate scale-management strategy for
   Oseberg Sor. For those wells completed with downhole chemical injection
   lines, the option to use these for scale inhibition was considered cost
   effective. In other wells where this option was not available, scale
   inhibitor injection into the gas lift system or squeezing using a
   viscosified treatment was considered viable.
   The paper will provide the technical and economic reasoning for the
   scale-management strategy selected along with field case histories for
   each treatment type (i.e., experience with treatment using chemical
   injection lines, injection of scale inhibitor into the,gas lift system,
   and squeezing).

AB The data used for this study were collected on 16 644 kids born between
   2000 and 2004 in 12 different Angora goat studs representing different
   management systems. Body weight and growth rate of kids from birth to
   16 months of age, as well the 18- and 21-month body weights and first
   kidding performance of ewe kids were evaluated. Variable growth rates
   were recorded among kids in the different studs, which can be ascribed
   largely to different environments and supplementary feeding practices.
   The pre-weaning growth performance of both ram and ewe kids was
   satisfactory. However, the same did not apply for post-weaning growth
   rates. In those flocks where kids did not receive any supplementary
   feeding after weaning, their body weights remained virtually constant
   from weaning up to eight months of age. This phenomenon where
   especially ewe kids did not grow well after weaning, needs to be
   investigated further, since it influences the reproductive ability of
   young ewes directly. This was evident from the poor reproductive
   performance of young ewes in some of the studs. On the other hand, the
   effect of different pre-weaning treatments did not seem to be carried
   over to body weight and reproductive performance at first kidding age.

AB A survey was organized to study the semi-intensive system of sheep
   farming in the island of Crete and examine possibilities of improvement
   by means of technical intervention. Thirty-nine farms with a total
   number of 7362 sheep were studied in seven areas of Crete. Various
   parameters were assessed related to management, flock performance, as
   well as quantity and quality of milk produced. Ewe fertility, births
   and lambs weaned were recorded. In addition, milk yield and variables
   related to milk quality such as somatic cell counts and total microbial
   flora were measured. Technical intervention aimed at removing
   non-productive animals of the flock, programming matings, balancing
   rations, managing grazing more efficiently and preventing diseases. As
   a result, ewe fertility and numbers of lambs weaned were significantly
   improved, whereas harvested milk and milk quality were also improved.
   It is expected that information obtained from this study will enrich
   our knowledge of the dairy sheep farming systems in the Mediterranean
   countries and elsewhere. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE real-time systems; Java virtual machine; memory management; ownership
   types
AB Real-time systems are notoriously difficult to design and implement,
   and, as many real-time problems are safety-critical, their solutions
   must be reliable as well as efficient and correct. While higher-level
   programming models (such as the Real-Time Specification for Java)
   permit real-time programmers to use language features that most
   programmers take for granted (objects, type checking, dynamic dispatch,
   and memory safety) the compromises required for real-time execution,
   especially concerning memory allocation, can create as many problems as
   they solve. This paper presents Scoped Types and Aspects for Real-Time
   Systems (STARS) a novel programming model for real-time systems. Scoped
   Types give programmers a clear model of their programs' memory use,
   and, being statically checkable, prevent the run-time memory errors
   that bedevil the RTSJ. Adopting the integrated Scoped Types and Aspects
   approach can significantly improve both the quality and performance of
   a real-time Java systems, resulting in simpler systems that are
   reliable, efficient, and correct.

ID UNITED-STATES; HEALTH-CARE; QUALITY; RISK; COMPLICATIONS; SETTINGS
AB Background: Diabetes care in our inner-city primary care clinic was
   suboptimal, despite provider education and performance feedback
   targeting improved adherence to evidence-based clinical guidelines. A
   crew resource management (CRM) intervention (communication and
   teamwork, process and workflow organisation, and standardised
   information debriefings) was implemented to improve diabetes care and
   patient outcomes.
   Objective: To assess the effect of the CRM intervention on adherence to
   evidence-based diabetes care standards, work processes, standardised
   clinical communication and patient outcomes.
   Methods: Time-series analysis was used to assess the effect on the
   delivery of standard diabetes services and patient outcomes among
   medically indigent adults (n = 619).
   Results: The CRM principles were translated into useful process
   redesign and standardised care approaches. Significant improvements in
   microalbumin testing and associated patient outcome measures were
   attributed to the intervention.
   Conclusions: The CRM approach provided tools for management that, in
   the short term, enabled reorganisation and prevention of service
   omissions and, in the long term, can produce change in the
   organisational culture for continuous improvement.

AB Background: Outpatient healthcare organisations worldwide participate
   in quality improvement (QI) programmes. Despite the importance of
   understanding the financial impact of such programmes, there are no
   established standard methods for empirically assessing QI programme
   costs and their consequences for small outpatient healthcare
   organisations.
   Objective and methods: The costs and cost consequences were evaluated
   for a diabetes QI programme implemented throughout the USA in federally
   qualified community health centres. For five case study centres, survey
   instruments and methods for data analysis were developed.
   Results: Two types of cost/revenue were evaluated. Direct
   costs/revenues, such as personnel time, items purchased and grants
   received, were evaluated using self- administered surveys. Cost/revenue
   consequences, which were cost/revenue changes that may have occurred
   due to changes in patient utilisation or physician behaviour, were
   evaluated using electronic billing data. Other methods for evaluating
   cost/revenue consequences if electronic billing data are not available
   are also discussed.
   Conclusion: This paper describes a practical taxonomy and method for
   assessing the costs and revenues of QI programmes for outpatient
   organisations. Results of such analyses will be useful for healthcare
   organisations implementing QI programmes and also for policy makers
   designing incentives for QI participation.

DE PV-diesel hybrid systems; rural electrification
ID RURAL ELECTRIFICATION; PUMPING SYSTEMS; LESSONS
AB In October 2002, under the auspices of Spanish Cooperation, a pilot
   electrification project put into operation two centralised PV-diesel
   hybrid systems in two different Moroccan villages. These systems
   currently provide a full-time energy service and supply electricity to
   more than a hundred of families, six community buildings, street
   lighting and one running water system. The appearance of the
   electricity service is very similar to an urban one: one phase AC
   supply (230 V/50 Hz) distributed up to each dwelling using a
   low-voltage mini-grid, which has been designed to be fully compatible
   with a future arrival of the utility grid. The management of this
   electricity service is based on a 'fee-for-service' scheme agreed
   between a local NGO, partner of the project, and electricity
   associations created in each village, which are in charge of, among
   other tasks, recording the daily energy production of systems and the
   monthly energy consumption of each house. This register of data allows
   a systematic evaluation of both the system performance and the energy

TI Customer-supplier relationship management in an intelligent supply

ID ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; FIRMS
AB Outsourcing is leading to more and more complex industrial
   organisations. This can be attributed to the fact that several decision
   centres interact. As a consequence, changes in customer-supplier
   relationships can be noticed. In recent years, these relations have
   strongly evolved to lead to better internal management of each partner
   and a better general performance to satisfy customers. These evolutions
   created a new approach to the relationship between companies, called
   'industrial partnership', in the form of a network. Networks induce a
   need at customer-supplier relation control level. The contribution and
   participation of each of the partners are thus fundamental to make
   supply chain management (SCM) a successful project. The control system
   of each actor partner must thus be adaptable enough to satisfy the
   production requirements. Our contribution to the improvement of
   customer-supplier relationship is a decentralised self-organised
   control model based on the concept of holon. In this model, the
   decision system manages a group of actors' operations who are in a
   partnership. In this paper in particular a process for the evaluation
   of the suppliers network is discussed.

DE responsiveness; coordination; volatility; supply chain planning; toy
   industry
ID SEASONAL PRODUCTS; MANAGEMENT; DEMAND; SALES; ORDER
AB Demands for innovative products in short selling windows are highly
   unpredictable. This volatility creates demands with dramatic peaks and
   troughs due to risk-avoidance behaviours among manufacturers and
   retailers. The consequences are high obsolete inventory, lost sales,
   and markdowns. Theoretically, the concepts of quick response and
   postponement are among the potential solutions for such as a volatile
   and seasonal toy supply chain. This study explores the role of
   responsiveness and coordination in improving supply chain performance.
   It is based on an in-depth case study in a European toy supply chain.
   Consumer and retailer demand patterns and their implications to the
   manufacturer's supply chains are analysed. Opportunities for relocating
   order penetration points (OPP) and quick response are simulated, and
   appropriate relocation rules are established. It is concluded that OPP
   relocation and responsiveness are beneficial but inadequate in
   improving the supply chain. Coordination of ordering behaviours is
   necessary. Coordination processes to achieve greater performance
   between the toy manufacturer and two of its retailers are presented.
   Furthermore, the concept of 'coordinated responsiveness' is proposed,
   which combines the concepts of quick response, accurate response and
   coordination.

AB Supply chain coordination (SCC) is an effective approach to improve
   supply chain (SC) performance. The coordination can be achieved when
   interdependent entities work together by sharing resources and
   information to achieve common objectives aligned to maximise customer
   value for the entire SC. There are a number of mechanisms by which the
   SC members can coordinate, e. g. contracts, information sharing,
   information technology and collaborative initiatives. To communicate
   frequently and effectively, the partners are required to have good
   information systems and capability to share information. To coordinate
   with each other the SC members are required to have capabilities to
   implement coordination mechanisms effectively. In this paper, a model
   is proposed to measure the effect of these mechanisms on the extent of
   coordination. Currently, there is no scale of measurement reported in
   the literature to measure the SCC. A fuzzy logic approach combined with
   the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed to evaluate the extent
   of coordination. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through a
   case study of an automotive parts manufacturer.

AB Supply chain excellence has a real impact on business strategy.
   Building supply chains as flexible systems represents one of the most
   exciting opportunities to create value and one of the most challenging
   tasks for the policy makers. It requires integrated decision making
   amongst autonomous chain partners with effective decision knowledge
   sharing between them. The key to success lies in knowing which decision
   has more impact on the overall performance and this can be achieved by
   appropriate knowledge sharing. In this context, knowledge management (
   KM) can be used as an effective approach to achieve knowledge sharing
   and decision synchronisation in supply chains. Flexible supply chains
   (FSCs) are more complex and involve multiple autonomous players with
   varying technical cultures ( affects knowledge mindsets), managerial
   background ( affects decision knowledge) and supply chain management
   (SCM) exposures ( affects knowledge sharing attitudes). Thus there is a
   need to develop demo models that can encourage chain managers towards
   collaborative knowledge sharing in the supply chains. This paper
   presents the application of one such model based on decision knowledge
   sharing (DKS) for improved supply chain management. A simulation model
   of a flexible supply chain based on DKS framework is developed for demo
   purposes. The key results are highlighted along with industry
   implications. The cost based performance of DKS at different levels of
   flexibility is studied. Thus a careful analysis of the chain with a
   focus on collaborative decisions is useful to ensure success. This
   paper addresses this interesting and challenging domain.

AB This paper investigates how information management ( IM) and
   information technology ( IT) can support supply chain management (
   SCM). The objective is to develop a methodology for the alignment of
   all activities, which relate to IM in supply chains with supply chain
   targets in order to optimally support SCM. Following the Axiomatic
   design method, supply chain design decomposition is developed that
   distinguishes objectives and means of SCM at different levels. Results
   show that IM has an impact on all target areas of SCM, i. e. quality,
   delivery reliability, delivery lead times, flexibility, assets, and
   costs. The methodology can be used to identify appropriate measures
   related to IM and IT for a specific target area as well as to assess
   their contribution to the corporate strategy of a company and the
   supply chain targets. Furthermore, interdependencies and prerequisites
   can be analysed. In particular, information quality must first be
   established. Two short case studies illustrate the application of the
   methodology.

AB Typical supply chains can be characterised by their complexity and by
   the inherent uncertainty in their operations. Modelling such supply
   chains would allow for analysis of the system; however, this is a
   difficult task both in practice and research. This paper proposes a
   generalisable network based methodology to model supply chain
   operations and the uncertainty of system attributes such as lead time
   and cost. The methodology represents the operation of a supply chain as
   a high- level network and allows for the inclusion of stochastic
   variables so that uncertainty in the operation of a supply chain can be
   modelled and analysed in order to implement changes to improve overall
   system performance. The use of the methodology is illustrated on an
   industry application.

AB Fabry disease is a rare and underrecognized disease associated with an
   altered X-linked gene controlling hydrolase alphagalactosidase A
   activity This mutation impairs the glycosphingolipid metabolism.
   A multisystemic disease with a highly variable clinical presentation,
   its principal symptom is acroparesthesia. Manifestations of Fabry
   disease occur mostly in hemizygous moles but also in heterozygous
   females.
   Before enzyme replacement therapy was available, lite expectancy was
   about So years in men and 70 years in women.
   Early diagnosis is essential to prevent irreversible organ damage.
   Diagnosis is based on on assay of alpha-galactosidase A activity in
   mole patients and on genetic analysis in female patients.
   Prognosis is related principally to three complications: involvement of
   the central nervous system, kidneys, and heart.
   Management of Fabry patients should in all cases combine symptomatic
   therapy and regular clinical, laboratory and morphological follow-up by
   specialists in genetic metabolic diseases.
   Enzyme replacement therapy should be considered in all adult mole
   patients and should probably begin early In adult heterozygous female
   patients and in children, this treatment should be considered only for
   patients with severe pain, argon damage, or central nervous system,
   kidney or heart involvement.
   After a proband is identified, a genealogical tree should be used to
   identify other affected members of the family.

AB Climatic seasonality, local habitat quality, and edge effects created
   by forest fragmentation due to human activity may affect the
   performance of endangered rain forest under-story herbs. Viability and
   seasonal dynamics of the populations of the endangered Saintpaidia
   confusa, S. difficilis, and S. grotei were studied in a protected
   seasonal submontane forest in NE Tanzania by examining plant
   life-history traits, population stage structure, and the effects of
   habitat quality on plant performance. The population stage structures
   were of the dynamic type. There was a lower frequency of seedlings
   (57.9%) and higher frequency of juvenile (13.3%) and adult plants
   (28.8%) in S. confusa than in S. difficilis (74%, 10.7% and 15.3%,
   respectively). Seedling, recruitment occurred from May to August with
   an average of 54, 103 and 38 emerged seedlings per 1 m(2) study plot
   (S. confusa. S. difficilis, and S. grotei, respectively). Presence of
   the seed bank was also an indication of the regeneration potential of
   the populations. Mortality was high during the dry and hot season from
   December to March. Survival was lowest in juvenile plants, higher in
   sterile adult plants and the highest in fertile adult plants. Because
   survival was the lowest on dry substrates under open canopy, our data
   suggest that forest fragmentation, by reducing shade and humidity, will
   increase mortality in Saintpaulia. Furthermore, since the mortality was
   highest in seedlings and juveniles, forest fragmentation is likely to
   impede the regeneration of the Saintpaulia populations.

AB Severity of toxoplasmosis is highly correlated to the immune status of
   the infected individual. Foetus and immunocompromised patient are
   mostly at risk to develop life threatening forms. In this situation,
   serological diagnosis gives poor information. DNA detection using
   polymerase-chain-reaction technology (PCR) has significantly improved
   the management of this disease. Even so, the growing number of
   conventional PCR assays has finally led to variable performance
   results. Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) in toxoplasmosis has been developed
   since 2000. This new technology can improve standardisation. Moreover,
   quantification of parasitic load in samples becomes possible. This
   review describes the main RT-PCR procedures actually under use and the
   studies comparing different target genes. The effective benefit of
   quantification is also discussed. Reducing number of procedures and
   more systematic external quality control should be considered, in order
   to improve reliability in PCR results, which has undoubtedly become a
   major tool in toxoplasmosis diagnosis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Service address routing: a network-embedded resource management layer
   for cluster computing
SO PARALLEL COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE distributed resource discovery; service address routing; intelligent
   interconnection networks
AB Service address routing is introduced as a novel and powerful paradigm
   for the integration of resource management functions into the
   interconnection fabric of cluster computers. SAR provides a "location
   independent" mechanism for the distribution of computations (services)
   among the computational resources of the cluster. The intelligence to
   allocate services and, later on, invoke their instantiation is embedded
   into intelligent switching devices [Isaac D. Scherson, C.-K. Chien,
   Least common ancestor networks, VLSI Design 2(4) (1995) 353-364].
   Invocation of services is effected transparently to requesting nodes by
   these network-embedded management functions. Thus, applications can
   benefit from the inherent parallelism of the cluster while being
   totally unaware of the specific "location" where required services are
   rendered. The performance of SAR's service discovery mechanism in
   hierarchical Least Common Ancestor Networks is studied by means of
   simulating two different system configurations: level-global knowledge
   and Level Caches. It is shown that searches using Level Caches work
   better than level-global knowledge for a typical scientific computing
   workload. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID IMPLEMENTATION
AB The Grid Information Service (GIS) is a core component in the Grid
   software infrastructure. It provides diverse information to users or
   other service components in Grid environments. In this paper, we
   propose a scalable GIS architecture for information management in a
   large scale Grid Virtual Organization (VO). This architecture consists
   of the VO layer, site layer and resource layer: at the resource layer,
   information agents and pluggable information sensors are deployed on
   each resource monitored. This information agent and sensor approach
   provides a flexible framework that enables specific information to be
   captured; at the site layer, a site information service component with
   caching capability aggregates and maintains up-to-date information of
   all the resources monitored within an administrative domain, at the VO
   layer, a peer-to-peer approach is used to build a virtual network of
   site information services for information discovery and query in a
   large scale Grid VO. This decentralized approach makes information
   management scalable and robust. Furthermore, we propose a security
   framework for the GIS, which provide security policies for
   authentication and authorization control of the GIS at both the site
   and the VO layers. Our GIS has been implemented based on the Globus
   Toolkit 4 as Web services compliant to Web Services Resource Framework
   (WSRF) specifications. The experimental results show that the GIS
   presents satisfactory scalability in handling information for large
   scale Grids. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Use of a paraffin-based grout to stabilize buried beryllium and other
   wastes
SO NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE beryllium; WAXFIX; waste
ID SOIL
AB The long-term durability of WAXFIX, a paraffin-based grout, was
   evaluated for in situ grouting of activated beryllium wastes in the
   subsurface disposal area (SDA), a radioactive landfill at the
   Radioactive Waste Management Complex, part of the Idaho National
   Laboratory (INL). The evaluation considered radiological and biological
   mechanisms that could degrade the grout using data from an extensive
   literature search and previous tests of in situ grouting at the INL.
   Conservative radioactive doses for WAXFIX were calculated from the
   "hottest" (i.e., highest-activity) Advanced Test Reactor beryllium
   block in the SDA. These results indicate that WAXFIX would not
   experience extensive radiation damage for many hundreds of years.
   Calculation of radiation-induced hydrogen generation in WAXFIX
   indicated that grout physical performance should not be reduced beyond
   the effects of radiation dose on the molecular structure. Degradation
   of a paraffin-based grout by microorganisms in the SDA is possible and
   perhaps likely, but the rate of degradation will be at a slower rate
   than found in the literature reviewed. The calculations showed the
   outer 0.46-m (18-in.) layer of each monolith, which represents the
   minimum expected distance to the beryllium block, was calculated to
   require 1000 to 3600yr to be consumed. The existing data and
   estimations of biodegradation and radiolysis rates for WAXFIX/paraffin
   do not indicate any immediate problems with the use of WAXFIX for
   grouting beryllium or other wastes in the SDA.

AB Background: The nosologic relationship between dementia with Lewy
   bodies (DLB) and Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD) is continuously
   being debated. We conducted a study using voxel-based morphometry (VBM)
   to explore the pattern of cortical atrophy in DLB and PDD.
   Methods: Seventy-four patients and healthy elderly were imaged (healthy
   elderly n = 20, PDD n = 15, DLB n = 18, and Alzheimer dementia [AD] n =
   21). Three dimensional T1-weighted MRI were acquired, and images
   analyzed using VBM. The following diagnostic criteria were used:
   criteria proposed by the third report of the DLB Consortium for DLB,
   the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and
   Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Diseases Association
   criteria for AD, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders, fourth edition criteria for dementia in PDD.
   Results: Overall dementia severity was similar in the dementia groups.
   We found more pronounced cortical atrophy in DLB than in PDD in the
   temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Patients with AD had reduced
   gray matter concentrations in the temporal lobes bilaterally, including
   the amygdala, compared to PDD. Compared to DLB, the AD group had
   temporal and frontal lobe atrophy.
   Conclusion: We found that despite a similar severity of dementia,
   patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) had more cortical atrophy
   than patients with Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD), indicating
   different brain substrates underlying dementia in the two syndromes.
   Together with previous studies reporting subtle clinical and
   neurobiologic differences between DLB and PDD, our findings support the
   hypothesis that PDD and DLB are not identical entities, but rather
   represent two subtypes of a spectrum of Lewy body disease.

AB Color management is an efficient means of ensuring the quality of color
   reproduction and is regarded as being one of the major issues in the
   printing industry. It is a total technology that manages the color
   reproduction of input devices such as scanners and digital cameras and
   of output devices such as display monitors and printers. It also
   ensures that satisfactory controls are applied throughout the process
   as far as the final printing. In color management, the display monitors
   must be able to offer a display performance that confirms a stable and
   long term, quality color finish. For this purpose, an LCD panel with a
   wide field angle was developed that features a wider color reproduction
   gamut and more impressive luminance/chrominance stability than has been
   available with previous display monitors.

DE cooperative security; coordination of security management; InfoCage
   series; linkages with partner vendor products
AB Just as broadband networking, high-performance and light-weight laptops
   and useful applications have significantly improved enterprise IT
   environments, the targets and complexities of security management have
   also tended to increase significantly. Actions against security
   problems are now required to be performed in no delay. The resulting
   movement of information and its carrying devices have produced many
   security issues that cannot be dealt with by a single, static security
   countermesure. In order to deal effectively with this situation, this
   paper proposes the notion of "cooperative security." Cooperative
   security allows security countermeasure utilities with different target
   domains to be mutually linked, thus achieving double or triple security
   management of the information and its carrying devices as well as
   maintaining a high security level for the enterprise. The new InfoCage
   series is a suite of utilities for implementing such management
   policies. It is also planned that "cooperative security" will be
   extended to the partner vendor products in order to enhance security
   linkages to the applications of other business fields such as paper
   documents and floor entrance/exit management systems, etc.

AB Recently embedded software development has noticeably been increasing

   measurement/analysis tool called "mevalet," which is compatible with
   Linux running on ARM CPU, and features an added data save function
   using a miniSD card instead of a data transfer function that uses the
   network. This tool has improved the development efficiency

TI An objective method for bed capacity planning in a hospital department

AB Objectives: To propose an objective approach in order to determine the
   number of beds required for a hospital department by considering how
   recruitment fluctuates over time. To compare this approach with
   classical bed capacity planning techniques.
   Methods. A simulated data-based evaluation of the impact that the
   variability in hospital department activity produces upon the
   performance of methods used for determining the number of beds
   required. The evaluation criteria included productive efficiency
   measured by the bed occupancy rate, accessibility measured by the
   transfer rate of patients due to lack of available beds and a proxy of
   clinical effectiveness, by the proportion of days during which there is
   no possibility for unscheduled admission.
   Results: When the variability of the number of daily patients
   increases, the Target Occupancy Rate favors productive efficiency at
   the expense of accessibility and proxy clinical effectiveness. On the
   contrary, when the variability of the department activity is marginal,
   the Target Activity Rate penalizes the proxy of clinical effectiveness,
   and the Target Occupancy Rate under-optimizes productive efficiency.
   The method we propose led to a superior performance in terms of
   accessibility and proxy of clinical effectiveness at the expense of
   productive efficiency. Such a situation is suitable for intensive care
   units. In the case of other departments, a weighting procedure should
   be used to improve productive efficiency.
   Conclusions. This approach could be considered as the first step of a
   family of methods for quantitative healthcare planning.

AB There are few data published on lung cancer survival in the UK.
   Survival rates for lung cancer at a UK Hospital between 1998-2001 are
   described.
   Methods: Analysis of data collected from multidisciplinary team (MDT)
   meetings, lung cancer registrations and hospital coding.
   Results: 835 new lung cancers were diagnosed comprising 597 non-small
   cell lung cancers (NSCLC) (71%), 133 small cell (SCLC) (16%), and 105
   clinical diagnoses (13%). Stage at diagnosis; stage I (25%), II (9%),
   IIIA (8%), IIIB (23%), IV (35%). Surgery was undertaken in 12%, radical
   radiotherapy (RT) in 4%, palliative RT in 32%, chemotherapy in 8% and
   best supportive care (BSC) in 36%. The 3-year cumulative survival for
   NSCLC was: stage I 39%, stage II 30%, stage III 6%, stage IV 0.5%. Only
   46% of patients with stage I-IIIA disease received radical treatment.
   Reasons included poor lung function (32%), unresectable (24%),
   co-morbidities (17%), performance status (8%), patient choice (8%),
   unclear (6%), advanced age (5%).
   Conclusions: Survival figures are similar to other UK studies but do
   not compare favourably with US and European data. This may be because a
   large proportion of patients with early stage disease receive
   palliative care only. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

DT Article
DE personality and academic performance; 16 personality factor
   questionnaire; veterinary medical education
ID SCHOOL ADMISSION INTERVIEWS
AB To aid in selecting students for admission to undergraduate veterinary
   training, admissions procedures often take into account students'
   previous academic performance as well as the results of an interview.
   The study reported here investigated the relationship between
   personality and academic success. Students from three entry cohorts to
   the second year of study of a six-year BVSc program at the University
   of Pretoria completed the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire. A
   meta-analytic approach was used to estimate the relationship between
   academic performance in two major final-year subjects and academic
   performance on entry, an interview score, and the personality factors.
   The study confirmed the value of previous academic performance and the
   interview in selecting students for the veterinary degree program. The
   findings also indicate that the inclusion of a measure of intellectual
   ability could be of value. The value of various personality
   characteristics in predicting good study habits and examination
   performance is highlighted by the study results: students were more
   successful if they were conscientious, emotionally stable, socially
   adept, self-disciplined, practical rather than imaginative, and relaxed
   rather than anxious. It appears worthwhile to consider including an
   appropriate personality questionnaire in the selection process to
   improve the accuracy of predictions of students' success. A sound
   personality make-up will not only increase the likelihood of academic
   success but should also be beneficial in the successful management of a
   veterinary practice and in enjoying veterinary science as a career.

AB Low soil fertility is one of the greatest biophysical constraints to
   agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa. "Improved fallow," an
   agroforestry-based soil fertility replenishment technology was
   developed in response to the depletion of soil fertility and increasing
   difficulty of small-scale farmers to afford mineral fertilizers. The
   biophysical performance of the technology to improve soil fertility and
   increase crop yield has been well demonstrated and efforts are being
   made to enhance the adoption its adoption by farmers. There is
   relatively little information and systematic feedback regarding
   farmers' perception and knowledge of the technology. Using data
   collected from a stratified sample of 302 farmers in Zambia, this study
   analyzed farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of soil
   fertility and food Security problems, highlighting implications for
   user acceptability and the development of sustainable soil fertility
   management technologies. Results show that farmers have good
   understanding of soil fertility issues, its linkage to food security
   and household welfare indicators. They appreciate improved fallow
   because it responds to the critical problems of low soil fertility and
   provides additional benefits to the household. However, there are some
   challenges to the widespread uptake of the technology including land
   constraints, property rights availability of seeds, and
   knowledge-intensive nature of the technology. Farmer acceptability and
   improved adoption of the technology will be influenced by the extent to
   which efforts are taken to meet these challenaes. Farmers' response on
   knowledge, attitude, and perception provides valuable inputs for
   further development and modification of the technology. Beyond
   technology development, an understanding of farmers' preference and
   other contextual issues-within which the technology is expected to be
   adopted-will enable researchers to develop appropriate sustainable
   technologies and enhance user acceptability of the same. The study
   shows that technical characteristics are important but not exclusive
   conditions for farmers' acceptability and adoption of good agricultural
   technologies by farmers.

DE grain yield; green manure; green gram; N accumulation; N utilization;

ID NITROGEN; PERFORMANCE
AB Rice needs adequate nitrogen, particularly under rainfed lowland
   situation, to ensure its growth for optimum grain yield. Traditional
   practice of applying entire dose of N fertilizer during sowing causes
   its low recovery. Nonetheless, it does not sustain over subsequent
   growth of rice, mainly due to uncontrolled waterlogged situation. Green
   manuring along with chemical N application was reported as advantageous
   ensuring sustained availability of adequate N over the period. A field
   study on green manuring, rice under rainfed lowland situation was
   conducted during wet seasons in 2001 to 2004 in the Central Rice
   Research Institute, Cuttack, India. The photosensitive, tall and
   long-duration rice variety, Durga was grown along with green gram
   (Phaseolus radiatus) for green manuring under three mixed cropping
   stands, that is, additive system, replacement system, and
   broadcast-sown stands. Green gram, also known as mung bean, is a widely
   grown pulse crop. As a leguminous crop, it is capable of contributing
   considerable amount of green matter and N into the soil. Thus it can be
   used for green manuring to facilitate N nutrition to the rice grown in
   its association. Rice was sown at 15 x 20 cm spacing (plant x row),
   except in broadcast-sown stands where rice and green gram seeds were
   mixed thoroughly before sowing and broadcasted evenly without
   maintaining any plant/row arrangement. In the additive system, one row
   of green gram was intercropped after emery two consecutive rice rows,
   when Usual row spacing was changed therein. Thus the adjacent rice rows
   were 10 cm apart from green gram row. In the replacement system, one
   rice row after every two consecutive rice rows was replaced with one
   row of green gram without changing usual row spacing, that is, the
   adjacent rice rows were 20 cm apart from green gram row. These
   green-manured mixed stands were compared with two pure stands of rice,
   that is, rice grown with usual dose of 40 kg N/ha and rice grown
   without N. Similar management practices were followed for both the
   crops altogether and no additional fertilizers were applied in green
   gram. Growth dynamics of green gram as evidenced from its plant height
   and dry matter recorded at regular intervval showed no variation over
   the years. It was incorporated into the soil at its flowering stage
   accumlating 7.00 to 25.60 kg N/ha over the years under different
   stands. Rice growth due to green manuring in the replacement system
   remained consistently better than other stands in all the years. As a
   consequence, rice under the replacement system significantly
   out-yielded other stands producing 2.41 to 2.52 t/ha over the years,
   which was at par with that treated with fertilizer N alone (2.48 and
   2.60 t/ha), while grain yield (2.12 to 2.20 t/ha) under the additive
   system was significantly higher than broadcast-sown crop (1.77 and 1.84
   t/ha). In addition,N utilization pattern revealed that crops under the
   replacement system derived higher Agronomic efficiency (43.50 to 53.50
   kg grain/kg N applied), N uptake (27.75 to 29.30 kg/ha), and N recovery
   (56.25 to 66.00%, respectively) over the years as compared with that in
   other cropping geometry.

AB In 6 studies, the authors tested whether the effect of mood on
   self-control success depends on a person's accessible goal. We propose
   that positive mood signals a person to adopt an accessible goal,
   whereas negative mood signals a person to reject an accessible goal;
   therefore, if a self-improvement goal is accessible, happy (vs. neutral
   or unhappy) people perform better on self-control tasks that further
   that goal. Conversely, if a mood management goal is accessible, happy
   people abstain from self-control tasks because the tasks are
   incompatible with this goal. This pattern receives consistent support
   across several self-control tasks, including donating to charity,
   demonstrating physical endurance, seeking negative feedback, and
   completing tests.

   PROTEASE; ADAMTS-13; CHILDREN; PLASMA; DIAGNOSIS; TTP
AB Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening
   disorder characterised by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia,
   thrombocytopenia and signs of ischaemic organ dysfunction such as
   neurological or renal impairment and fever. The diagnosis of TTP should
   be considered in any child presenting with thrombocytopenia, in
   particular those children with microangiopathic haemolysis, atypical
   immune thrombocytopenia purpura or Evan's syndrome. Distinguishing TTP
   from haemolytic uraemic syndrome is difficult, but where there is doubt
   about the diagnosis, a presumptive diagnosis of TTP should be made to
   allow potentially life-saving therapy with therapeutic plasma exchange.
   Recent advances in the molecular basis of the disease have resulted in
   assays for ADAMTS-13 activity, inhibitor levels and ADAMTS-13 mutation
   analysis. These assays help to distinguish TTP from haemolytic uraemic
   syndrome. However, the performance characteristics of these assays in
   the diagnosis and management of TTP are yet to be defined.

TI Materials degradation in fission reactors: Lessons learned of relevance
   to fusion reactor systems
SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
LA English
DT Article
ID PROTONS; STEELS
AB The management of materials in power reactor systems has become a
   critically important activity in assuring the safe, reliable and
   economical operation of these facilities. Over the years, the
   commercial nuclear power reactor industry has faced numerous
   'surprises' and unexpected occurrences in materials. Mitigation
   strategies have sometimes solved one problem at the expense of creating
   another. Other problems have been solved successfully and have
   motivated the development of techniques to foresee problems before they
   occur. This paper focuses on three aspects of fission reactor
   experience that may benefit future fusion systems. The first is
   identification of parameters and processes that have had a large impact
   on the behavior of materials in fission systems such as temperature,
   dose rate, surface condition, gradients, metallurgical variability and
   effects of the environment. The second is the development of materials
   performance and failure models to provide a basis for assuring
   component integrity. Last is the development of proactive materials
   management programs that identify and pre-empt degradation processes
   before they can become problems. These aspects of LWR experience along
   with the growing experience with materials in the more demanding
   advanced fission reactor systems form the basis for a set of 'lessons
   learned' to aid in the successful management of materials in fusion
   reactor systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WHITE-COLLAR CRIME; CEO STOCK-OPTIONS; ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE;
   EARNINGS MANAGEMENT; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; CORPORATE-STRATEGY; FIRM
   PERFORMANCE; AGENCY THEORY; RISK-TAKING; BOARD
AB The accounting scandals of recent years have raised concerns about the
   efficacy of incentive alignment and control systems. Among matched
   firms that either did or did not restate misleading financial
   disclosures during the period 1994-2003, both managerial equity
   ownership and contingent compensation were positively related to
   restatements when considered independently of other factors such as
   firm performance and board characteristics. When these variables were
   introduced, performance positively moderated the relationship between
   ownership and restatements, although contingent compensation was no
   longer significant. Finally, misleading disclosures were less prevalent
   in firms whose boards had high levels of business experience and long
   tenure.

AB The authors adopt and develop an institutional perspective to advance
   understanding of how host country environments influence subsidiary
   staffing strategies. They propose and find that (a)firms rely more on
   expatriates in institutionally distant environments for reasons related
   to the efficient transfer of management practices and find-specific
   capabilities and (b) the positive influence of expatriate staffing
   levels on subsidiary performance is dependent on the institutional
   distance between the host and home country, and subsidiary experience.
   The authors' findings are based on their analysis of expatriate
   employment levels and performance in 12,997 foreign subsidiaries of
   2,952 Japanese firms in 48 countries.

AB The literature on organizations and the natural environment, published
   since 1992, is reviewed, with the purpose of determining if and what
   the contributions have been to strategy and organizational theory. The
   author performs the review at three levels-firm, industry, and
   organizational environment. Subsequently, he discusses empirical and
   conceptual constraints on the production of quality research and
   highlights research that successfully overcomes these barriers.

AB A promising biological, sustainable, non-hazardous, safe and
   environmental friendly management and disposal technique of domestic
   wastewater sludge is global expectation. Fungal entrapped biosolids as
   a result of prior fungal treated raw wastewater sludge was recycled to
   evaluate its performance as inoculum for bioseparation/bioconversion of
   supplemented sludge in view of continuous as well as scale up
   wastewater sludge treatment. Encouraging results were achieved in
   bioseparation of suspended solids and in dewaterability/filterability
   of treated domestic wastewater sludge. Fungal entrapped biosolids
   offered 98% removal of total suspended solids (TSS) in supplemented
   sludge treatment at 6-day without nutrient (wheat flour, WF) supply.
   Consequently, 99% removal of turbidity and 87% removal of chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) were achieved in supernatant of treated sludge. The
   lowest value (1.75 x 10(12) m/kg) of specific resistance to filtration
   (SRF) was observed at 6-day after treatment, which was equivalent to
   the 70% decrease of SIZE The all results except SRF were not influenced
   further in treatments accompanied with WF supplementation. The present
   treatments offered significant (P <= 0.01) improvement in all results
   except SRF of treated wastewater sludge compared to the control.
   Furthermore, the present result is addressing a potential avenue of
   probable solution for expected management and disposal of domestic
   wastewater sludge in future. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The UK has a universal health care system that is free at
   the point of access. Over the past decade, the UK government has
   implemented an ambitious agenda of quality improvement initiatives in
   chronic disease management.
   Objective: To assess the quality of diabetes care and intermediate
   clinical outcomes within a multiethnic population after a sustained
   period of investment in quality improvement.
   Design: Population based cross-sectional survey, using electronic
   general practice records, carried out between November 2005 and January
   2006.
   Patinents: Seven thousand six hundred five adults (>= 18 years) with
   diabetes registered with 32 primary care practices.
   Measurements: Percentage achievement by ethnic group (black, south
   Asian, or white) of the quality indicators for diabetes in a new
   pay-for performance contract.
   Results: There were only modest variations in recording of process
   measures of care between ethnic groups, with no significant differences
   in recent measurement of blood pressure, HbA1c, cholesterol,
   micro-albuminuria, creatinine, or retinopathy screening attendance.
   Blacks and south Asians were significantly less likely to meet all
   three national treatment targets for diabetes (HbA1c <= 7.4%, blood
   pressure <= 145/85 mmHg, total cholesterol <= 5 mmol/L [193 mg/dL])
   than whites (25.3%, 24.8% , and 32.0%, respectively).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that substantial investment in
   quality improvement initiatives in the UK may have led to more
   systematic and equitable processes of care for diabetes but have not
   addressed ethnic disparities in intermediate clinical outcomes.

AB Quality control plays a critical role in the process of translating the
   traditional/alternative medicines into modern evidence-based therapies.
   High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is widely applied to
   assess the chemical composition of botanical drug products. The
   chromatographic fingerprints or chemical profiles are currently used as
   the de jacto quality control metric. As a complement to chemical
   profiles, a biological quality control assessment offers distinct
   advantages. This study describes a genome-wide biological response
   fingerprinting (BioReF) approach to define a set of marker genes that
   define a signature pattern for a specific botanical formulation. These
   marker genes are chosen on the basis of the levels of the regulated
   expression and the involvement in the cellular signaling pathways.
   Subsequently, qRT-PCR technique is used to simultaneously monitor the
   gene expression of multiple marker genes in an efficient and
   quantitative manner. This set of marker genes represents the biological
   responses of human cells to the chemical composition of the botanical
   drug that could serve as potential quality control of botanical drugs
   in terms of the consistency of biological activities. We demonstrate
   the BioReF approach with a well-documented Chinese Medicine formula,
   designated as ISF-1, traditionally used for the management of
   post-stroke disorders. A set of nine marker genes were selected to
   assess the batch-to-batch consistency of the biological effects of
   ISF-1. This approach provides a potential comprehensive and
   cost-effective quality control metric of the biological activities of
   botanical drugs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FORT HOOD; VEGETATION
AB Off-road vehicles increase soil erosion by reducing vegetation cover
   and other types of ground cover, and by changing the structure of soil.
   The investigation of the relationship between disturbance from off-road
   vehicles and the intensity of the activities that involve use of
   vehicles is essential for water and soil conservation and facility
   management. Models have been developed in a previous study to predict
   disturbance caused by off-road vehicles. However, the effect of data on
   model quality and model performance, and the appropriate structure of
   models have not been previously investigated. In order to improve the
   quality and performance of disturbance models, this study was designed
   to investigate the effects of model structure and data. The experiment
   considered and tested: (1) two measures of disturbance based on the
   Vegetation Cover Factor (C Factor) of the Revised Universal Soil Loss
   Equation (RUSLE) and Disturbance Intensity; (2) model structure using
   two modeling approaches; and (3) three subsets of data. The adjusted
   R-square and residuals from validation data are used to represent model
   quality and performance, respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is
   used to identify factors which have significant effects on model
   quality and performance. The results of the ANOVA show that subsets of
   data have significant effects on both model quality and performance for
   both measures of disturbance. The ANOVA also detected that the C Factor
   models have higher quality and performance than the Disturbance models.
   Although modeling approaches are not a significant factor based on the
   ANOVA tests, models containing interaction terms can increase the
   adjusted R-squares for nearly all tested conditions and the maximum
   improvement can reach 31%). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims to explore the green supply chain management (GSCM)
   initiatives (implementation) of various manufacturing industrial
   sectors in China and examine the links between GSCM initiatives and
   performance outcomes. We conducted a survey to collect data from four
   typical manufacturing industrial sectors in China, namely, power
   generating, chemical/petroleum, electrical/electronic and automobile,
   and received 171 valid organizational responses for data analysis.
   Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data. The results
   are consistent with our prediction that the different manufacturing
   industry types display different levels of GSCM implementation and
   outcorries. We specifically found that the electrical/electronic
   industry has relatively higher levels of GSCM implementation and
   achieves better performance outcomes than the other three manufacturer
   types. Implications of the results are discussed and suggestions for
   further research on the implementation of GSCM are offered. (c) 2006

AB Water temperature is an important physical variable in aquatic
   ecosystems. It can affect both chemical and biological processes such
   as dissolved oxygen concentration and both the metabolism and growth of
   aquatic organisms. For water resource management, stream water
   temperature models that can accurately reproduce the essential
   statistical characteristics of historical data can be very useful. The
   present study deals with the modeling in the Deschutes River of average
   weekly maximum temperature (AWMT) series using univariate stochastic
   approaches. Autoregressive (AR) and periodic autoregressive (PAR)
   models were used to model AWMT data. The AR model consisted of
   decomposing water temperature data into a long-term annual component
   and a residual component. The long-term annual component was modeled by
   fitting a sine function to the time series, while the residuals
   representing the departure from the long-term annual component were
   modeled using a Markov chain process. The PAR model was applied to the
   standardized data obtained by subtracting the AWMT series from
   interannual mean of each period. To test the performance of the above
   models, the leave-one-out (Jackknife) technique was used. The results
   indicated that both models have good predictive ability for a
   relatively large system such as the Dechutes River. On an annual basis
   from 1963 to 1980, the average root mean square error varied between
   0.81 and 0.90 degrees C for AR(1) and PAR(1), respectively, and the
   mean bias remained near 0 degrees C. Averaged Nash-Sutcliffe
   coefficient of efficiency (NSC) values obtained by AR (0.94) and PAR
   (0.92) models were close and comparable. Of the two models, the PAR(1)
   model seemed the most promising based on its performance and ability to
   model periodicity in autocorrelations. Since no exogenous variables
   such as air temperatures and streamflow were incorporated, the use of
   the PAR model limits the managerial decisions in natural streams and
   rivers.

   balancing somatic fitness with genetic sterility. Doses of 40, 60, and
   80 Gy induced 95% or more sterility in all males, which in turn induced
   similar degrees of sterility into a cohort of wild flies in the
   laboratory. However, a low dose of 40 Cy was sufficient to completely
   suppress egg production in females. Similarly, a mild carryover of
   genetic damage might have been transferred to the F1 progeny of males
   irradiated at 40 Gy crossed with fertile wild females. Our results
   suggest that the 80-Gy dose currently applied in Mexico can be lowered
   substantially without jeopardizing program goals. This view could be
   strengthened by comparing performance of males irradiated at different
   doses under more natural settings, In general, we discuss the value of
   determining irradiation doses for pest species where females are more
   radiosensitive than males, by selecting the dose that causes 100%
   sterility in females.

AB 1. A recent experiment varied the genetic diversity of model grassland
   communities under standardized soil and management conditions and at
   constant initial species diversity. After 5 years' growth, genetically
   diverse communities retained more species diversity and became more
   similar in species composition than genetically impoverished
   communities.
   2. Here we present the results of further investigation within this
   experimental system. We proposed that two mechanisms - the first
   invoking genetically determined and constant differences in plant
   phenotypes and the second invoking genotype-environment interactions -
   could each underpin these results. This mechanistic framework was used
   as a tool to interpret our findings.
   3. We used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) DNA markers to confirm
   which of the individuals of six study species initially included in the
   model communities were unique genotypes. We then used the molecular
   markers to assess the survival and abundance of each genotype at the
   end of the 5-year experimental period.
   4. The DNA marker data were used to create, for the first time, a
   genotype abundance hierarchy describing the structure of a community at
   the level of genotypes. This abundance hierarchy revealed wide
   variation in the abundance of genotypes within species, and large
   overlaps in the performance of the genotypes of different species.
   5. Each genotype achieved a consistent level of abundance within
   genetically diverse communities, which differed from that attained by
   other genotypes of the same species. The abundance hierarchy of
   genotypes within species also showed consistency across communities
   differing in their initial level of genetic diversity, such that
   species abundance in genetically impoverished communities could be
   predicted, in part, by genotypic identity.
   6. Three species (including two canopy-dominants) experienced shifts in
   their community-level genotype abundance hierarchies that were
   consistent with an increased influence of genotype-environment
   interactions in genetically impoverished communities.
   7. Our results indicate that under relatively constant environmental
   conditions the species abundance structure of plant communities can in
   part be predicted from the genotypic composition of their component
   populations. Genotype-environment interactions also appear to shape the
   structure of communities under such conditions, although further
   experiments are needed to clarify the magnitude and mechanism of these
   effects.

AB An important problem facing managers is how to enhance the credibility,
   or believability, of their earnings forecasts. In this paper, we
   experimentally test whether a characteristic of a management earnings
   fore cast-namely, whether it is disaggregated-can affect its
   credibility. We also test whether disaggregation moderates the relation
   between managerial incentives and forecast credibility Disaggregated
   forecasts include an earnings forecast as well as forecasts of other
   key line items comprising that earnings forecast. Our results indicate
   that disaggregated forecasts are judged to be more credible than
   aggregated ones and that disaggregation works to counteract the effect
   of high incentives. We also develop and test an original model that
   explains how disaggregation positively impacts three factors that, in
   turn, influence forecast credibility: perceived precision of
   management's beliefs, perceived clarity of the forecast, and perceived
   financial reporting quality. We show that forecast disaggregation works
   to remedy incentive problems only via its effect on perceived financial
   reporting quality. Overall, our study adds to our understanding of how
   managers can credibly communicate their expectations about the future
   to market participants.

AB Full field lithography performance of production extreme ultraviolet
   lithography (EUVL) toot has been studied when thermal deformation of
   mask and projection optics (PO) can not be neglected at 45 nm node. The
   thermal deformation of a philosophic design of EUV mask with certain
   local pattern density had been analyzed. The results show that thermal
   management is needed. The lithography performance of deformed EUVL
   system is degraded significantly due to the maximum pattern placement
   error of 5.9 nm on the wafer, consequently result in poor overlay
   accuracy. The results indicate that thermal deformation of system
   result in a tight role of system design, mask and resist technology.

AB Background: Complementary and alternative therapies may be adopted as
   nursing interventions to alleviate dysmenorrhea and improve
   productivity, creativity, work performance, and quality of life.
   Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of San Yin Jiao
   (SP6) acupressure as a non-pharmaco logic nursing intervention for
   dysmenorrhea and identify its effects on temperature changes in two
   related acupoints as an explanatory mechanism of Z circulation.
   Design: A non-equivalent control group pre and post-test design was
   employed to verify the effects of SP6 acupressure on skin temperature
   and dysmenorrhea. Setting and participants: Young college women with
   primary dysmenorrhea were recruited from classrooms at two universities
   in Korea and 58 eligible participants were allotted to either a SP6
   acupressure group or placebo group that received light touch on the SP6
   acupoint.
   Methods: The experimental group received acupressure treatment within
   the first 8 It of menstruation, and severity of dysmenorrhea and skin
   temperature changes in the Zhongwan (CV2) and Qugu (CV12) acupoints
   were assessed prior to and 30 min, 1, 2, and 3 It following treatment.
   Results: There was a significant difference in severity of dysmenorrhea
   between the two groups immediately after (F = 18.50, p = 0.000) and for
   up to 2 It (F = 8.04, p = 0.032) post treatment. Skin temperature was
   significantly elevated at 30 min after acupressure at the suprapubic
   CV2 acupoint in the experimental group compared to the control group.
   Temperature elevation was also noted at the epigastric CV12 acupoint
   post treatment but group differences were not significant, indicating
   that SP6 acupressure relieves dysmenorrhea primarily by temperature
   elevation in the CV2 pathway.
   Conclusions: Acupressure to the SP6 meridian can be an effective
   non-invasive nursing intervention for alleviation of primary
   dysmenorrhea, with effects lasting 2 h post treatment. (C) 2006

AB Over the past two decades, industrial relations (IR) have seen the
   continuous decline of trade unions and a growing interest in high
   performance work practices (HPWPs). Human resource researchers,
   examining the traditional adversarial IR strategies, are increasingly
   calling for more co-operative and innovative HPWPs in employment
   relations. Can traditional union adversarial strategies exist along
   with HPWPs or does one necessarily exclude the other? To answer this
   question, this study, using questionnaires collected from locally owned
   and multinational corporations in Taiwan, investigates the association
   between unionization rate and HPWPs. Contrary to most findings from the
   Western context, HPWPs were found to have a positive and statistically
   significant impact on unionization at the firm level in Taiwan. The
   positive impact may be result of close and friendly relationship
   between employers and unions and the practices of 'employer-sponsored'
   unions in Taiwan. Furthermore, traditional Confucian culture and
   institutional factors have strengthened the influence of HPWPs on
   unionization.

AB Piezoelectric fans have emerged as a viable cooling technology for the
   thermal management of electronic devices, owing to their lowpower
   consumption, minimal noise emission, and small and configurable
   dimensions. Piezoelectric fans are investigated for application in the
   cooling of low-power electronics. Different experimental configurations
   are considered, and the effect of varying the fan amplitude, the
   distance between the fan and the heat source, the fan length, its
   frequency offset from resonance, and the fan offset from the center of
   the heat source are studied to assess the cooling potential of the
   fans. A design of experiments (DOE) analysis revealed the fan frequency
   offset from resonance and the fan amplitude as the critical parameters.
   Transfer functions are obtained from the DOE analysis for the
   implementation of these fans in electronics cooling. For the best case,
   an enhancement in convective heat transfer coefficient exceeding 375%
   relative to natural convection was observed, resulting in a temperature
   drop at the heat source of more than 36.4 degrees C. A computational
   model for the flow field and heat transfer induced by the piezoelectric
   fan is also developed. Effects of the flow on convection heat transfer
   for different fan-to-heat source distances and boundary conditions are
   analyzed. Transition between distinct convection patterns is observed
   with changes in the parameters. The computational results are validated
   against experimental measurements, with good agreement. (c) 2006

AB Objective: To compare reproductive outcome in women with uterine
   anomalies and women with a normat uterus, and evatuate the effect of
   resectoscope metroptasty. Methods: The pregnancy outcomes, past and
   present, of 105 women with congenital uterine anomalies were compared
   with those of 182 women with a normally shaped uterus. The outcomes of
   25 women with septate and bicornuate uteri before and after
   resectoscope metroplasty were also analyzed. 2 The x(2) and
   Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis, with P<0.05
   considered statistically significant. Results: Uterine anomalies were
   associated with higher rates of spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery,
   intrauterine growth retardation, breech presentation, and cesarean
   delivery (P<0.001). The highest incidence of early spontaneous abortion
   was noted among women with septate uteri, and the highest incidence of
   preterm labor was noted among women with arcuate or bicornuate uteri.
   Among women with arcuate uteri, significantly lower gestational age and
   birth-weight were observed compared with any other type of adverse
   outcome. Compared with their previous pregnancies, the abortion rates
   were tower and delivery rates were higher in women who conceived
   following hysteroscopic metroptasty (P<0.001). Conclusion:
   Resesctoscope metroptasty significantly improved pregnancy outcome in
   women with uterine anomalies. (c) 2007 International Federation of

AB Purpose - Research on strategic decision making has over-emphasized the
   importance of cognitive conflict because of its potential benefits.
   Recent research documented that, apart from the benefits, cognitive
   conflict leads to affective conflict. Taking information processing
   perspective, the present study seeks to argue that the benefits of
   cognitive conflict can be stimulated by the cognition-based trust,
   while the interplay between cognitive conflict and affective conflict
   can be influenced by affect-based trust. The present study therefore
   aims to demonstrate the divergent roles of the perceived
   trustworthiness as potential moderators in strategic decision-making
   teams.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using structured survey instrument,
   multi-informant data was collected from CEOs and senior executives of
   109 US hospitals. After performing confirmatory factor analysis of the
   measures used, the data was analyzed using hierarchical regression
   techniques to analyze divergent roles of cognition- and affect-based
   trust as moderators in the relationship between conflict and decision
   outcomes.
   Findings - Results showed that cognition-based trust is the key to
   fortify the benefits of cognitive conflict while affect-based trust is
   the panacea for the ills of cognitive conflict.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample consisted of hospitals
   in healthcare industry only. Self-report measures may have some
   inherent social desirability bias.
   Practical implications - This study contributes to both practicing
   managers as well as to strategic management literature. This study
   suggests that trust between the executives involved in strategic
   decision-making process plays an important role in enhancing decision
   quality. It is therefore suggested that CEOs and administrators engage
   the executives who have both cognition- and affect-based trust with
   each other to have successful decision outcomes.
   Originality/value - Though the sample in the present study focuses only
   on healthcare industry, to the extent strategic decision-making process
   is similar in other industries, the findings can be generalizable
   across other industries.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship
   between demographic characteristics, job stress, and cognitive and
   affective conflict faced by Chinese top managers and how this conflict
   is resolved over multiple rounds of conflict situations.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was designed and
   submitted to Chinese top managers of firms located in Sichuan Province,
   PRC. Besides Likert-type questions concerning demographic
   characteristics, job stress, and both types of conflict, contextual
   anchorage method was used to let top managers rank the conflict
   resolution styles they would prefer for solving a given situation of
   conflict.
   Findings - Data were submitted to hierarchical regression analysis. It
   was found that age is in negative relation with job stress and that the
   higher the education level of top managers, the more cognitive conflict
   they will experience. In turn, the more cognitive conflict, the more
   affective conflict will be experienced. In addition, it was found that
   job stress is in positive association with cognitive conflict. Finally
   and most importantly, the findings indicated that Chinese top managers
   are inclined to using integrating to handle conflict. This seems to be
   generally inconsistent with traditional Chinese culture.
   Originality/value - The paper accounted for respective calls that
   proposed to focus on the antecedent conditions of cognitive and
   affective conflict. Therefore, a framework containing important
   antecedent factors of conflict was proposed. As a first attempt, it
   integrated the relationship between job stress and conflict. Most
   importantly, and also as a first attempt, however, this study sought to
   identify the conflict resolution styles Chinese top managers applied
   over multiple rounds of conflict situations, whereas findings
   additionally differentiate between affective and cognitive types of
   conflict.

LA English
DT Article

ID RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; WORLD-CLASS; MASS CUSTOMIZATION; AGILE;

AB For many years, there has been a debate among researchers and
   practitioners about the notion of trade-o. s and their role in
   manufacturing strategy. This paper examines the practical issues
   surrounding trade-offers and manufacturing strategy, and offers a
   framework for better management of trade-offers. The analysis indicates
   that current views on trade-offers are either impractical or static.
   The authors propose a consolidated approach in which the focus of
   strategic improvement process is divided into short-term and long-term
   strategies. It is suggested that in the short term, strategic
   initiatives must focus on overcoming ' perceived' trade-offers and
   system constraints in order to achieve the firm's Manufacturing
   Performance Potential. In the long term, they must focus on eliminating
   the 'real' trade-offers and technical constraints of the system in
   order to achieve world-class levels of performance. While the current
   approaches to trade-offer improvement focus on compromises and/ or
   application of current 'best practices', manufacturing system and
   process innovation are proposed as the key to the elimination of
   trade-offers. Two problem-solving methodologies, Theory of Constraints
   and Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, were found to provide useful
   tools necessary for system and process innovation. With the aid of a
   case study, we demonstrate how these methodologies can be used to
   eliminate manufacturing trade-offers, in order to improve a company's
   competitiveness.

ID SIMULATION; SYSTEM; ARCHITECTURE; ALGORITHMS
AB In a job shop such as a mould-making shop, dispatching decisions as to
   which job should be loaded on a machine when it becomes free are termed
   dynamic scheduling. A practical approach to dynamic job-shop scheduling
   is the use of discrete event simulation, and their dedicated
   simulation-based dynamic scheduling systems, often known as
   manufacturing execution systems or advanced planning systems, are
   available. In the present paper, we propose a workflow-based dynamic
   scheduling framework, in which a workflow management system (WfMS)
   serves as a dynamic job-shop scheduler. For this purpose, we have
   developed an algorithm for embedding a discrete-event simulation
   mechanism into a WfMS, and have implemented a prototype job-shop
   scheduler. Illustrative performance evaluation shows that the proposed
   framework is logically valid and computationally efficient.

ID ADAPTIVE SEARCH; ALGORITHM
AB In this paper, resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP)
   is discussed with an objective of minimizing the makespan of a project.
   Due to its universality, it has a variety of applications as in
   manufacturing, production planning, project management and elsewhere.
   It is a well known computationally complex problem, thus warrants the
   application of heuristics techniques or AI based optimization tools to
   achieve optimal or near optimal solution in real time. In this
   research, the artificial immune system (AIS) approach is proposed to
   solve the aforementioned problem. It exploits the beauty of learning
   and memory acquisition to ensure the convergence with faster rate.
   During extensive computational experiment, it is found that the
   performance of the AIS algorithm on a well known data set of
   resource-constrained project scheduling problem is superior as compared
   to GA, fuzzy-GA, LFT, GRU, SIO, MINSLK, RSM, RAN, and MJP based
   approaches.

AB The objective of this article is to identify the relationship between

   making and organization performance. A field work was developed on 93
   small and medium-size enterprises. The collected data was analyzed by
   econometrical and statistical techniques, and then the results,
   implications and boundaries are discussed. The results show that there
   are a positive and significance relationship between the quality design
   of strategic decision and organizational performance. Thus, the
   comprehensiveness and politicization are relevant for to explain the
   quality design of strategic decision. Moreover, the comprehensiveness
   and politicization was explained by flexibility of the decision process
   and the values congruence of the top management team. The
   transformational leadership is the principal determinant of the
   flexibility and values congruence. Therefore, is possible to identify a
   relationship between transformational leadership and organizational
   performance. Nevertheless, the transactional leadership has not
   statistical relevance on strategic decision making

ID INTRAABDOMINAL PRESSURE; AGREEMENT; TIME
AB Objective: Intra-abdominal hypertension is an independent cause of
   multiorgan failure and directly effects other physiological
   measurements, making it an important factor in the management of
   critically ill patients, but no clinical studies have investigated the
   reproducibility of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurement to ensure
   diagnostic accuracy. This study evaluated the intraobserver and
   interobserver variability of bladder pressure measurements.
   Design and setting: Prospective, observational study in a
   university-based adult surgical intensive care unit.
   Patients: Critically ill patients undergoing intra-abdominal pressure
   readings, measured by nursing staff.
   Measurements and results: The study compared patient IAP measurements
   obtained by the same nurse (intraobserver variation) and between two
   different nurses (interobserver variation) in critical care patients
   with clinical indications for IAP monitoring. Data related to the
   nursing technique and performance were observed and collected for each
   IAP measurement obtained. Good correlation of bladder pressure
   measurements between the same and different individuals was found.
   Intraobserver and interobserver Pearson's correlations for measured IAP
   were 0.934 and 0.950, respectively. A unit protocol for IAP measurement
   standardization was modified based on observational data collected.
   Conclusions: Intra-abdominal pressure can be accurately and reliably
   measured in critically ill patients by utilizing a standardized
   measurement device combined with a standardized clinical protocol.

AB A survey was conducted to study the performance and husbandry practices
   of Pugal sheep in its home tract. Data were recorded on management
   practices, body measurements, body weights, wool production and
   reproduction. Results indicated that animals were maintained under
   extensive management with at least 10 h grazing daily. Breeding rams
   were selected without giving due consideration to breed; and breeding
   and lambing took place throughout the year. Three-times shearing in a
   year, vaccination and routine treatment were also practised. The
   overall least squares means of body measurements of adults, viz. body
   length, height, chest girth, ear length and tail length were 61.59 +/-
   0.31, 61.76 +/- 0.17, 71.83 +/- 0.20, 9.48 +/- 0.11 and 17.70 +/- 0.22
   cm, respectively. Body weights at birth, 3, 6, 12 months and adult
   weights were 2.62 +/- 0.01, 17.70 +/- 0.05, 23.67 +/- 0.09, 29.62 +/-
   0.26 and 39.04 +/- 0.26 kg, respectively. Least squares means for
   greasy fleece weights in first, second, third and total annual clips
   were 558, 513, 549 and 1618 g, respectively. Body weights and greasy
   fleece weights differed significantly (P < 0.01) in the two sexes,
   males gained higher weights at all stages and produced heavier fleece
   in all the clips. The body weights of this breed were found quite
   comparable with Magra breed, which had the same breeding tract. Wool
   quality parameters indicated the suitability of wool for medium quality
   carpet manufacture. Age at first oestrus, age at first lambing, lambing
   percentage and lambing interval were 10.15 +/- 0.05 months, 15.47
   +/-.07 months, 98.12 +/- 4.25% and 283.13 +/- 0.95 days, respectively.

AB In this paper we propose a cross-layer retransmission control for TCP
   communication over a wireless link. With our proposed control, a
   retransmission delay for lost packet is reduced, packet losses in the
   wireless link are eliminated and all packets are delivered in the
   correct order. No change is required to TCP itself or to the sender.
   Our proposed method is implemented in a queue between the media access
   control (MAC) layer and logical link layer in a base station, and is
   designed to assist local retransmission control in the MAC layer.
   Computer simulations show that our proposed method can maximally use
   the bandwidth of the wireless link under high bit error rates
   conditions with conventional TCP control. The fairness problem of TCP
   communication between connections with different bit error rates in a
   wireless link is also improved, and MAC level fairness is also
   controllable.

   other actors emerging in the liberalized electric power supply

   adopted through cost-effective performance from the standpoint of
   investment protection. The performance improvements and observations
   are shown with processing time measurements according to the
   peculiarity of the power system analysis software packages embedded in
   the client-server-based energy management system (EMS). To cope with
   malicious intrusions into the cyber space through data links with
   outside information systems, an information exchange method using tough

   architecture is proposed for the realization of location awareness in
   cognitive radios and networks. The proposed architecture consists of
   location estimation and/or sensing, seamless positioning and inte rope
   rability, statistical learning and tracking, security and privacy,
   mobility management, and location-based applications. However, the
   focus of this article is on location-based applications where we
   demonstrate the utilization of location information in cognitive
   wireless networks by presenting some representative location-assisted
   network optimization applications such as location-assisted spectrum
   management, network planning and expansion, and handover. Our study
   unveils that location information can be used in cognitive wireless
   networks to optimize network performance. Possible solutions to the
   implementation issues are proposed, and the remaining open issues are
   also addressed.

AB In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of utilizing a large
   network of sensors in order to track multiple targets. Large-scale
   sensor array management has applications in a number of target tracking
   domains. For example, in ground target tracking, hundreds or even
   thousands of unattended ground sensors may be dropped over a large
   surveillance area. At any one time, it may then only be possible to
   utilize a very small number of the available sensors at the fusion
   center because of physical limitations, such as available
   communications bandwidth. A similar situation may arise in tracking
   sea-surface or underwater targets using a large network of sonobuoys.
   The general problem is then to select a small subset of the available
   sensors in order to optimize tracking performance. In a practical
   scenario with hundreds of sensors, the number of possible sensor
   combinations would make it infeasible to use enumeration in order to
   find the optimal solution. Motivated by this consideration, in this
   paper we use an efficient search technique in order, to determine
   near-optimal sensor utilization strategies in real-time. This search
   technique consists of convex optimization followed by greedy local
   search. We consider several problem formulations and the posterior
   Cramer-Rao lower bound is used as the basis for network management.
   Simulation results illustrate the performance of the algorithms, both
   in terms of their real-time capability and the resulting estimation
   accuracy. Furthermore, in comparisons it can also be seen that the
   proposed solutions are near-optimal.

AB Structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) techniques provide an
   effective means for dynamically concentrating computational effort and
   resources to appropriate regions in the application domain. However,
   due to their dynamism and space-time heterogeneity, scalable parallel
   implementation of SAMR applications remains a challenge. This paper
   investigates hybrid runtime management strategies and presents an
   adaptive hierarchical multipartitioner (AHMP) framework. AHMP
   dynamically applies multiple partitioners to different regions of the
   domain, in a hierarchical manner, to match the local requirements of
   the regions. Key components of the AHMP framework include a
   segmentation-based clustering algorithm (SBC) that can efficiently
   identify regions in the domain with relatively homogeneous partitioning
   requirements, mechanisms for characterizing the partitioning
   requirements of these regions, and a runtime system for selecting,
   configuring, and applying the most appropriate partitioner to each
   region. Further, to address dynamic resource situations for
   long-running applications, AHMP provides a hybrid partitioning strategy
   (HPS) that involves application-level pipelining, trading space for
   time when resources are sufficiently large and underutilized, and an
   application-level out-of-core strategy (ALOC), trading time for space
   when resources are scarce in order to enhance the survivability of
   applications. The AHMP framework has been implemented and
   experimentally evaluated on up to 1,280 processors of the IBM SP4
   cluster at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

TI Compiler-directed energy optimization for parallel-disk-based systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE disk subsystem; I/O traces; optimizing compilers; power-aware
   computing; parallel I/O
AB Disk subsystem is known to be a major contributor to overall power
   consumption of high-end parallel systems. Past research proposed
   several architectural-level techniques to reduce disk power by taking
   advantage of idle periods experienced by disks. Although such
   techniques have been known to be effective in certain cases, they share
   a common drawback: They operate in a reactive manner, i.e., they
   control disk power by observing past disk activity (for example, idle
   and active periods) and estimating future ones. Consequently, they can
   miss opportunities for saving power and incur significant performance
   penalties due to inaccuracies in predicting idle and active times.
   Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes and evaluates a
   compiler-driven approach to reducing disk power consumption of
   array-based scientific applications executing on parallel
   architectures. The proposed approach exposes disk layout information to
   the compiler, allowing it to derive the disk access pattern, i.e., the
   order in which parallel disks are accessed. This paper demonstrates two
   uses of this information. First, we can implement proactive disk power
   management, i.e., we can select the most appropriate power-saving
   strategy and disk-preactivation strategy based on the
   compiler-predicted future idle and active periods of parallel disks.
   Second, we can restructure the application code to increase the length
   of idle disk periods, which leads to better exploitation of available
   power-saving capabilities. We implemented both these approaches within
   an optimizing compiler and tested their effectiveness using a set of
   benchmark codes from the Spec 2000 suite and a disk power simulator.
   Our results show that the compiler-driven disk power management is very
   promising. The experimental results also reveal that, although
   proactive disk power management is very effective, code restructuring
   for disk power achieves additional energy savings across all the
   benchmarks tested, and these savings are very close to optimal savings
   that can be obtained through an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based
   scheme.

AB This paper presents a bandwidth management framework for the support of
   Differentiated-Service-aware Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) in
   multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) networks. Our bandwidth management
   framework contains both bandwidth allocation and preemption mechanisms
   in which the link bandwidth is managed in two dimensions: class type
   (CT) and preemption priority. We put forward a Max-Min bandwidth
   constraint model in which we propose a novel "use it or lend it"
   strategy. The new model is able to guarantee a minimum bandwidth for
   each CT without causing resource fragmentation. Furthermore, we design
   three new bandwidth preemption algorithms for three bandwidth
   constraint models, respectively. An extensive simulation study is
   carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the bandwidth constraint
   models and preemption algorithms. When compared with the existing
   constraint models and preemption rules, the proposed Max-Min constraint
   model and preemption algorithms improve not only bandwidth efficiency,
   but also robustness and fairness. They achieve significant performance
   improvement for the well-behaving traffic classes in terms of bandwidth
   utilization and bandwidth blocking and preemption probability. We also
   provide guidelines for selecting different DS-TE bandwidth management
   mechanisms.

ID SUPERLATTICE; MICROREFRIGERATORS
AB Cooling hot-spots with high heat flux (e.g., > 1000 W/cm(2)) is
   becoming one of the most important technical challenge in today's
   integrated circuit industry. More aggressive thermal solutions, than
   would be required for uniform heating, are highly desired. Recently,
   solid state thermoelectric coolers (TECs) have received more attention
   for hot-spot thermal management. However, present day TECs typically
   have cooling flux much lower than heat flux in the hot-spots. In this
   work, we reported an innovative technique-TE Mini-contact-to
   significantly increase cooling flux of TECs for the application in
   hot-spot cooling. A chip package featuring a TE Mini-contact cooler
   integrated with conventional integrated heat spreader and heat sink is
   designed. The cooling performance of such chip package has been
   investigated by using a 3-D numeric model. It is found that the cooling
   in the hot-spot (1250 W/cm(2) 400 mu m by 400 mu m) can be about 19
   degrees C better in the proposed package than that achieved in the
   conventional chip package without TEC. The effects of trench, die
   thickness, and TEC misalignment on the cooling of the hot-spot are also
   discussed.

AB We have investigated the influence of the H2O vapour inlet temperature
   in the calcination on both the microstructure and superconducting
   properties of YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) films fabricated by the TFA-MOD
   method, from the viewpoint of the process control in the reel-to-reel
   system. Low critical current (I-c) values were obtained in the films
   prepared by introducing the H2O vapour at temperatures less than 200
   degrees C. XRD measurements and cross-sectional TEM observations
   suggest that the YBCO films calcined with the H2O vapour inlet
   temperature below 200 degrees C revealed a random orientation without
   the epitaxial growth of the YBCO phase grains. Consequently, it is
   necessary to introduce H2O vapour from temperatures higher than 250
   degrees C in calcination for fabrication of high performance YBCO
   tapes. In reel-to-reel system, it is important that the humidity

AB The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) off Australia's northeast coast is one of
   the natural wonders of the world. As a consequence it has high value,
   not only for biodiversity, but also for tourists who come to see the
   GBR and the biodiversity associated with it, bringing in over A$3.5B
   per annum to the Australian economy. However, there are a number of
   natural and anthropogenic factors that are threatening the health of
   the reef ecosystems. One of the major anthropogenic factors is the
   impact of sediments and nutrients that run off the land, via the
   rivers, into the lagoon of the reef. Extensive beef production is one
   of the major land uses of the GBR catchment, and brings in over $1B to
   the national economy annually and employs nearly 9,000 people, many of
   them in rural communities. Over 70% of terrestrial sediments and
   nutrients deposited in the GBR lagoon affecting the health of
   vulnerable reef ecosystems originate from the extensive grazing lands
   of Queensland's interior. Recent research indicates that the quantity
   of sediments and nutrients lost from these grazing lands is strongly
   dependent upon grazing management practices; grazing leads to
   degradation of soil and vegetation resources, reduced infiltration and
   vegetation production. This has led to a growing concern amongst the
   Australian public about the environmental performance of the beef
   industry and increasing pressures on graziers to change their
   management practices to decrease the off-farm impacts. Given the
   constraints within the system improvements in water quality draining
   into the GBR lagoon can best be achieved by demonstrating the
   productivity and economic benefits of science-based improved grazing
   management practices for graziers, leading to "AllWin" outcomes for all
   concerned. In the longer term, only when the range of stakeholders
   involved approach catchments as linked biophysical, social and economic
   systems, will truly integrated adaptive catchment management be applied
   to the GBR.

ID E-MESSENGER-RNA; THALASSEMIA; VARIANTS
AB Hemoglobin E ( beta 26Glu -> Lys) is the most common hemoglobin ( Hb)
   variant in Southeast Asia and the second most prevalent worldwide.
   However in India, it is prevalent in Bengal and the north- eastern
   region, but relatively rare in the rest of the country. Identification
   of this Hb variant is important, because the doubly heterozygous state
   for HbE and beta- thalassemia is characterized clinically by
   thalassemia major, a situation different from other compound
   heterozygous states for structural b- chain variants and b-
   thalassemia. Thus, the affected individual may be symptomatic and
   transfusion dependent at an early age. This paper reports four cases
   with Hb E trait, three cases with hemoglobin E disease and another four
   cases with E beta- thalassemia. Laboratory investigations are based on
   RBC indices and high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). A
   negative correlation has been found to exist between levels of HbA(2)
   and RBC indices including the MCV and MCH. A similar correlation has
   been seen between levels of HbF with Hb, RBC count, and MCV. The main
   aim is to increase the awareness of this relatively rare disorder, so
   that it can be included in the differential diagnosis of patients
   presenting clinically like thalassemia intermedia or thalassemia major.
   This awareness may also help in prenatal diagnosis, genetic counseling
   and clinical management. The clinical, hematological and laboratory
   features of this disorder are also discussed.

AB This study tackles the integration of six important selected forest
   values (soil conservation, carbon sequestration, visual quality,
   timber, water and oxygen production) into a linear programming-based
   forest management planning, model. All forest values were functionally
   linked to forest stand characteristics, and a number of forest
   management strategies were developed to evaluate the trade-offs among
   forest values. The outputs of each strategy are evaluated with a number
   of performance indicators, such as standing timber volume, harvested
   volume, ending forest inventory, areas harvested and basal area. The
   management strategies indicated that lon-term protection of forest
   ecosystems played an important role on the amount of carbon
   sequestration, soil conservation and visual quality values. The
   integration of timber volume policy constraints into timber-based
   forest management planning caused losses in timber volumes. Increased
   net carbon sequestration and dereased soil losses were attained at a
   significant cost, in terms of forgone timber harvest. Soil losses and
   water productions of forest ecosystems decreased, when residual basal
   area of forest stands increased. Clear-cuttings of forest stands have
   negative effects on visual quality. Higher timber growth rates resulted
   in more oxygen production.

AB The domestication of ayu Plecoglossus altivelis, in which breeding has
   been carried out for multiple generations without the introduction of
   exotic broodstock (purebred-styled cultivation), causes rapid loss of
   genetic variability, and is problematic for resource management
   programs. The introduction of wild paternity to enhance genetic
   variability was examined for its effects on the performance of the
   newly hybridized stock using the Gunma population (hatchery strain),
   which has been inbred for 29 generations since its origin. Principal
   component analysis showed that hybridization could modify the stock
   performance, moderately affecting behavior and morphometrics.
   Reinforcement of aggressiveness as well as transformation to a
   long-nosed shape in the hybrid population contributed revised
   performance that was acceptable to sports fishers as an artificial
   stock. To reduce genetic stress for native ayu populations, the
   introduction of wild paternity is proposed through sperm from wild
   caught specimens to hybridize with eggs from the pure-bred hatchery
   population.

TI Effects of cryptic mortality and the hidden costs of using length

DE catch and release; discard mortality; length limits; recruitment
   overfishing; spawning potential ratio; yield
ID RECREATIONAL FISHERIES; MARINE; COLLAPSE; ECOSYSTEMS; IMPACTS; SHARKS
AB Fishery collapses cause substantial economic and ecological harm, but
   common management actions often fail to prevent overfishing. Minimum
   length limits are perhaps the most common fishing regulation used in
   both commercial and recreational fisheries, but their conservation
   benefits can be influenced by discard mortality of fish caught and
   released below the legal length. We constructed a computer model to
   evaluate how discard mortality could influence the conservation utility
   of minimum length regulations. We evaluated policy performance across
   two disparate fish life-history types: short-lived high-productivity
   (SLHP) and long-lived low-productivity (LLLP) species. For the
   life-history types, fishing mortality rates and minimum length limits
   that we examined, length limits alone generally failed to achieve
   sustainability when discard mortality rate exceeded about 0.2 for SLHP
   species and 0.05 for LLLP species. At these levels of discard
   mortality, reductions in overall fishing mortality (e.g. lower fishing
   effort) were required to prevent recruitment overfishing if fishing
   mortality was high. Similarly, relatively low discard mortality rates
   (> 0.05) rendered maximum yield unobtainable and caused a substantial
   shift in the shape of the yield response surfaces. An analysis of
   fishery efficiency showed that length limits caused the simulated
   fisheries to be much less efficient, potentially exposing the target
   species and ecosystem to increased negative effects of the fishing
   process. Our findings suggest that for overexploited fisheries with
   moderate-to-high discard mortality rates, reductions in fishing
   mortality will be required to meet management goals. Resource managers
   should carefully consider impacts of cryptic mortality sources (e.g.
   discard mortality) on fishery sustainability, especially in
   recreational fisheries where release rates are high and effort is
   increasing in many areas of the world.

AB Treatment planning is a crucial and complex task in the social services
   industry. There is an increasing need for knowledge-based systems for
   supporting caseworkers in the decision-making of treatment planning.
   This paper presents a hybrid case-based reasoning approach for building
   a knowledge-based treatment planning system for adolescent early
   intervention of mental healthcare. The hybrid case-based reasoning
   approach combines aspects of case-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning
   and fuzzy theory. The knowledge base of case-based reasoning is a case
   base of client records consisting of documented experience while that
   for rule-based reasoning is a set of IF-THEN rules based on the
   experience of social service professionals. Fuzzy theory is adopted to
   deal with the uncertain nature of treatment planning. A prototype
   system has been implemented in a social services company and its
   performance is evaluated by a group of caseworkers. The results
   indicate that hybrid case-based reasoning has an enhanced performance
   and the knowledge-based treatment planning system enables caseworkers
   to construct more efficient treatment planning in less cost and less
   time.

AB Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the central cause in
   the development of anogenital warts, precancers and cancers of uterine
   cervix, and a major factor in the genesis of other malignancies of the
   lower anogenital and upper aerodligestive tracts. The burden of disease
   carries very high medical, financial and psychosocial costs. The role
   of prophylactic HPV vaccines in reducing the burden of disease is
   discussed in light of the results of multiple randomized, controlled
   trials conducted worldwide,in thousands of young females. The review
   discusses some of the issues that are still unknown, with respect to
   long-term vaccine performance, challenges to be overcome to achieve
   universal, mass prophylactic HPV vaccination, as well as the potential
   impact of the vaccines on primary screening for, and management of,
   HPV-related anogenital infection and disease.

ID COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; MODEL
AB In this paper, we study the relationship between factors influencing
   the strategic use of IT and business performance by conducting a survey
   of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). From the results of our
   survey we came to several conclusions which are presented here. First,
   IT investment has a significant impact on the strategic use of IT, and
   the strategic use of IT has a significant impact on business
   performance. Second, SME investment in IT and strategic use of IT are
   influenced by both the intensity of competition in the market
   environment and partnership with other organizations. Third, the
   support from the management group in SMEs is a core factor for IT
   investment and strategic use of IT. Finally, for SNIEs to use IT
   strategically and successfully, it is necessary to combine members'
   participation with a flexible organizational structure and culture.

AB Eco-physiological and plant performance responses and acclimation of
   Populus euphratica Oliv. to water release of the lower reaches of Tarim
   River, China were investigated. Three representative areas and 15
   transects were selected along the lower reaches of the Tarim River. The
   groundwater level and salt content as well as plant performance and the
   contents of proline, soluble sugar, and plant endogenous hormone (ABA,
   CTK) in leaves were monitored and analyzed before- and after-water
   release. The groundwater level was raised in different areas and
   transects by the water release program. The physiological stress to P.
   euphratica decreased after the water release. Our results suggested
   that the groundwater level in the studied region changed from -3.15 to
   -4.12 m, salt content of the groundwater from 67.15 to 72.65 mM, the
   proline content from 9.28 to 11.06 mM, the soluble sugar content from
   224.71 to 252.16 mM, the ABA content from 3.59 to 5.01 ng/(g FW), and
   the CK content from 4.01 to 4.56 ng/(g FW)- for the optimum growth and
   recover of P. euphratica indicated by the plant performance parameters,
   and the efficiency of water release was the highest.

AB Overseeding non-endophytic turfgrass lawns with endophytic turfgrass is
   considered promising for the development of integrated pest management
   programs in urban landscapes. In this context, a better understanding
   of the variability in the preference-performance response of insect
   herbivores exposed to endophytic grasses could be useful to develop
   efficient practices. Specifically, while endophytic varieties that are
   strongly toxic and avoided could provide good control of mobile pests,
   varieties that are toxic but not avoided could be more suitable for the
   control of sedentary pests. In this laboratory study, we investigated
   how the infection of 10 grass varieties by Neotyphodium endophytes
   affected the feeding performance and preference of newly hatched nymphs
   of the hairy chinch bug, Blissus leucoptcrus hirtus Montandon
   (Heteroptera: Lygaeidae), a common turfgrass pest in north-eastern USA.
   We found that endophytes generally induced a strong relationship
   between feeding performance and preference in this herbivore. However,
   two endophytic varieties did not conform to this relationship, with one
   variety being highly toxic but not avoided and the other less toxic but
   highly avoided. These results provide a solid basis to further explore
   the impacts of endophytic grasses on the dispersal and survival of
   insect pests in mixed stands of endophytic and non-endophytic plants.

AB Objective: To evaluate the long-term results of aggressive treatment of
   HCC recurrence.
   Methods: Two hundred and nine consecutive patients underwent hepatic
   resection for HCC in our hospital. Tumour recurrence was diagnosed in
   97 (51%) of the 190 patients with curative resection. Sixteen underwent
   hepatic resection: two right hepatectomies, one three-segmentectomy,
   one left hepatectomy, five two-segmentectomies, six segmental
   resections and one subsegmentectomy. Two patients with metastasis in
   the spine were submitted to a vertebral body resection. Twenty-five
   patients were treated with percutaneous ethanol injection or
   intra-arterial chemoembolization. Fifty-four patients with a poor
   performance status and liver function or multiple extra hepatic
   recurrences did not receive any treatment.
   Results: There were no operative deaths. The postoperative mortality
   rate was 5.5% (one patient). The cumulative overall survival after the
   second resection was respectively 89%, 46% and 31% at 1, 3 and 5 years.
   There was a significant difference in survival between patients treated
   with repeat resection and those submitted to a non-surgical or
   conservative treatment (p < 0.0001). There were no differences in
   operative deaths, postoperative mortality and morbidity between the
   first and second hepatic resection.
   Conclusions: Aggressive management with combined resection or loco
   regional therapy for intrahepatic recurrence and resection of isolated
   extra-hepatic recurrence may offer long-term survival in selected
   patients. Second liver resection for recurrence of HCC can be safely
   performed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating
   condition characterised by progressive, irreversible airflow
   limitation. The economic and social burden of the disease is enormous.
   The treatment of COPD is guided by the stage of the disease and is
   aimed primarily at control of symptoms. Bronchodilators are the
   cornerstone of pharmacological management of COPD. Short-acting
   bronchodilators (beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists and anticholinergics)
   have been available for many years and have been extensively studied as
   individual agents and in combination. When administered in combination,
   short-acting bronchodilators provide superior bronchodilation compared
   with individual agents given alone. However, the improvement in
   bronchodilation does not translate into an improvement in
   quality-of-life (QOL) indices. More recently, long-acting
   beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs) and anticholinergics have been
   introduced, and current guidelines recommend regular use of these
   agents in COPD of Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung
   Disease (GOLD) stage Id or more. Combining shortacting anticholinergics
   with LABAs for daily use has been evaluated, but this combination does
   not confer any advantage in terms of subjective improvement or
   prevention of exacerbations. Combining the long-acting anticholinergic
   tiotropium bromide with formoterol given once or twice daily improves
   airway obstruction and hyperinflation. However, the effects of
   combinations of long-acting bronchodilators on patients' symptom
   scores, QOL and exacerbations remain to be studied. Ultra-LABAs, which
   are in development, may enable use of a combination of long-acting
   bronchodilators in a single inhaler for once-daily use, thus
   simplifying the regimen.

AB Purpose of review Bladder cancer biomarker development has advanced
   significantly over the last decade, but has not yet been able to make a
   significant impact in the diagnosis and management of the disease. Many
   available markers are suitable, but do not meet the expectations of
   physicians and patients. Patients do not want to compromise accuracy in
   diagnosing bladder cancer for less-invasive tests. The review
   highlights the latest developments in bladder cancer biomarkers,
   including markers developed over the last year, and comments on the
   high standards placed on these markers which have delayed their
   widespread implementation into the urologic field.
   Recent findings New markers described in the last year include soluble
   Fas, urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 and human chorionic gonadotropin
   P type 11 genes. The latter two markers represent the contribution of
   genomic technology to this field. Also described are updates to known
   markers, including long-term follow-up of hematuria screening, recent
   studies in DNA methylation for bladder cancer diagnosis and patient
   perspectives on bladder tumor markers.
   Summary Biomarkers for bladder cancer have been intensively scrutinized
   over the last decade, but despite new findings and good performance
   characteristics, they are currently not accepted in clinical practice.

AB Objective: To investigate workflow in intensive care unit remote
   monitoring, a technology-driven practice that allows critical care
   specialists to perform proactive and continuous patient care from a
   remote site.
   Design: A time-and-motion study.
   Setting: Facility that remotely monitored 132 beds in nine intensive
   care units.
   Participants: Six physicians and seven registered nurses.
   Interventions: Participants were observed for 47 and 39 hrs,
   respectively.
   Measurements and Main Results: Clinicians' workflow was analyzed as
   goal-oriented tasks and activities. Major variables of interest
   included the times spent on different types of tasks and activities,
   the frequencies of accessing various information resources, and the
   occurrence and management of interruptions in workflow. Physicians
   spent 70%, 3%, 3%, and 24% of their time on patient monitoring,
   collaboration, system maintenance, and administrative/social/personal
   tasks, respectively. For nurses, the time allocations were 46%, 3%, 4%,
   and 17%, respectively. Nurses spent another 30% of their time
   maintaining health records. In monitoring patients, physicians spent
   more percentage times communicating with others than the nurses (13%
   vs. 7%, p =.026) and accessed the in-unit clinical information system
   more frequently (42 vs. 14 times per hour, p =.027), while nurses spent
   more percentage times monitoring real-time vitals (16% vs. 2%, p
   =.012). Physicians' and nurses' workflows were interrupted at a rate of
   2.2 and 7.5 times per hour (p <.001), with an average duration of 101
   and 45 secs, respectively (p =.006). The sources of interruptions were
   significantly different for physicians and nurses (p <.001).
   Conclusions. Physicians' and nurses' task performance and information
   utilization reflect the distributed nature of work organization in
   intensive care unit remote monitoring. Workflow interruption, clinical
   information system usability, and collaboration with bedside caregivers
   are the major issues that may affect the quality and efficiency of
   clinicians' work in this particular critical care setting.

AB We conducted this study to find genetic evidence to distinguish the
   members of Pacific abalone species complex (Haliotis discus hannai, H.
   discus discus, H. madaka, and H. gigantea) based on microsatellite DNA
   markers, illustrating the potential of microsatellites for
   species-assignment. First, we addressed the transferability of H.
   discus hannai microsatellites to the three other members of Pacific
   abalone and five additional species (H. diversicolor aquatilis, H.
   midae, H. corrugata, H. fulgens, and H. rubra). Second, using the
   microsatellites we applied two types of individual assignment testing
   (the distance-based assignment and Bayesian model-based clustering) to
   individuals from the Pacific abalone species. A total of 24
   microsatellites were subjected to PCR trials for nine Haliotis species,
   and the cross-species amplification performance of these markers turned
   out to drop precipitously even for less divergent congeners. Within the
   Pacific abalone species complex, four of the 24 markers were not
   transferable to H. gigantea, suggesting a solid genetic boundary
   between H. gigantea and H. discus hannai, H. discus discus, and H.
   madaka. Among the three latter abalones, both assignment tests achieved
   approximately 90% or more success rate of assignment. The feasibility
   of the microsatellite markers to classify species sheds light on the
   genetic management of the Pacific abalone species complex.

AB Scheduling decisions constitute the last decision-making phase of the
   production planning and control process. From the industrial side, the
   adoption of highly reactive and efficient scheduling and control
   systems strongly affects the level of productivity and utilization of a
   manufacturing system, particularly under the pressure of shortened
   product cycles, reduced batch sizes and a broader variety of items to
   be produced. In the meanwhile, from the research side, there has been a
   considerable amount of works done in the area of manufacturing systems
   control, even if they still remain "unheard voices" in industry. Hence,
   in the scheduling world there is a risk of miscommunication between
   academics and industrial users.
   Aim of the paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the rationale,
   the conceptual model, the development efforts and first applicative
   experiences of the Benchmarking Service, a research initiative which
   has been carried out within the activities of the Special Interest
   Group on Benchmarking and Performance Measurement of the IMS Network of
   Excellence. In particular, the paper details the PMS-ESS conceptual
   framework developed for assessing the level of quality of a scheduling
   solution in terms of efficiency, robustness and flexibility. (c) 2007

ID MEASUREMENT SYSTEM-DESIGN; MANAGEMENT; EVOLUTION
AB There has been a lot of research focused on performance measurement in
   general. In the last few decades a number of successful studies were
   reported in implementing performance measurement. However, very few
   studies were reported on performance measurement in businesses
   operating in construction industry. Hence the objective of this paper
   is to implement performance measurement in a business operating in the
   construction sector using action research. This study has shown that by
   introducing small changes in the construction industry through a
   structured performance measurement system (PMS) with appropriate
   management information systems (MIS), there are significant
   improvements such as successfully addressing all stakeholder
   requirements, focusing on critical improvement areas as well as
   bringing cultural changes (proactive management and decision making).

AB This research aims to investigate the relationship between performance
   measurement system (PMS) and management information system (MIS)
   adopting a company life-cycle approach. The scope is to show if and how
   MIS influences PMS and vice versa. The investigation is carried out
   using the case study, methodology in Italian and Scottish small and
   medium enterprises (SMEs). The empirical results are synthesized in two
   theoretical propositions.
   The first proposition underlines the presence of two circular
   relationships between PMS, MIS and organizational capability. The first
   relationship is that: PMS implementation and use promote development in
   organizational capability, and that improvements in organizational
   capability supports PMS implementation and use. The second relationship
   is that; advanced MIS create a favourable context for PMS
   implementation and use. and that PMS implementation and use encourages
   investments in MIS.
   The second proposition emphasizes that company maturity has a relevant
   impact on MIS and PMS development where mature organizations are able
   to recognize their needs and are able to design effective MIS
   responding to PMS requirements. On the other hand, in less mature
   organizations an external stimulus is essential for supporting MIS
   investment and PMS implementation and use. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

AB When competitiveness, responsiveness and customer satisfaction are
   keywords of a successful management in a business area, companies
   cannot work in an autonomous way anymore. They have to get closer to
   their supply chain partners and to optimize their relations, to
   interface and to integrate their information systems and
   decision-making in order to synchronize product flows and activities.
   In this context, the general framework proposed in this paper
   characterizes the performance of the collaboration in supply chains and
   it is based on two models: a collaboration characterization model and a
   collaboration-oriented performance model, both based on main supply
   chain business processes. The framework proposed has been instanced and
   validated on an industrial case study. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The after-sales activities are nowadays acknowledged as a relevant
   source of revenue, profit and competitive advantage in most
   manufacturing industries. Top and middle management, therefore, should
   focus on the definition of a structured business performance
   measurement system for the after-sales business. In addition, since
   many actors are involved along the after-sale service supply chain, an
   integrated and multi-attribute set of measures needs to be designed
   consistently at every level of the supply chain. Nonetheless, little
   attention was devoted by scientific and managerial literature to this
   topic. The paper aims at filling this gap, and proposes an integrated
   framework for the after-sales network performance measurement, and
   provides an empirical application to two automotive case companies and
   their official service network. The cases show that performance
   measurement systems of different supply chain actors should be aligned
   in order to achieve strategic consistency. In particular, the
   performance of different actors at the process level of the framework
   concurs in determining the after-sales service overall performance
   towards the final customer. In addition, linkages at other levels
   (mainly the business and activity ones) may be needed or helpful in
   ensuring consistency between strategic and operational objectives,
   inside the organisations and thus for the whole supply chain. (c) 2007

AB This study deals with the supply chain (SC) performance formalization.
   We propose to build performance measurement systems (PMSs) by linking
   an overall performance expression to elementary ones. The overall
   performance is associated to a global objective whose break-down
   provides elementary objectives. Elementary performances are thus
   aggregated in a corollary way. The problem in the design of such PMS's,
   by the break-down/aggregation model, concerns both the coherent
   elementary performance expressions and the definition of the links
   between them. Some answers are proposed in the literature, such as the
   weighted mean aggregation operator, to handle hierarchical links, the
   Choquet integral operator. for taking interactions into account. As
   global frameworks, the AHP or MACBETH methodologies are suggested. By
   considering the SCOR model break-down, we propose to extend here the
   proposed approaches for expressing the overall performance of a SC. An
   aggregation methodology. based on the Choquet integral operator and
   MACBETH framework, is thus adopted. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Today, the enterprise must cooperate to survive in an increasingly
   competitive context. This co-operation is carried out by organisations
   in networks through the supply chain (SC). In order to do so,
   enterprises must be interoperable. In order to reach interoperability,
   the system must eradicate heterogeneity. This paper aims at presenting
   the problems of heterogeneity from two different points of view:
   semantic and organisational. In the first part, the paper exposes the
   problems of heterogeneity from the two points of view. This part
   insists on the weak alien problem resolution for the semantics. In the
   second part, the synchronisation and standardisation of practices of
   business processes are presented in order to solve a part of the
   problem of organisation heterogeneity. The third part presents the use
   of the performance measurement system to manage the evolution of the
   enterprises towards interoperability, i.e. the implementation and
   exploitation of the principles exposed previously. Then, the last part
   presents an application of the ECOGRAI method and implementation using
   a software tool in the frame of interoperability between manufacturing
   and maintenance companies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Users play an important role in the information security performance of

   Interviews of users at an IT-company and a bank were qualitatively
   analyzed in order to explore users' experience of information security
   and their personal role in the information security work. The main
   patterns of the study were: (1) users state to be motivated for
   information security work, but do not perform many individual security
   actions; (2) high information security workload creates a conflict of
   interest between functionality and information security; and (3)
   documented requirements of expected information security behaviour and
   general awareness campaigns have little effect alone on user behaviour
   and awareness. The users consider a user-involving approach to be much
   more effective for influencing user awareness and behaviour. (c) 2006

AB Managers of sewer systems are faced with their infrastructure system
   ageing. Even when they are conscious about the needs of maintenance to
   keep the system in a good condition, they lack efficient methods and
   tools that may help them in taking appropriate decisions. One can say
   that no really satisfactory and efficient tool exists, enabling the
   optimization of Inspection, Maintenance, or Rehabilitation (IMR)
   strategies on such systems. Sewer managers and researchers have been
   involved for many years in the French National Research Project for
   Renewal of Non Man Entry Sewer System (RERAU-Rehabilitation des Reseaux
   d'Assainissement Urbains, in French) to improve their knowledge of
   these systems and the management policies. During the RERAU project, a
   specific action has been dedicated to the modeling of asset ageing and
   maintenance. A special attention has been dedicated to the description
   of defects and dysfunctions, to the evaluation of performances and its
   modeling, accounting for its various dimensions (from the point of view
   of the manager, of the user, of the environment...). After having
   defined an Index of Technical Performance (ITp), we will introduce the
   Index of Technical and Economic Performance (ITEp) that is a combined
   measure of performance (including social costs) and technical costs.
   This index provides an objective standard tool for managers to compare
   different alternatives. It is used in the article to compare some
   simple IMR strategies. It sets the basis of a new method for no-man
   entry sewer system management, enabling us to analyze the
   profitableness of investment in terms of both technical and economic
   performance.

AB With the growing use of mobile communication devices, the management of
   such technologies is of increasing importance. The registration area
   planning (RAP) problem examines the grouping of cells comprising a
   personal communication services (PCs) network into contiguous blocks in
   an effort to reduce the cost of managing the location of the devices
   operating on the network, in terms of bandwidth. This study introduces
   a hybridized grouping genetic algorithm (HGGA) to obtain cell
   formations for the RAP problem. The hybridization is accomplished by
   adding a tabu search-based improvement operator to a traditional
   grouping genetic algorithm (GGA). Results indicate that significant
   performance gains can be realized by hybridizing the algorithm,
   especially for larger problem instances. The HGGA is shown to
   consistently outperform the traditional GGA on problems of size greater
   than 19 cells. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we develop a queueing model of fuzzy threshold-based
   space priority buffer management and study its performance under
   realistic conditions. It applies a matrix-analytic approach to analyze
   the relevant performance measure, including the packet loss probability
   of high-priority traffic and the packet loss probability of
   low-priority traffic. Based on the proposed framework, we explore the
   properties of the fuzzy threshold-based space priority buffer
   management scheme. Numerical results reveal that the fixed threshold
   scheme, through its abrupt nature, causes a relatively higher
   low-priority packet drop. Intuitively, the fuzzy threshold adapts well
   to different input traffic conditions and packet loss rate requirements
   of high-priority packet, yielding a lower packet loss probability for
   low-priority packet. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of
   atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) restorations placed in school
   children in China over a 6-year period. Methods: This study was
   implemented in 1996 and 294 ART restorations were placed in 197
   children aged 12-13 years by five assistant dentists in four schools.
   Standard ART procedures and instruments were used combined with a
   high-strength glass-ionomer restorative material. One examiner
   evaluated the restorations annually using the ART criteria while at 5
   years an independent external examiner used US Public Health Service
   (USPHS) criteria. Results: Fifty-eight per cent of the restorations
   were followed for 6 years. At the 6-year evaluation examination, 76%
   and 59% of the small and large restorations respectively were present
   and were without major wear or defect (P < 0.01). Similar results were
   obtained when using the USPHS criteria. Results of a multilevel
   survival analysis show that the correlation between restoration failure
   and operator was small but failure of restorations placed in the same
   child was substantial. Net wear of the small and large restorations
   after 6 years were 176 and 172 mu m respectively (P > 0.05).
   Conclusions: The 6-year survival rate of the class I ART restorations
   in this study, especially the smaller ones, was satisfactory. This
   suggests that the ART approach can be used in the school setting to
   improve the oral health of large populations of underserved children.

TI A MAC layer power management scheme for efficient energy delay tradeoff
   in a WLAN
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE WLAN; dynamic programming; optimization problem; "Sleep" scheduling
   algorithm
AB Energy efficient operation is of paramount importance for
   battery-powered wireless nodes. In an effort to conserve energy,
   standard protocols for WLANs have the provision for wireless nodes to
   "sleep" periodically. In this paper we first consider the problem of
   optimizing the timing and duration of the sleep state of a single
   wireless node (or user) with the objective of minimizing power
   consumption with respect to a QoS constraint. The QoS parameter that we
   have focused on is average packet delay. Using a Dynamic Programming
   formulation, coupled with a duality argument, we solve the optimization
   problem numerically. Using a branching process analysis, we were able
   to derive closed form expressions for the optimal sleep duration, as
   well as the associated minimal rate of power consumption. We show that
   the optimal power cost derived from the one-user Dynamic Programming
   (DP) formulation provides a lower bound to the average power
   consumption for the multiple user case. To gain better insight into the
   optimal sleep policy we also formulate and solve a two-user
   optimization problem, similar to the one user case. Although the
   complexity of the DP approach grows very quickly with the number of
   users, the insights gained from the DP approach led us to design a
   simple, centralized, adaptive algorithm for assigning the sleep
   duration of an arbitrary number of wireless nodes operating in an
   infrastructure mode served by a single Access Point (AP). Our algorithm
   adapts dynamically to the packet arrival rate and statistics, as well
   as the tolerable average packet delay. We describe two different
   service policies - the Round Robin scheme and the Shortest Sleep First
   (SSF) scheme. The Round Robin scheme is the preferred service policy
   when all wireless nodes in the system have the same packet arrival
   statistics and the same tolerable average delay. The SSF Scheme is
   designed mainly for a system where nodes are heterogeneous with
   different tolerable average packet delay. Simulation results show that
   the power efficiency of our algorithm is comparable to the bound on
   performance that is obtained from the one-user dynamic programming
   formulation. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Three to 12 evaluations of clinical performance using the mini-clinical
   evaluation exercise (Mini-CEX) (n=124) or direct observation of
   procedural skills (DOPS) (n=21) were performed on 27 trainees working
   in an NHS neurology department. The communications/counselling skills
   subdomain was scored in 64 evaluations. For Mini-CEX the focus was on
   gathering data (22%), diagnosis (31%), management (34%) and counselling
   (7%) (focus not recorded in 6%). For DOPS, lumbar puncture was the most
   common evaluated procedure (57%). Mini-CEX evaluations lasted 23.8
   minutes (10.6) (mean, sd) and DOPS 25.9 minutes (12.6). Mini-CEX scores
   for overall competence and communication skills were mean 5.99 (sd
   0.95, range 4-8) and 5.98 (sd 1.21, range 3-9) and for DOPS 5.71 (sd
   0.90, range 4-8) both on scales of I to 9. Overall trainee competence
   and communication scores increased with year of training (p < 0.001, p
   < 0.004 univariate analysis). Assessors undertook up to three or four
   assessments in a session. Assessors and trainees considered that the
   observation and feedback had been 'very' or 'quite' useful in providing
   a relevant element of assessment. These assessments were feasible and
   useful in a neurology department and provided some evidence for
   increasing performance with trainee seniority. More assessor time
   (approximately one hour) than trainee time (24-26 min) was needed for
   each assessment undertaken.

   models. In principle, RL can automatically learn high-quality
   management policies without an explicit performance model or traffic
   model, and with little or no built-in system specific knowledge. In our
   original work (Das, R., Tesauro, G., Walsh, W.E.: IBM Research, Tech.
   Rep. RC23802 (2005), Tesauro, G.: In: Proc. of AAAI-05, pp. 886-891
   (2005), Tesauro, G., Das, R., Walsh, W.E., Kephart, J.O.: In: Proc. of
   ICAC-05, pp. 342-343 (2005)) we showed the feasibility of using online
   RL to learn resource valuation estimates (in lookup table form) which
   can be used to make high-quality server allocation decisions in a
   multi-application prototype Data Center scenario. The present work
   shows how to combine the strengths of both RL and queuing models in a
   hybrid approach, in which RL trains offline on data collected while a
   queuing model policy controls the system. By training offline we avoid
   suffering potentially poor performance in live online training. We also
   now use RL to train nonlinear function approximators (e.g. multi-layer
   perceptrons) instead of lookup tables; this enables scaling to
   substantially larger state spaces. Our results now show that, in both
   open-loop and closed-loop traffic, hybrid RL training can achieve
   significant performance improvements over a variety of initial
   model-based policies. We also find that, as expected, RL can deal
   effectively with both transients and switching delays, which lie
   outside the scope of traditional steady-state queuing theory.

DE acoustic signal analysis; case study; grid; security
AB The LTER Grid Pilot Study was conducted by the National Center for
   Supercomputing Applications, the University of New Mexico, and Michigan
   State University, to design and build a prototype grid for the
   ecological community. The featured grid application, the Biophony Grid
   Portal, manages acoustic data from field sensors and allows researchers
   to conduct real-time digital signal processing analysis on
   high-performance systems via a web-based portal. Important
   characteristics addressed during the study include the management,
   access, and analysis of a large set of field collected acoustic
   observations from microphone sensors, single signon, and data
   provenance. During the development phase of this project, new features
   were added to standard grid middleware software and have already been
   successfully leveraged by other, unrelated grid projects. This paper
   provides an overview of the Biophony Grid Portal application and
   requirements, discusses considerations regarding grid architecture and
   design, details the technical implementation, and summarizes key
   experiences and lessons learned that are generally applicable to all
   developers and administrators in a grid environment.

AB Objective-To issue a recommendation on the types and amounts of
   physical activity needed to improve and maintain health in older adults.
   Participants-A panel of scientists with expertise in public health,
   behavioral science, epidemiology, exercise science, medicine, and
   gerontology.
   Evidence-The expert panel reviewed existing consensus statements and
   relevant evidence from primary research articles and reviews of the
   literature.
   Process: After drafting a recommendation for the older adult population
   and reviewing drafts of the Updated Recommendation from the American
   College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Heart Association
   (AHA) for Adults, the panel issued a final recommendation on physical
   activity for older adults.
   Summary-The recommendation for older adults is similar to the updated
   ACSM/AHA recommendation for adults, but has several important
   differences including: the recommended intensity of aerobic activity
   takes into account the older adult's aerobic fitness; activities that
   maintain or increase flexibility are recommended; and balance exercises
   are recommended for older adults at risk of falls. In addition, older
   adults should have an activity plan for achieving recommended physical
   activity that integrates preventive and therapeutic recommendations.
   The promotion of physical activity in older adults should emphasize
   moderate-intensity aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity,
   reducing sedentary behavior, and risk management.

AB Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranked the second among the
   causes of cancer mortality in China since the 1990s. Up to now,
   medication still plays an important role in the treatment of HCC. The
   therapies based on the allicin as a potential chemopreventive analog
   although is in its infancy at the present time, may have a significant
   role in the future management of HCC. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS) is a
   natural compound derived from garlic. In this study, we investigated
   the inhibitory effects of hepatic targeted polybutylcyanoacrylate
   nanoparticles of diallyl trisulfide (DATS-PBCA-NP) on orthotopic
   transplanted HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma in nude mice.
   Methods DATS-PBCA-NP were detected by transmission electron microscope
   (TEM) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The orthotopic
   transplantation HCC models were established by implanting HCC HepG2
   xenograft bits under the envelope of the mice liver. Successful models
   (n=29) were divided into 4 groups: normal saline (NS), empty
   nanoparticles (EN), DATS and DATS-PBCA-NP were intravenously
   administered to the mice respectively for 2 weeks. In vivo antitumor
   efficacy was evaluated by the measurement of tumor volume. Terminal
   deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
   assay and protein levels of apoptosis and cell proliferation proteins
   by immunoblotting in tumor tissues were performed to elucidate the
   possible mechanism.
   Results DATS-PBCA-NP possessed smooth and round appearance, dispersed
   well, and released in vitro in accord with double phase kinetics model.
   DATS-PBCA-NP changed the tissue/organ distribution of DATS in vivo. The
   successful rate of tumor implantation was 100%. Intravenous
   administration of DATS-PBCA-NP significantly retarded the growth of
   orthotopically transplanted hepatoma in BALB/c nude mice (compared with
   the other three groups, all P < 0.05) without causing weight loss (P >
   0.05). TUNEL staining showed that the tumors from DATS-PBCA-NP treated
   mice exhibited a markedly higher apoptotic index compared with control
   tumors. Western blot analysis of tumor tissue revealed that the
   down-regulated expression of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
   and Bcl-2 proteins in DATS-PBCA-NP group, and there were no significant
   differences in the expression of Fas, FasL and Bax proteins among the
   four groups (P > 0.05).
   Conclusions DATS-PBCA-NP has good prolonged release effect in vivo and
   hepatic-targeted activity, and significant anti-tumor effect on the
   orthotopic transplantation HCC model in mice in association with the
   suppression of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis of tumor
   cells. These advantages are probably due to their liver targeting
   characteristics and consequently bring a higher anti-tumor activity.

AB Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a pneumonia
   severity index (PSI) score in risk class V (PSI-V) is a potentially
   life-threatening condition, yet the majority of patients are not
   admitted to the ICU. The aim of this study was to characterize CAP
   patients in PSI-V to determine the risk factors for ICU admission and
   mortality, and to assess the performance of CAP severity scores in this
   population.
   Methods: Prospective observational study including hospitalized adults
   with CAP in PSI-V from 1996 to 2003. Clinical and laboratory data,
   microbiological findings, and outcomes were recorded. The PSI score;
   modified American Thoracic Society (ATS) score; the confusion, urea,
   respiratory rate, low BP (CURB) score, and CURB plus age of 65 years
   score were calculated. A reduced score based on the acute illness
   variables contained in the PSI was also obtained.
   Results: A total of 457 patients were included in the study (mean [+/-
   SD] age, 79 +/- 11 years), of whom 92 (20%) were admitted to the ICU.
   Patients in the ward were older (mean age, 82 +/- 10 vs 70 +/- 10
   years, respectively) and had more comorbidities. ICU patients
   experienced significantly more acute organ failures. The mortality rate
   was higher in ICU patients, but also was high for non-ICU patients (37%
   vs; 20%, respectively; p = 0,003). A low level of consciousness (odds
   ratio [OR], 3.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2 to 5) and shock (OR,
   24.7; 95% C1, 14 to 44) were associated with a higher risk of death.
   The modified ATS severity rule had the best accuracy in predicting ICU
   admission and mortality.
   Conclusions: Most CAP patients PSI-V were treated on a hospital ward.
   Those admitted to the ICU were younger and had findings of more acute
   illness. The PSI performed well as a mortality prediction tool but was
   less appropriate for guiding site-of-care decisions.

TI Advances in maize breeding through the cumulative complex improvement
   of sources
SO CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Zea mays; diversity; genetic resources; heterosis sources
ID US HYBRID CORN; UNITED-STATES; EUROPE
AB Maize breeding, on which the future of maize production is based, can
   be expected to undergo further important developments in the 2 1 (st)
   century. Opportunities for development are latent in a more scientific
   approach to production methods and in the better exploitation of the
   available genetic resources. There is no lack of favourable gene
   combinations contributing to higher yield (e.g. 20-22 t/ha). However,
   the genes and gene combinations controlling the improvement and
   stabilisation of performance are unfortunately scattered over various
   different races, varieties and individual plants, where they occur at
   low frequency. Combination breeding and, more recently, cumulative
   source management are designed to collect these genes and concentrate
   them in special parental lines and heterosis sources. The pure line
   method has been a basic procedure in maize breeding for the last 100
   years, and is likely to remain so for the next 100 years. Combination
   breeding and cumulative source management are an integral part of this
   method. The concentration of favourable genes has been facilitated to
   an unexpected extent by the use of this method. When breeding
   open-pollinated varieties all the gene combinations required had to be
   collected into a single population, while in the case of heterosis
   breeding it is sufficient if the inale and female parents each contain
   half the required gene combinations. These are then combined
   automatically in the course of crossing. Over the last 20 years too
   little attention has been paid to the breeding of basic material, so
   the number of heterosis sources has declined and some have become
   eroded due to unsupervised mixing. There have been few reports on the
   development of new heterosis sources vying in quality with earlier
   sources. In the course of hybrid maize breeding, closely related
   pedigrees have been crossed to develop new elite lines in the hope of
   quick results, Due to the lack of substantial initial divergence this
   is unlikely to result in any great increase in yield. Authoritative
   opinions consider this to be the reason for the slower rate of yield
   increase, and for the very small differences now existing between the
   yield levels of rival hybrids.

AB Chemical process systems often need to respond to frequently changing
   product demands. This motivates the determination of optimal
   transitions, subject to specification and operational constraints.
   However, direct implementation of optimal input trajectories would, in
   general, result in offset in the presence of disturbances and
   plant/model mismatch. This paper considers reference trajectory
   optimization of processes controlled by constrained model predictive
   control (MPC). Consideration of the closed-loop dynamics of the
   MPC-controlled process in the reference trajectory optimization results
   in a multi-level optimization problem. A solution strategy is applied
   in which the MPC quadratic programming subproblems are replaced by
   their Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, resulting in a
   single-level mathematical program with complementarity constraints
   (MPCC). The performance of the method is illustrated through
   application to two case studies, the second of which considers
   economically optimal grade transitions in a polymerization process.

   COLEOPTERA; CONSEQUENCES; SELECTION; QUALITY; FAUNA
AB In order to assess the management success of river rehabilitation
   measurements it is necessary to have representative target species and
   objective statistical methods. In this study we, tested the validity of
   habitat suitability models for the riparian carabid beetle Bembidion
   velox in the evaluation of river bank management along the River Elbe,
   Germany. On the basis of seven independent data sets from different
   sites and years we have proven the robustness of logistic regression
   models with respect to their explanatory and predictive power and their
   applicability in the field. All models had robust explanatory power and
   described a strong association of B. velox with semi-terrestrial sandy
   open soil habitats. Transfers of model results for adult beetles to
   their larvae and vice versa were highly significant with "sand content"
   and "stem distance" as the main habitat factors for both life stages.
   To broaden the local explanatory power towards general predictions we
   performed model cross-validation in space and time. Spatial transfers
   produced models with excellent discrimination properties, measured by
   Area Under Curve (AUC) values of Receiver Operating Characteristics
   (ROC) plots, independent of sampling designs and trapping methodology.
   However, the applicability of habitat models for B. velox is defined by
   the validity period, as the availability of suitable habitats for this
   species is highly temporally variable and dependent on water level.
   Model transfers between species also demonstrated that the chosen
   target species is representative for carabids with similar distribution
   patterns, as the single species model had high predictive power for the
   occurrence of a multi-species carabid group.

AB Patient safety research is hampered by lack of a clear taxonomy and
   difficulty in detecting errors. Preventable adverse events occur in
   medicine because of human fallibility, complexity, system deficiencies
   and vulnerabilities in defensive barriers. To make medicine safer there
   needs to be a culture change, beginning with the leadership. Latent
   systems deficiencies must be identified and corrected before they cause
   harm. Defensive barriers can be improved to intercept errors before
   patients are harmed. Strategies include: (1) providing leadership at
   all levels; (2) respecting human limits in equipment and process
   design; (3) functioning collaboratively in a team model with mutual
   respect; (4) creating a learning environment where errors can be
   analyzed without fear of retribution; and (5) anticipating the
   unexpected with analysis of high-risk processes and well-designed
   contingency plans. The ideal of a 100% safe health-care system is
   unattainable, but there must be continual improvement.

DT Article
AB The key objective in the design of a new radio interface for
   next-generation wireless communications is to develop a scalable and
   adaptable radio access system that will support the challenging
   requirements for systems beyond third generation (B3G). The new radio
   interface must support a wide range of usage and radio environments and
   provide a significant improvement in performance and quality of service
   to meet future market demands. In addition, the new radio interface
   should also make optimalum use of spectral resources through techniques
   such as multiple antennas and advanced resource management. Bell Labs
   is currently collaborating with a strong consortium of major players
   including service providers, manufacturers, and academic organizations
   in the wireless field, within the framework of the European
   Commission-funded Wireless World Initiative-New Radio (WINNER) project.
   By studying the requirements, enabling technologies, and identifying
   the critical issues, WINNER can help build a consensus of a system
   concept and regulatory requirements, and encourage new opportunities
   for convergence. (c) 2007 Alcatel-Lucent.

TI Monitoring infrastructure for converged networks and services
SO BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
AB Network convergence is enabling service providers to deploy a wide
   range of services such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Internet
   Protocol television (IPTV), and push-to-talk on the same underlying IP
   networks. Each service has unique performance requirements from the
   network, and IP networks have not been designed to satisfy these
   diverse requirements easily. These requirements drive the need for a
   robust, scalable, and easy-to-use network management platform that
   enables service providers to monitor and manage their networks to
   provide the necessary quality, availability, and security. In this
   paper, we describe monitoring mechanisms that give service providers
   critical information on the performance of their networks at a
   per-user, per-service granularity in real time. This allows the service
   providers to ensure that their networks adequately satisfy the
   requirements of the various services. We present various methods to
   acquire data, which can be analyzed to determine the performance of the
   network. This platform enables service providers to offer carrier grade
   services over their converged networks, giving their customers a
   high-quality experience. (c) 2007 Alcatel-Lucent.

DE flexible pavement; E-modulus; falling weight deflectometer (FWD);

AB The main objective of the research project was to derive the equation
   for calculating the pavement equivalent E-modulus on the basis of the
   Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) deflection measurement data to be
   used in the Estonian Pavement Management System (EPMS) for network and
   project level analysis so, that the determined values are comparable
   with the Estonian flexible pavement design procedure 2001-52. In 1999,
   32 and in 2001 additional 19 FWD test sites were chosen on actual
   pavement structures to perform FWD measurements annually, once or twice
   per month from early spring until late autumn. FWD measurement data
   were analysed mathematically and the results were compared with the
   Estonian flexible pavement design procedure.
   The research project results in the following: The quantitative
   methodology for evaluating the qualitative characteristics of the
   pavement is determined on the basis of the Cobb-Douglas equation,
   taking into account at a time practically an unlimited number of
   factors influencing the pavement structural condition.
   The relationship between the pavement equivalent elastic modulus
   calculated according to the Estonian flexible pavement design procedure
   2001-52 and based on the FWD measured deflection is determined. The
   equation for calculating of the pavement equivalent E-modulus on the
   basis of the FWD deflection data to be used in the EPMS is detived.
   The correction factors for the pavement equivalent E-modulus, taking
   into account the month of the FWD measurement performance, moist-Lire
   conditions and road embankment height at the FWD test site, are
   mathematically based on statistical data determined for Estonian
   conditions.

   HOUSED SOWS; ETHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS; PREPARTUM BEHAVIOR
AB The use of farrowing crates is increasingly questioned from an animal
   welfare point of view. Even so, since a number of attempts to develop
   loose farrowing systems have been unsuccessful, leading to high levels
   of piglet mortality due in the main to crushing, many farmers remain
   sceptical as to whether or not alternative systems can be viable. On
   the other hand, several European countries have introduced legislation
   requiring loose farrowing systems, thus promoting research into this
   type of housing and allowing for performance studies based on large
   samples of commercial forms. As a consequence of these recent
   developments, we think it timely to reconsider the evidence available
   on loose farrowing systems. In our review, we first address the normal
   peri-parturient behaviour of domestic pigs, as well as studies
   comparing behaviour and stress physiology in sows kept in both crates
   and loose systems during farrowing. We then review approaches taken to
   develop alternative farrowing systems in different countries, and focus
   lastly on pen, piglet and sow characteristics that contribute to piglet
   survival in loose farrowing systems. Taking scientific evidence as well
   as practical experience into account, we conclude that piglet mortality
   in loose farrowing systems need not exceed that of crate systems. To
   obtain good performance results, sows due to farrow should be kept
   individually in sufficiently large pens, structured for preference into
   a nest area and an activity area. Furthermore, both management and
   breeding aspects, resulting in high piglet viability and good maternal
   behaviour, are essential to achieve high production in loose farrowing
   systems.

AB Millions of wild mammals are trapped annually for fur, pest control and
   wildlife management. Ensuring the welfare of trapped individuals can
   only be achieved by trapping methods that meet accepted standards of
   animal welfare. At the international level, the assessment of
   mechanical properties of killing and restraining traps is set out in
   two documents published by the International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO). Few traps currently in use have been tested
   according to the ISO standards and, in addition, new traps have been
   designed and old traps modified since the publication of the standards.
   In this paper we review trapping methods used in Europe and North
   America to see whether they meet the ISO standards and examine ways to
   improve the welfare performance of traps. In addition, international
   legislation is assessed to determine whether this ensures a sufficient
   level of welfare for trapped animals. Finally, trapping practices used
   in academic research are reviewed. We conclude that many of the
   practices commonly used to trap mammals cannot be considered humane.
   Current legislation fails to ensure an acceptable level of welfare for
   a large number of captured animals. New welfare standards for trapping
   wild mammals need to be established so that in future a minimum level
   of welfare is guaranteed for all trapped individuals.

AB Sixty female Holstein calves were used to study the effect of mannan
   oligosaccharides (MOS) on performance, health, bacteria fecal counts
   and Cryptosporidium presence in feces of calves following an
   enhanced-growth feeding program. Calves were divided in two groups:
   supplementation of 4 g/d of MOS on milk replacer (MR-M) or
   non-supplemented milk replacer (MR-C). After 1 wk of adaptation to milk
   replacer (MR) at 180 g/kg dilution, calves were fed: 41/d of MR from 1
   to 7 d, 61/d from 8 to 14 d, 71/d from 15 to 21 d, 61/d from 22 to 28
   d, and 31/d once daily in the afternoon meal from 29 to 34 d. Calves
   were weaned at 35 d of study, and were offered water and starter ad
   libitum until 41 d of study. Starter and MR intake were recorded daily.
   Calves were weighed weekly, and blood samples were obtained at 1, 3, 5
   and 6 wk of study to determine haptoglobin serum concentrations.
   Moreover, total fecal counts of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia
   coli, and for presence of Salmonella spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were
   determined from fecal samples obtained at 1, 2, and 3 wk of study.
   There were no differences in body weight, but starter intake tended to
   be greater (P=0.09) during the pre-weaning period (0.34 versus 0.28 +/-
   0.023 kg/d) and greater (P < 0.01) the week after weaning (1.94 versus
   1.71 +/- 0.044 kg/d) in MR-M compared with MR-C calves. However, there
   were no differences in average daily gain between treatments during the
   pre-weaning (0.91 versus 0.90 +/- 0.017 kg/d), and the post-weaning
   period (1.20 versus 1.22 +/- 0.074 kg/d) between MR-C and MR-M,
   respectively. Consequently, the gain to feed ratio was lower (P < 0.05)
   during the pre-weaning period (0.70 versus 0.74 +/- 0.010), and tended
   to be lower during the post-weaning period (0.59 versus 0.66 +/- 0.033)
   in MR-M than in MR-C treatment. Serum haptoglobin concentration was
   similar in both treatments. There were no differences in E. coli fecal
   counts between treatments. Calves in the MR-M treatment had lower
   Cryptosporidium spp. presence in feces during the first wk of study (P
   < 0.05), but there were no differences thereafter. The supplementation
   of MOS in the MR stimulated starter intake after weaning, but this
   supplementation did not show a determining effect on reducing bacteria
   counts or Cryptosporidium spp. presence in calf feces, nor in rate of
   growth. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to assess the incidence of
   incidental vascular and nonvascular findings in patients undergoing
   renal MR angiography and to determine the extent to which these
   findings alter patient management.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. Reports from 380 consecutive renal MR
   angiography examinations performed at a single institution over a
   12-month interval were examined. The presence of incidental vascular
   (i.e., nonrenal artery) and nonvascular findings was noted. Clinical
   records of patients with significant incidental findings were examined
   to determine whether additional imaging, biopsy, or surgery was
   performed.
   RESULTS. Overall, 151 (40%) of 380 patients had one or more additional
   vascular findings not related to the renal arteries, and 221 (58%) of
   380 patients had one or more additional nonvascular findings. Vascular
   findings included mesenteric artery stenosis or occlusion in 33% of
   patients, moderate to severe aortic atherosclerosis in 17%, aortic
   aneurysms in 7%, and aortic dissection in 2%. Incidental malignancies
   were detected in 10 patients (3%), and indeterminate lesions requiring
   follow-up imaging, biopsy, or surgery were noted in 18 patients (5%).
   Overall, management in 5% of patients was significantly altered (i.e.,
   required biopsy, surgery, or other intervention) by incidental findings
   detected on renal MR angiography. Benign lesions not requiring
   additional imaging or follow-up occurred in 54% of patients and
   consisted predominantly of renal cysts.
   CONCLUSION. Incidental findings on renal MR angiography are common.
   Most incidental lesions can be adequately detected and characterized
   with the addition of a few pulse sequences to the standard renal MR
   angiography protocol at a minimal cost in imaging time. The high
   incidence of incidental findings emphasizes the importance of
   performance and interpretation of these examinations by physicians with
   training in abdominal cross-sectional imaging.

AB OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to prospectively compare CT
   angiography (CTA) performed on a 16-MDCT scanner and digital
   subtraction angiography (DSA) in patients with peripheral arterial
   disease.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. CTA and DSA were compared in 50 patients. CTA was
   independently evaluated by two blinded observers. DSA was evaluated by
   two additional blinded observers in consensus. Consensus DSA served as
   the reference standard for comparisons with CTA in terms of diagnostic
   quality, grading of stenoocclusive lesions, visualization of
   collaterals, impact on patient management, and time required for
   analysis.
   RESULTS. No significant differences in diagnostic quality were observed
   between CTA and DSA above the ankle; both CTA observers noted
   significantly better visualization of pedal arteries (70 and 72
   segments, respectively) than on DSA (57 segments). Of 958
   stenoocclusive lesions on DSA, CTA observers 1 and 2 detected 933 and
   929 lesions, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the
   detection of hemodynamically relevant (> 50%) lesions was 93.3% and
   96.5% for observer 1 and 90.1% and 95.6% for observer 2. Collaterals
   were seen at 150 arterial levels on DSA compared with 97 and 92 levels
   on CTA (p < 0.05, both observers). Patient management decisions based
   on CTA were equivalent to those based on DSA in 49 of the 50 patients.
   CONCLUSION. CTA is an effective noninvasive alternative to DSA for the
   evaluation of peripheral arterial disease.

AB First-generation antihistamines can have adverse effects on the central
   nervous system and thereby complicate discharge planning from the
   emergency department (ED). Newer antihistamines are potentially safer,
   causing less sedation with similar efficacy. The aim of this study was
   to review the literature to better define which antihistamines are good
   options for the treatment of acute allergic reactions. A Medline search
   was conducted to identify English language articles published between
   January 1975 and March 2006 on antihistamines, sedation, and acute
   allergic reactions. Bibliographies from included studies were further
   investigated. We focused on sedative potential, effect on cognitive
   function, efficacy, onset of clinical activity, and cost of
   antihistamines. Diphenhydramine impairs psychomotor performance and
   cognitive function. Loratadine and desloratadine are nonsedating but
   less efficacious than cetirizine orfexofenadine. The incidence of
   sedation with cetirizine is less than that of first-generation
   antihistamines but is greater than placebo. Cetirizine has thefastest
   onset of action among the newer antihistamines. Fexofenadine does not
   impair psychomotor or cognitive skills and shows no dose-related
   increase in sedation but has a slower onset of action than
   diphenhydramine and cetirizine. Newer antihistamines cost similar
   to$0.52-2.39 more per dose than diphenhydramine ($0.37). Newer
   antihistamines provide similar efficacy as first-generation
   antihistamines but with less sedation. We believe this benefit
   outweighs the small increase in cost and that newer antihistamines
   should be considered in the management of acute allergic reactions.
   Although comparative ED-based trials are not available, newer
   antihistamines are an option for management of acute allergic reactions
   when sedation is a concern.

AB This research sought to investigate the tolerance level of Zea mays (
   maize) on a crude oil contaminated soil using indices of plant
   performance such as plant height, leaf area and fresh cob yield. In the
   experiments described, conditions of a major spill were simulated by
   pouring different amounts of crude oil on experimental pots containing
   agricultural soil. Maize seeds were then grown amidst adequate
   fertilizer application and irrigation. The results of the study
   revealed that maize can survive soil contamination of about 21% (
   similar to 177 000 mg/kg) and still produce fresh cob yield of about
   60% than on normal soil. There was a stimulated increase in fresh cob
   yield, than that obtained on normal soil at 12.5% soil contamination (
   similar to 112240 mg/kg). Hence, contaminant concentrations of 112 240
   mg/ kg and 177 000 mg/ kg are identified as the 'optimum yield limit'
   and 'lethal threshold' respectively for maize growing on crude oil
   polluted soils. These results highlight the fact that, while concerted
   efforts should be made to remedy petroleum-contaminated agricultural
   soils, certain crops like maize can still produce beneficial yield in
   the presence of good soil management practices.

TI HW-SW emulation framework for temperature-aware design in MPSoCs

AB New tendencies envisage multiprocessor systems-on-chips (MPSoCs) as a
   promising solution for the consumer electronics market. MPSoCs are
   complex to design, as they must execute multiple applications (games,
   video) while meeting additional design constraints (energy consumption,
   time-to-market). Moreover, the rise of temperature in the die for
   MPSoCs can seriously affect their final performance and reliability. In
   this article, we present a new hardware-software emulation framework
   that allows designers a complete exploration of the thermal behavior of
   final MPSoC designs early in the design flow. The proposed framework
   uses FPGA emulation as the key element to model hardware components of
   the considered MPSoC platform at multimegahertz speeds. It
   automatically extracts detailed system statistics that are used as
   input to our software thermal library running in a host computer. This
   library calculates at runtime the temperature of on-chip components,
   based on the collected statistics from the emulated system and final
   floorplan of the MPSoC. This enables fast testing of various thermal
   management techniques. Our results show speedups of three orders of
   magnitude compared to cycle-accurate MPSoC simulators.

TI Uncertainty assessment in watershed-scale water quality modeling and
   management: 2. Management objectives constrained analysis of
   uncertainty (MOCAU)
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION; SENSITIVITY; CALIBRATION; EQUIFINALITY; PREDICTIONS
AB Watershed-scale water quality models are increasingly used to support
   management decision making. However, significant uncertainty in model
   output remains an unaddressed issue. In our first study, a framework
   for assessing the uncertainty in watershed modeling and management was
   developed, and the application of the generalized likelihood
   uncertainty estimation ( GLUE) approach was examined. The influence of
   subjective choices ( especially the likelihood measure) in a GLUE
   analysis, as well as of availability of observational data, was
   investigated. On the basis of GLUE, we developed a new Bayesian
   approach of uncertainty analysis, specifically for management-oriented
   watershed water quality modeling, as introduced in this paper. The
   approach, named management objectives constrained analysis of
   uncertainty (MOCAU), inherits GLUE's equifinality ideology while
   explicitly considering management objectives and observational
   uncertainty. It has many unique features that have not been covered (
   or have not been explored in great detail) by previous GLUE studies. A
   series of experiments was conducted to investigate the performance of
   MOCAU. The results show that MOCAU can be applied efficiently,
   generating accurate uncertainty estimates for management applications.
   Subjective assumptions in the uncertainty analysis are explicit and
   realistic, on the basis of management objectives such as nonattainment
   frequency of water quality objectives. MOCAU also yields insights into
   watershed model structure improvement and strategic data collection to
   reduce uncertainty. Besides water quality modeling, MOCAU can also be
   applied to other complicated modeling problems where errors are
   significant, observational data is limited, and management objectives
   are involved.

AB Multiple criteria analysis (MCA) is a framework for ranking or scoring
   the overall performance of decision options against multiple
   objectives. The approach has widespread and growing application in the
   field of water resource management. This paper reviews 113 published
   water management MCA studies from 34 countries. It finds that MCA is
   being heavily used for water policy evaluation, strategic planning and
   infrastructure selection. A wide range of MCA methods are being used
   with the fuzzy set analysis, paired comparison and outranking methods
   being most common. The paper also examines the motivations for adopting
   MCA in water management problems and considers future research
   directions.

AB As environmental impacts of landfill last from beginning of cell
   filling to many years after, there is an increasing interest in
   monitoring landfill leachate composition especially with regards to
   metals and metalloids. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
   coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has
   been applied to the speciation of arsenic in landfill leachates. The
   difficulty is related to the complexity and heterogeneity of leachate
   matrices. A soft sample preparation protocol with water dilution and
   filtration of leachates has proved to be sufficient for the achievement
   of identification and quantification of arsenic species without matrix
   effect. The cationic-exchange separation method developed has enabled
   the detection of six arsenic species (AsIII, MMA, AsV, DMA, AsB, TMAO)
   in different landfill leachates. The wide range of concentrations of
   arsenic species (from 0.2 to 250 9 mu g As L-1) and their repartition
   illustrate the high variability of these effluents depending on the
   nature of the wastes, the landfill management, the climatic conditions
   and the degradation phase, to list a few. These results provide new
   information about the chemical composition of these effluents which is
   useful to better adapt their treatment and to achieve the risk
   assessment of landfill management. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study assessed the performance and developed a simple approach for
   estimating infiltration capacity of two infiltration gutters by using
   on-site tests. Permeable-brick and redbrick infiltration gutters were
   constructed on-site. Water infiltrated from the surfaces of two
   vertical sides (NFS-2S), bottom (NFS-B), and three faces (NFS-3S) of
   two gutters were measured under nonflowing and steady-state conditions.
   Tests results from NFS-2S and NFS-3S indicate that the permeability and
   water depth for both gutters are linearly dependent on each other.
   Experimental results also indicate that, when the bottom of the gutter
   is clogged, the permeable-brick gutter still retains approximately 93
   and 79% for redbrick gutter of their infiltration capacity for NFS-3S.
   On the whole, penneable-brick gutter has an advantage over redbrick
   gutter in stormwater infiltration. Based on these results, the
   permeability for different water depths and widths of these two gutters
   can be obtained.

AB Objectives Brachytherapy is a widely used treatment for localized
   prostate cancer (CaP) and is only appropriate as monotherapy I-or
   low-risk cancer. The predicted response to therapy is defined by the
   pretreatment parameters, of which the biopsy Gleason grade is central.
   However, the biopsy grade often misrepresents the true pathologic
   grade. We examined the impact of incorrect biopsy grading on
   brachytherapy Outcomes.
   Methods We constructed a decision analytic model to assess the
   theoretical performance of brachytherapy for a theoretical cohort of
   men with Gleason score 6 Cal? who underwent radical prostatectomy. The
   variables regarding biopsy Gleason scores and the correlation with the
   surgical specimen findings were generated from the institutional data.
   The ranges for these variables, biochemical performance of
   brachytherapy, costs, and disease state utilities, were obtained from a
   data review.
   Results For the base case, 67% of biopsy grades correlated with the
   pathologic grade. With this concordance, 8% of failures could be
   attributed, in part, to undergrading. On the basis of the model
   assumptions, as concordance worsened to 50%, the rate of undergraded
   failures increased to 12%. After adjusting for the quality of life
   associated with higher-grade disease and the risk of biochemical
   failure, the aggregate cost of treatment of biopsy grade 6 disease was
   increased by 8% because of undergrading ($75,700 versus $81,500 per
   case). The bulk of this effect was the cost of failure among patients
   with undergraded disease.
   Conclusions Brachytherapy for Gleason score 6 disease is reported to
   have excellent results. Undergrading of prostate biopsies can
   negatively affect clinical outcomes and increase treatment costs.
   Although the risk is low, it should be considered when counseling
   patients with CaP.

AB Objectives In the fetus with a structurally normal heart, two
   conditions - giant chest mass, such as congenital cystic adenomatoid
   malformation (CCAM), and twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) - alter
   ventricular loading conditions and may result in cardiovascular
   compromise. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of
   cardiovascular dysfunction by comparing geometry-independent, Doppler
   flow-derived measures of ventricular performance in fetuses with
   altered loading conditions vs. those in normal fetuses.
   Methods Doppler flow-derived measures of myocardial performance index
   (MPI) as described by Tei, ventricular ejection force as described by
   Isaaz, and combined cardiac output (CCO) were obtained by
   echocardiography in fetuses with a normal cardiovascular system (n =
   76) or CCAM (n = 36) and fetal partners with TTTS (n = 22).
   Results In the CCAM group, systolic performance as evidenced by the
   ejection forces was preserved, right ventricular (RV) MPI was increased
   and CCO diminished, suggesting diastolic dysfunction and poor filling
   secondary to cardiac compression and a tamponade effect. In TTTS,
   recipient twins exhibited greater left ventricular (LV) ejection forces
   and higher CCO than donor twins, and had abnormal RV and LV MPI,
   reflecting increased preload, preserved left systolic performance, but
   diastolic dysfunction. Donor twins bad diminished ejection forces and
   CCO in comparison with normal controls and recipient partners,
   reflecting hypovolemia.
   Conclusions In both CCAM and recipient twins of the TTTS, diastolic
   dysfunction plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of each
   disorder and precedes changes in systolic performance. Measures of
   ventricular performance can help elucidate poorly understood mechanisms
   of cardiovascular compromise in the developing fetus. Copyright (C)

AB The decline in dairy herd fertility internationally has highlighted the
   limited impact of traditional veterinary approaches to herd fertility.
   The role of the veterinarian in fertility management on dairy farms has
   evolved from addressing individual clinical conditions to analyzing
   suboptimal herd metrics. However, this paradigm shift has only
   successfully occurred in some dairy industries and less so in others.
   Needs analyses indicate that the critical constraints to change are
   veterinary practice size, client motivation and data quality and
   availability. In addition, this review identified the inability of
   veterinarians to demonstrate and to market the cost-benefit of their
   fertility management services as important impediments to change. In
   many cases change is not being managed but is imposed by the growth of
   paraprofessionals. Some veterinarians still see their role as an animal
   clinician while others have evolved into leaders of the herd fertility
   management team. The core role of dairy veterinarians remains
   individual animal examinations but this must be supplemented with
   systematic herd fertility investigation and veterinarian-led herd
   fertility management. This new role encompasses leading the change from
   clinical calls only to a planned approach to herd fertility,
   demonstrating the cost-benefits of the program, scheduling fertility
   management consultations, assisting the farmer in setting specific,
   measurable. attainable, relevant and time-limited (SMART) goals,
   drawing up standard operating procedures (SOPs), training and auditing
   staff in fertility management practices, encouraging a team approach,
   implementing veterinary fertility management and monitoring
   performance. Veterinarians who fail to engage in this process of change
   risk being marginalized by others keen to promote their herd fertility
   services. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Improving dairy cow fertility by means of genetic selection is likely
   to become increasingly important, since it is now well established that
   declining fertility cannot only be arrested by improved management.
   Profit margins per kg milk produced are decreasing, therefore farmers
   need to reduce cost and increase herd size. This restricts the labor
   input per cow and the disposable cost of getting a cow pregnant, whilst
   at the same time hormone treatments have become less acceptable. This
   makes it unlikely that additional management interventions will
   maintain fertility at acceptable levels in the near future. Genetic
   improvement seems the obvious solution. Effective selection tools are
   available in most Western countries using traditional breeding value
   estimation procedures. Also, in addition to gene assisted selection
   using individual genes or QTL, high throughput Single Nucleotide
   Polymorphism (SNP) technology allows genetic improvement of fertility
   based on information from the whole genome (tens of thousands SNP per
   animal), i.e. genomic selection. Simulation studies have shown that
   genomic selection improves the accuracy of selecting juvenile animals
   compared with traditional breeding methods and compared with selection
   using information from a few genes or QTL only. Research in the areas
   genomics and proteomics promise to make genetic selection even more
   effective. The genomic and proteomics technologies combined with the
   bioinformatics tools that support the interpretation of gene
   functioning and protein expression facilitate an exciting starting
   point for the development of new management strategies and tools for
   the improvement of reproductive performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Reproductive performance of dairy cattle has been related to a wide
   variety of indicators of energy status, e.g., extent of negative energy
   balance, time of energy balance nadir, body weight loss, body condition
   score, and body condition score loss. Energy balance begins to decrease
   during the last few weeks prior to calving primarily due to a 30-35%
   reduction in feed intake. Cows typically remain in negative energy
   balance for five to seven weeks postpartum. Nutritional strategies to
   improve energy balance during the transition period include fat
   supplementation and feeding additional nonfiber carbohydrate.
   Unfortunately, neither approach is likely to markedly enhance energy
   status, although fat supplementation may increase reproductive
   efficiency independent of any effect on energy balance. Alternative
   management strategies may be required to improve fertility of dairy
   cows. Shortening or eliminating the dry period may improve energy
   status of dairy cows and increase reproductive efficiency. Shortening
   or eliminating the dry period may enhance dry matter intake during the
   transition period, decrease milk energy output, or both. A preliminary
   study using small animal numbers indicated that reducing dry period
   length to 28 or 0 days may decreases days to first ovulation, increase
   first service conception rate, and decrease days open. A follow-up
   study employing large animal numbers confirmed that reducing dry period
   length from 55 to 34 days can decrease days to first ovulation and
   decrease the percentage of anovular cows. The reduction in days open
   was greater for older cows than second parity cows. The reduction in
   days open was not related to effects of treatment on milk yield.
   Shortening or eliminating the dry period may be a more successful
   approach to improving reproductive efficiency than diet manipulation.

AB Lower market prices and environmental concerns now orientate wheat (
   Triticum aestivum L.) breeding programs towards low input agricultural
   practices, and more particularly low nitrogen (N) input management.
   Such programs require knowledge of the genetic determination of plant
   reaction to N deficiency. Our aim was to characterize the genetic basis
   of N use efficiency and genotype x N interactions. The detection of QTL
   for grain yield, grain protein yield and their components was performed
   on a mapping population of 222 doubled haploid lines (DH), obtained
   from the cross between an N stress tolerant variety and an N stress
   sensitive variety. Experiments on the population were carried out in
   seven different environments, and in each case under high (N+) and low
   (N-) N supplies.
   In total, 233 QTL were detected for traits measured in each combination
   of environment and N supply, for "global'' interaction variables (N+-N-
   and N-/N+), for sensitivity to N stress and for performance under
   N-limited conditions which were assessed using factorial regression
   parameters. The 233 QTL were detected on the whole genome and clustered
   into 82 genome regions. The dwarfing gene (Rht-B1), the photoperiod
   sensitivity gene (Ppd-D1) and the awns inhibitor gene (B1) coincided
   with regions that contained the highest numbers of QTL. Non-interactive
   QTL were detected on linkage groups 3D, 4B, 5A1 and 7B2. Interactive
   QTL were revealed by interaction or factorial regression variables
   (2D2, 3D, 5A1, 5D, 6A, 6B, 7B2) or by both variables (1B, 2A1, 2A2,
   2D1, 4B, 5A2, 5B). The usefulness of QTL meta-analysis and factorial
   regression to study QTL x N interactions and the impact of Rht-B1,
   Ppd-D1 and B1, are discussed.

AB In studies about optimization of rotor spinning machine parameters,
   generally classical statistical methods have been used; the priorities
   and preferences of the yarn producer about yarn properties to get the
   desired end product characteristics have not been taken into
   consideration. However, machine part selection from possible
   alternatives with different properties and performance levels about
   yarn quality is a difficult task and inherently a multicriteria
   decision-making problem. In this study, it is proved that application
   of a multicriteria decision aid method, ELECTRE III, can provide
   valuable assistance in reaching acceptable solutions in order to select
   the appropriate navel for Ne 12 rotor yarn spun to weave denim fabric.
   In experimental part of the study, Ne 12 rotor yarns were spun by using
   ten navels having different technical properties and their quality
   parameters were analysed with ELECTRE III.

   and extended field life
SO SPE DRILLING & COMPLETION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper deals with a case study of a high-rate sour-gas field in
   Pakistan. The paradigm shift from sand control to sand management
   boosted production rates by more than 100%. At the same time, higher
   wellhead pressures and less drawdown will extend field life and
   ultimate recovery. Major investments such as wellhead or field
   front-end compression could be delayed and, thereby, appreciable cost
   savings could be generated.
   After initial well test results, it was concluded that all wells in the
   Miano gas field will need gravel-pack installations to protect
   completion and surface equipment. Only after 2 years of production at
   high rates in excess of 50 MMscf/D was it found that the installed
   gravel packs reduce flow rates severely. The paper will demonstrate
   how, through reinterpretation of data that formed the basis for the
   previous decision to gravel pack the wells and a thorough evaluation of
   sand-production potential and risks, a successful sand-management
   strategy was deployed. Existing gravel packs were perforated, and later
   production wells have been completed without gravel packs beforehand.
   Rigorous monitoring of surface equipment by means of erosion probes,
   ultrasonic wall-thickness measurements, and choke-performance charts
   has been introduced to ensure safe production operations.

AB The high operating power density and aggressively scaled geometries
   associated with 400+ GHz InP-Based DHBTs present a new challenge in
   device design and thermal management. In order to assess the effects of
   self-heating on the RF performance, S-parameters of six InP DHBTs with
   varying emitter dimensions were measured over a 75 degrees C ambient
   temperature range. An 8-10% increase in peak f(T) is observed as the
   temperature is reduced. Data analysis indicates that reductions in the
   base and collector transit times and the base-emitter charging times
   are responsible for the peak f(T) improvement. The calculated electron
   velocities exceed 6 x 10(7) cm/s, indicating velocity overshoot plays a
   critical role in the reduction of the transit times. When emitter
   scaling are considered, the total transit time variation is directly
   correlated to the rise injunction temperature. Using previously
   measured thermal resistance values, a 77-116 degrees C minimum junction
   temperature rise is estimated from self-heating. Therefore, the 8-10%
   increase in peak f(T) is a reasonable estimate of the performance to be
   recovered by minimizing self-heating. Improved intra-device thermal
   management through device design is an important supplement to geometry
   scaling as a means to enhance device performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier

AB Simulation models integrate our knowledge of soil organic C (SOC)
   dynamics and are useful tools for evaluating impacts of crop management
   on soil C sequestration; yet, they require local calibration. Our
   objectives were to calibrate the Environmental Policy Integrated
   Climate (EPIC) model, and evaluate its performance for simulating SOC
   fractions as affected by soil landscape and management. An automated
   parameter optimization procedure was used to calibrate the model for a
   site-specific experiment in the Coastal Plain of central Alabama. The
   ability of EPIC to predict corn (Zea mays L.) and cotton (Gossypium
   hirsutum L.) yields and SOC dynamics on different soil landscape
   positions (summit, sideslope, and drainageway) during the initial
   period of conservation tillage adoption (5 yr) was evaluated using
   regression and mean squared deviations. Simulated yield explained 88%
   of measured yield variation, with the greatest disagreement on the
   sideslope position and the greatest agreement in the drainageway.
   Simulations explained approximately 1, 34, and 40% of the total
   variation in microbial biomass C (MBC), particulate organic C (POC),
   and total organic C (TOC), respectively. The lowest errors in TOC
   simulations (0-20 cm) were found on the sideslope and summit. We
   conclude that the automated parameterization was generally successful,
   although further work is needed to refine the MBC and POC fractions,
   and to improve EPIC predictions of SOC dynamics with depth. Overall,
   EPIC was sensitive to spatial differences in C fractions that resulted
   from differing soil landscape positions. The model needs additional
   refinement for accurate simulations of field-scale SOC dynamics
   affected by short-term management decisions.

AB Synthesis of insect and soil variable patterns in space and time via
   process models would be useful for reducing the cost of field
   monitoring and for achieving improved integrated pest management.
   During 2001-2003, we monitored the Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) root
   weevil population in a flatwoods citrus grove containing a sandy
   Alfisol and a loamy Mollisol in Hendry County, South Florida. Our
   objectives were to examine the multi-year correlations of the Diaprepes
   root weevil with soil characteristics, and to develop a time series
   model and soil variable-based simple and multivariate linear models for
   predicting weevil patterns in space and time. Adult weevils were
   monitored weekly using 100 Tedders traps arranged in a 30 x 12 in grid.
   Gravimetric soil water content (SWC), time-domainreflectory (TDR)
   volumetric SWC, soil organic matter content (SOM), clay, sand, silt,
   pH, and Mehlich-1 extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn concentrations
   were determined for each trap location. Adult weevil density was 0.023
   +/- + 0.018 weevils m(-2) across the 3 years, and the weevil population
   grew exponentially (R 2 = 0.81). Each year, the weevil was positively
   related to SWC, TDR, clay, SOM, and soil Mg, Ca and K concentrations
   (0.32<r<0.65, P<0.05). High weevil density, SWC, SOM, and P, K, Mg and
   Ca levels matched the Mollisol boundary. The autocorrelation ranges for
   the weevil and soil variables were within the soil type unit. Time
   series moving average forecast of Diaprepes weevil development was
   related to the 3-year mean weevil density monitored in the field (R2 =
   0.88). The SWC, TDR and SOM-based simple and multivariate linear models
   explained 45% of the variance in the weevil patterns (P<0.001). Time
   series and soil characteri stics- based simple and multivariate linear
   models suggest a variable rate and less frequent spray for future
   management of the weevil in citrus production systems. (c) 2007

AB Practice-based evaluation integrates research skills and techniques
   into the clinical process in order to correlate clinical interventions
   with treatment outcomes. Although most clinicians recognize the
   importance of some form of practice evaluation, barriers including lack
   of time, resources, expertise, and organizational support may deter
   such evaluation efforts. However, there are numerous advantages for
   clinicians and agencies to develop a culture that values and integrates
   practice evaluation into its daily work-life; these include
   opportunities for teamwork, collaboration, mentoring; and innovation.
   This paper defines practice evaluation research, identifies strategies
   for its implementation, and describes a framework for creating a
   "research friendly" culture. It further describes the implementation of
   such an innovative program in both a hospital and a mental health
   agency setting.

AB Impaired simulated driving performance has been demonstrated in
   obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) patients. Although
   continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) generally improves simulated
   driving performance, the effects of oral-appliance (OA) therapy are
   unknown. The aims of this study were to determine to what extent OSAHS
   patients have more difficulty with a monotonous simulated driving test
   when compared with control subjects and to compare the effects of OA
   with CPAP therapy. Simulated driving performance was evaluated in 20
   OSAHS patients and 16 control subjects during a 25-min driving test.
   After randomization, ten patients started OA and CPAP therapy,
   respectively. After 2 to 3 months of treatment, patients repeated the
   driving test. At baseline, the total number of lapses of attention
   during driving was significantly higher in OSAHS patients as compared
   with control subjects. As a result of treatment, the total number of
   lapses of attention was significantly decreased in both the OA and CPAP
   group. When comparing driving performance between the OA and CPAP
   group, no significant differences were noted. OSAHS patients perform
   worse on a simulated driving test when compared with control subjects.
   When evaluating the effects of treatment, adequate OSAHS management
   with either OA or CPAP therapy usually resulted in substantial
   improvements of simulated driving. Conclusions beyond both treatments
   improving simulated driving performance are, however, not justified by
   the data in the present study.

AB Introduction: lack of evidence in most clinical situations regarding
   irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) enhances the importance of an expert's
   opinion, which will guide management and even the concept underlying
   the disease.
   Objective: to delve into the knowledge and degree of agreement on main
   clinical skills for this syndrome among physicians involved in its
   management.
   Material and method: two rounds of a Delphi survey were conducted on
   100 physicians: general practitioners (GPs) and gastroenterologists.
   The questionnaire evaluated agreement among participants in some
   aspects regarding the definition, diagnosis, and treatment of IBS.
   Results: fifty-five percent of participants completed the two-round
   survey. Agreement was achieved regarding the definition of typical
   symptoms and red flags characterizing IBS. Although there was no
   consensus regarding the appropriate management of patients without
   alarm symptoms, the performance of a colonoscopy on any patient
   presenting red flags was suggested. Patients were thought to require a
   wider examination when older than 40. A well defined line of IBS
   treatment was not found, albeit most physicians tended to choose it
   depending on the main complaint.
   Conclusion: interviewed physicians showed adequate theoretical
   knowledge of IBS, but lack of uniformity on diagnosis and treatment
   approach reflects the controversial day-by-day management of this
   syndrome.

AB Background: Improving patients' health- related quality of life (
   HRQoL) is recognized as a fundamental part of asthma management. The
   aims of this study were to evaluate the long- term efficacy ( including
   symptom- free days and exacerbations) and impact on HRQoL of a stable-
   dose regimen of salmeterol/ fluticasone propionate ( SAL/ FP) and an
   adjustable maintenance dosing ( AMD) regimen of formoterol/ budesonide
   ( FOR/ BUD) where treatment is adjusted based on symptoms [ SAM40056].
   Methods: A total of 688 outpatients with asthma receiving regular low-
   dose inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS) plus a long- acting
   beta(2)-agonist, or medium dose ICS alone participated in this
   randomized, double- blind, double- dummy, parallel- group, 1- year
   trial, which was conducted in 91 centers in 15 countries. Patients were
   randomized to receive 1 inhalation of SAL/ FP 50/ 250 mu g BID or 2
   inhalations of FOR/ BUD 6/ 200 mu g BID during Weeks 1 - 4. For Weeks 5
   - 52, patients meeting strict continuation criteria for stable asthma
   at Week 4 received AMD with FOR/ BUD or stable- dose SAL/ FP.
   Results: The percentage of symptom- free days was significantly greater
   ( 58.8% vs 52.1%; p = 0.034) and the annual exacerbation rate was
   significantly lower ( 47%; p = 0.008) with stable- dose SAL/ FP
   compared with FOR/ BUD AMD. A total of 568 patients completed the
   Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire ( AQLQ) at least once during the
   study. The mean change from baseline in AQLQ overall score was
   numerically greater with SAL/ FP than FOR/ BUD at week 28 and week 52,
   but did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.121 at Week 52).
   However, in a post hoc logistic regression analyses for any AQLQ
   improvement, significant benefits with SAL/ FP were seen at both time
   points ( p = 0.038 and p = 0.009, respectively). The minimally
   important difference of >= 0.5- point improvement in AQLQ overall score
   was achieved by a significantly greater number of patients receiving
   SAL/ FP at Week 28 ( 68% vs 60%; p = 0.049); a trend for this
   difference remained at Week 52 ( 71% vs 65%) ( p = 0.205).
   Conclusion: In this population of patients with persistent asthma,
   stable- dose SAL/ FP resulted in significantly greater increases in
   symptom- free days, a reduction in exacerbation rates, and provided
   greater HRQoL benefits compared with FOR/ BUD AMD.

AB This study examined the effects of teaching employees with moderate
   intellectual disabilities to use sight-word checklists as antecedent
   prompts to self-initiate job tasks in varied and novel sequences. The
   intervention package consisted of (a) sight word reading and
   comprehension instruction, and (b) self-management training using first
   a consistently ordered sight-word checklist and then varied checklists
   in which the word order representing job sequences varied across
   sessions. A multiple probe design across participants was used to
   evaluate (a) the effects of sight word instruction and self-management
   training on the participants' self-initiations of job tasks, and b) the
   effects of a consistently ordered (i.e., single exemplar) versus varied
   (i.e., multiple exemplars) checklists on the participants' performance
   across novel job sequences. Results indicated that the training package
   was effective in teaching the employees to use sight-word checklists to
   initiate job tasks, but only when the employees were trained on varied
   checklists were they able to initiate job tasks across novel varied job
   sequences. The advantages of instructing across varied sight-word
   checklists for promoting independence in changing work environments are
   discussed.

AB The determination of antiretroviral drug concentrations in patients
   treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is an
   essential part of optimum patient management because of the multitude
   of pharmacokinetic drug interactions between these drugs and the risk
   of treatment failure or viral resistance if therapeutic concentrations
   are not reached. Currently, 21 different antiretrovirals are used in
   various combinations rendering therapeutic drug monitoring a laborious
   task. We therefore aimed to simultaneously determine as many
   antiretrovirals as possible using triple quadrupole mass spectroscopy
   with electrospray ionisation. For this purpose, spectra and
   fragmentation patterns of the protease inhibitors amprenavir,
   atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and
   saquinavir, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
   delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine, the nucleoside reverse
   transcription inhibitors abacavir, didanosine, erntricitabine,
   lamivudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, and zidovudine, and the nucleotide
   reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir were evaluated. A
   bioanalytical method to determine all protease and non-nucleoside
   reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and zalcitabine and zidovudine
   concentrations in biological matrices was developed. Samples were
   prepared by protein precipitation with methanol after addition of three
   different internal standards. Antiretrovirals were separated by
   high-performance liquid chromatography on a Nucleosil C18-100 Nautilus
   column using a gradient of 20mM ammonium acetate including 0.1% aqueous
   acetic acid and acetonitrile and detected by electrospray ionisation/
   tandem mass spectrometry in the negative (efavirenz, stavudine,
   zidovudine) or positive ionisation mode (all other compounds). The
   bioanalytical method was successfully validated according to FDA
   guidelines and applied to plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples of
   patients treated for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

DE clinical waste; health and safety; hospital hygiene; waste management
AB Methods: The arrangements for bulk clinical waste handling were audited
   in 16 UK hospitals, one year after an earlier audit that revealed many
   deficiencies in performance.
   Results: Storage of clinical waste carts in areas accessible to members
   of the public and failure to lock individual waste carts was common.
   Waste segregation was poor. Many clinical waste carts and the areas
   dedicated to their storage were in a poor state of repair. Many
   instances of clinical waste storage apparently in breach of UK health
   and safety legislation, of fire regulations, and of the hazardous waste
   regulations were observed.
   Conclusions: The standard of performance in clinical waste management
   in UK hospitals remains poor, with evidence of neglect of basic
   hygiene, housekeeping and safety standards. However, codes of practice
   exist, and despite implementation of the Hazardous Waste Regulations
   2006 that provide further control on all wastes management issues, the
   reality of clinical waste management in some National Health Service
   (NHS) hospitals continues to be largely inadequate. (C) 2007 The Royal

AB Bipolar disorder is a pathological disturbance of mood, characterized
   by waxing and waning manic, depressive and, sometimes distinctly mixed
   states. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder can only be made with certainty
   when the manic syndrome declares itself. Most individuals who are
   diagnosed with this disorder will experience both poles of the illness
   recurrently, but depressive episodes are the commonest cause of
   morbidity and, indeed, of death by suicide.
   Twin, adoption and epidemiological studies suggest a strongly genetic
   aetiology. It is a genetically and phenotypically complex disorder.
   Thus, the genes contributing are likely to be numerous and of small
   effect. Individuals with bipolar disorder also display deficits on a
   range of neuropsychological tasks in both the acute and euthymic phases
   of illness and correlations between number of affective episodes
   experienced and task performance are commonly reported. Current
   self-report and observer-rated scales are optimized for unipolar
   depression and hence limited in their ability to accurately assess
   bipolar depression. The development of a specific depression rating
   scale will improve the assessment of bipolar depression in both
   research and clinical settings. It will improve the development of
   better treatments and interventions.
   Guidelines support the use of antidepressants for bipolar depression.
   With regard to the adverse effects of antidepressants for bipolar
   depression, double-blind, placebo-controlled data suggest that
   antidepressant monotherapy or the addition of a tricyclic
   antidepressant may worsen the course of bipolar disorder. Importantly,
   adjunctive psychotherapies add significantly (both statistically and
   clinically) to the efficacy of pharmacological treatment regimens. The
   successful management of bipolar disorder clearly demands improved
   recognition of bipolar disorder and effective long-term treatment for
   bipolar depression as well as mania. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

DE PSM; process safety management; management system; safety culture;
   leadership; risk-based
AB The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Center for
   Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) has developed a guideline describing a
   new risk based approach that an organization can use in defining and
   implementing a process safety management system specific to its unique
   needs. Recognizing the importance of safety culture as a determinant of
   safety performance, CCPS has included process safety culture as one
   element in the new risk-based process safety (RBPS) model. This paper
   will describe both the new process safety culture element and its
   integration in the overall ABPS model.

   ADULT LEARNER; RISK-TAKING; INSTRUCTION; PARTICIPATION; EXPERIENCE;

AB The UK chief medical officer's recommendations for the re-licensing and
   performance management of doctors will mean a move from a formative
   towards a summative role for appraisal and its adjunct, the personal
   development plan. Where does this leave medical educators trying to
   promote reflective learning? It is taken for granted that self-directed
   learning is the sine qua non of all adult learning. But is it? This
   review re-evaluates self-directed learning and its corollary, the
   personal development plan, in the light of the chief medical officer's
   report, seeking the evidence behind today's accepted educational
   practice. It discovers a reality which challenges assumptions long
   enshrined in medical education.

ID ESTABLISHMENT
AB Two field experiments were carried out to analyze the performance of
   white clover varieties differing in their resistance to stem nematode.
   Varieties were compared under grazing and cutting regimes in mixed
   swards with or without the addition of nematode and dry matter yields
   of white clover and perennial ryegrass recorded over a 3-year period.
   The resistant variety did not show a yield advantage in the absence of
   nematode but did so in the presence of nematode in the first year and
   for several of the sampling dates in the second year. White clover
   yields under grazing were significantly less than under cutting in both
   experiments. The hypothesis that the additional stress of grazing would
   increase the benefits of resistance relative to a cutting management
   was not supported.

SO ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
DE academic management; change; critical management; rationality;

ID PERFORMANCE-APPRAISAL; ORGANIZATIONS; RATIONALITIES; MCUNIVERSITY;
   DISCOURSE; EDUCATION
AB The seemingly marginal contribution of management theory to management
   practice has been commented on in different contexts. Specifically,
   critical management studies (CMS) seems suspended in an impasse between
   the aim to critique dominant management practice and discourse, and the
   expectation to facilitate transformative management action. This paper
   argues that the theory-practice impasse may, in part, be a result of
   reductivist perspectives discursively produced by both mainstream and
   critical management studies. To illustrate this argument, the paper
   refers to a case study exploring middle management practice in the
   higher education context. It demonstrates that academic middle
   management practice as constructed by polarized and polarizing
   discourses of either managerial or critical orientation is
   counterproductive to a full understanding of this practice and the
   contribution it can make to organizations if properly understood, and
   proposes an alternative reading aimed to 'cross the divide' between
   discourses and between theory and practice. It is proposed that a more
   constructive engagement with multiple rationalities can move towards a
   more comprehensive understanding of currently marginalized management
   activity, and, from there, towards a more productive link between
   theory and practice.

TI Main safety issues at the transition from ITER to fusion power plants
SO NUCLEAR FUSION
LA English
DT Article
AB In parallel to the ITER design process and in close cooperation with
   the designers a fusion specific safety approach was developed and
   implemented. Detailed safety assessments have been performed and
   documented in the ITER Generic Site Safety Report (GSSR). Following the
   decision on ITER construction in France, results from the GSSR and from
   ongoing safety related activities tailored to the Cadarache site and
   the French licensing process are now being used to write the ITER
   Preliminary Safety Analysis Report.
   In the most recent European fusion power plant conceptual. study the
   inherent fusion favourable features have been exploited, by appropriate
   design and choice of materials, to provide major safety and
   environmental advantages. The study focused on five power plant models,
   which are illustrative of a wider spectrum of possibilities. These span
   a range from relatively near-term concepts, based on limited technology
   and plasma physics extrapolations, to a more advanced conception. All
   five PPCS plant models differ substantially in their plasma physics,
   blanket and divertor technology, size, fusion power and materials
   compositions, and these differences lead to differences in the economic
   performance and in the details of safety and environmental impacts.
   The paper uses the quite detailed information available from ITER
   safety documents and highlights the differences between ITER and future
   fusion power plants. The main areas investigated are releases and doses
   during normal operation and under accidental conditions, occupational
   radiation exposure and optimization and waste management, including
   recycling and/or final disposal in repositories.

AB This paper summarises findings from the Pathogen Transmission Routes
   Research Program, describing pathogen pathways from farm animals to
   water bodies and measures that can reduce or prevent this transfer.
   Significant faecal contamination arises through the deposition of
   faeces by grazing animals directly into waterways in New Zealand.
   Bridging of streams intersected by farm raceways is an appropriate
   mitigation measure to prevent direct deposition during herd crossings,
   whilst fencing stream banks will prevent access from pasture into
   waterways by cattle that are characteristically attracted to water.
   Riparian buffer strips not only prevent cattle access to waterways,
   they also entrap microbes from cattle and other animals being washed
   down-slope towards the stream in surface runoff. Microbial water
   quality improvements can be realised by fencing stock from ephemeral
   streams, wetlands, seeps, and riparian paddocks that are prone to
   saturation. Soil type is a key factor in the transfer of faecal
   microbes to waterways. The avoidance of, or a reduction in, grazing and
   irrigation upon poorly drained soils characterised by high bypass flow
   and/or the generation of surface runoff, are expected to improve
   microbial water quality. Dairyshed wastewater should be irrigated onto
   land only when the water storage capacity of the soil will not be
   exceeded. This "deferred irrigation" can markedly reduce pollutant
   transfer to waterways, particularly that via subsurface drains and
   groundwater. Advanced pond systems provide excellent effluent quality
   and have particular application where soil type and/or climate are
   unfavourable for irrigation. Research needs are indicated to reduce
   faecal contamination of waters by livestock.

AB Background A 65-year-old white female who presented with flatulence and
   weight loss was investigated by celiac antibody testing,
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy, duodenal biopsy and colonoscopy. There were
   no positive findings, except for diverticulosis. Almost 5 years later
   repeat investigations performed in response to the patient's anemia
   confirmed the development of celiac disease. After 18 months of symptom
   improvement as a result of gluten exclusion the patient developed
   diarrhea, and colonoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis.
   Investigations Physical examination; analysis of full blood count;
   measurement of serum ferritin, vitamin B-12,folate and C-reactive
   protein levels; thyroid and autoantibody profiling (including analysis
   of endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies); CT scanning of
   the chest, abdomen and pelvis; and performance of
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy, push enteroscopy, colonoscopy and wireless
   capsule endoscopy.
   Diagnosis Celiac disease and ulcerative colitis.
   Management Gluten-free diet, mesalazine and prednisolone.

   Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 39, No. 8, pp. 1435-1445, 2007. Objective: To
   issue a recommendation on the types and amounts of physical activity
   needed to improve and maintain health in older adults. Participants: A
   panel of scientists with expertise in public health, behavioral
   science, epidemiology, exercise science, medicine, and gerontology.
   Evidence: The expert panel reviewed existing consensus statements and
   relevant evidence from primary research articles and reviews of the
   literature. Process: After drafting a recommendation for the older
   adult population and reviewing drafts of the Updated Recommendation
   from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American
   Heart Association (AHA) for Adults, the panel issued a final
   recommendation on physical activity for older adults. Summary: The
   recommendation for older adults is similar to the updated ACSM/AHA
   recommendation for adults, but has several important differences
   including: the recommended intensity of aerobic activity takes into
   account the older adult's aerobic fitness; activities that maintain or
   increase flexibility are recommended; and balance exercises are
   recommended for older adults at risk of falls. In addition, older
   adults should have an activity plan for achieving recommended physical
   activity that integrates preventive and therapeutic recommendations.
   The promotion of physical activity in older adults should emphasize
   moderate-intensity aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity,
   reducing sedentary behavior, and risk management.

TI Complexity, risk and simulation in learning procedural skills
SO MEDICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article

   assessment; safety management; curriculum; learning
ID CRISIS RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; OPERATING-ROOM; SAFETY; PERFORMANCE; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND A complex chain of events underpins every clinical
   intervention, especially those involving invasive procedures. Safety
   requires high levels of awareness and vigilance. In this paper we
   propose a structured approach to procedural training, mapping each
   learner's evolving experience within a matrix of clinical risk and
   procedural complexity. We use a traffic light analogy to conceptualise
   a dynamic awareness of prevailing risk and the implications of moving
   between zones.
   THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTEXT We argue that clinical exposure can be
   consolidated by simulation where appropriate, ensuring that each
   learner gains the skills for safe care within the increasingly limited
   time available for training. To be effective, however, such simulation
   must be realistic, patient-focused, structured and grounded in an
   authentic clinical context. Challenge comes not only from technical
   difficulty but also from the need for interpersonal skills and
   professionalism within clinical encounters.
   PATIENT FOCUSED SIMULATION Many existing simulations focus on crises,
   so clinicians are in a heightened state of expectation that may not
   reflect their usual practice. We argue that simulation should also
   reflect commonly occurring non-crisis situations, allowing clinicians
   to develop an awareness of the complex events that underpin clinical
   encounters. We describe a patient-focused approach to simulation, using
   simulated patients and inanimate models within realistic scenarios, to
   ground experience in authentic clinical practice and bring together the
   complex elements that underpin clinical events.
   APPLICATIONS Although our argument has evolved from surgical practice
   and operating theatre teams, we believe it can be widely applied to the
   increasing number of health care professionals who perform clinical
   interventions.

TI Suboptimal RED feedback control for buffered TCP flow dynamics in
   computer network
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB We present an improved dynamic system that simulates the behavior of
   TCP flows and active queue management (AQM) system. This system can be
   modeled by a set of stochastic differential equations driven by a
   doubly stochastic point process with intensities being the controls.
   The feedback laws proposed monitor the status of buffers and
   multiplexor of the router, detect incipient congestion by sending
   warning signals to the sources. The simulation results show that the
   optimal feedback control law from the class of linear as well as
   quadratic polynomials can improve the system performance significantly
   in terms of maximizing the link utilization, minimizing congestion,
   packet losses, as well as global synchronization. The optimization
   process used is based on random recursive search technique known as RRS.

TI Understanding and improving access to prompt and effective malaria
   treatment and care in rural Tanzania: the ACCESS Programme
SO MALARIA JOURNAL

DT Article

   MANAGEMENT; CHILDHOOD ILLNESS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; FEBRILE ILLNESS;
   DISTRICT; KENYA; AREA
AB Background: Prompt access to effective treatment is central in the
   fight against malaria. However, a variety of interlinked factors at
   household and health system level influence access to timely and
   appropriate treatment and care. Furthermore, access may be influenced
   by global and national health policies. As a consequence, many malaria
   episodes in highly endemic countries are not treated appropriately.
   Project: The ACCESS Programme aims at understanding and improving
   access to prompt and effective malaria treatment and care in a rural
   Tanzanian setting. The programme's strategy is based on a set of
   integrated interventions, including social marketing for improved care
   seeking at community level as well as strengthening of quality of care
   at health facilities. This is complemented by a project that aims to
   improve the performance of drug stores. The interventions are
   accompanied by a comprehensive set of monitoring and evaluation
   activities measuring the programme's performance and (health) impact.
   Baseline data demonstrated heterogeneity in the availability of malaria
   treatment, unavailability of medicines and treatment providers in
   certain areas as well as quality problems with regard to drugs and
   services.
   Conclusion: The ACCESS Programme is a combination of multiple
   complementary interventions with a strong evaluation component. With
   this approach, ACCESS aims to contribute to the development of a more
   comprehensive access framework and to inform and support public health
   professionals and policy-makers in the delivery of improved health
   services.

TI Service-oriented architecture is a driver for daily decision support
SO KYBERNETES
LA English
DT Article
DE business improvement; cybernetics; management theory
AB Purpose - This paper aims to explain why service-oriented business
   intelligence (SOBI) happened, the new development and how to make a
   strategy to introduce daily decision support in the retail trade.
   Design/methodology/approach - The diffusion of business intelligence
   (131) tools is operationalized on Rogers' innovation theory.
   Findings - The article answered the question: How to draft a BI
   strategy for all parts of the retail enterprise? By excellent data
   warehouse quality; choosing an area for common decision support;
   starting simply, with metrics (sale, gross margin, number of customers)
   to get users started and then continue the iterative process of
   practicing more comparing and personalized BI.
   Practical implications - Retailers meet a changeable world around where
   business decisions must be taken daily. In the retail industry, the
   customer's current demands control the supply of commodities,
   inventories and crew. Retailers have enterprise applications designed
   for their business processes, but also daily want to measure the
   performance. It is a question of from existing enterprise applications
   and databases design new decision processes and business flows that
   currently request BI data to be presented directly to operative
   responsible staff.
   Originality/value - Explains why there are attempts to combine the two
   broad architectural paradigms BI and service orientation.
   Service-oriented architecture, Bl, on line analytical processing,
   extract, transform and load, SOBI are discussed in detail.

   CATHARTIC PREPARATION; COLORECTAL NEOPLASIA; ASYMPTOMATIC ADULTS;

AB There are many factors affecting the successful performance of CT
   colonography (CTC). Adequate colonic cleansing and distention, the
   optimal CT technique and interpretation with using the newest CTC
   software by a trained reader will help ensure high accuracy for lesion
   detection. Fecal and fluid tagging may improve the diagnostic accuracy
   and allow for reduced bowel preparation. Automated carbon dioxide
   insufflation is more efficient and may be safer for colonic distention
   as compared to manual room air insufflation. CT scanning should use
   thin collimation of <= 3 mm with a reconstruction interval of <= 1.5 mm
   and a low radiation dose. There is not any one correct method for the
   interpretation of CTC; therefore, readers should be well-versed with
   both the primary 3D and 2D reviews. Polyps detected at CTC should be
   measured accurately and reported following the "polyp size-based"
   patient management system. The time-intensive nature of CTC and the
   limited resources for training radiologists appear to be the major
   barriers for implementing CTC in Korea.

TI Resilient modulus prediction models based on analysis of LTPP data for
   subgrade soils and experimental verification
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Resilient modulus (M-R) value of a subgrade soil is the primary
   property needed for pavement design and analysis. It is the elastic
   modulus based on the recoverable strain under repeated loads, and
   depends on several factors including soil properties, soil type, and
   state of stresses. This paper presents prediction equations developed
   using regression analysis for six AASHTO soil types (A-1 -b, A-3,
   A-2-4, A-4, A-6, and A-7-6) for estimating MR. Data extracted from the
   Long-Term Pavement Performance Information Management System (LTPP IMS)
   database for 258 test specimens (approximately 3,870 MR values)
   collected in 19 states in New England and the nearby regions in the
   United States and two provinces in Canada were used in this study. A
   generalized constitutive model that captures the effect of both bulk
   stress and octahedral shear stress was used to predict the MR of
   subgrade soils by developing regression equations that relate the k
   coefficients to the soil physical properties. The prediction models
   developed were verified for four types of soils collected in the New
   England region by independent laboratory MR tests. It was observed that
   MR values from the prediction models compared well with the laboratory
   values for the majority of the soil types.

ID INFORMATION; RISK; AIDS; MS; PREFERENCES; DEPRESSION; ENCOUNTER; MODEL;
   CARE
AB Patients and health authorities increasingly claim active roles in
   health care decision making processes. As immune therapies in MS are
   partially effective MS is a prototypic condition for a shared decision
   making process. The treatment of acute relapses and the initiation,
   change or withdrawal of so called disease-modifying treatments are key
   decisions in MS management. We developed two decision aids following
   the phased approach of the framework of increasing evidence for complex
   interventions for these key decisions. In prestudies we found that 80%
   of MS patients demand autonomous roles in treatment decisions which
   contrasts with a poor knowledge of risks. On the other hand MS patients
   are not disturbed by evidence-based, balanced complex information. MS
   patients do understand this kind of information and are able to
   transfer new abilities to other situations. Currently we study the
   effects of a 4-hour education programme on relapse management versus an
   information leaflet in controls in 150 MS patients. In a second trial
   with n=298 MS patients we study the effects of an evidence-based
   patient information on immunotherapy on decisional role preference and
   performance in the patient physician encounter. Results in early 2007
   will show to which extent patient education with a focus on
   evidence-based patient information influences participation in the
   decision making process. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   IMPLEMENTATION; SYSTEMS; ERRORS; PERFORMANCE; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT;
   BARRIERS
AB Objective: This study sought to explore physician organizations'
   adoption of chronic care guidelines in order entry systems and to
   investigate the organizational and market-related factors associated
   with this adoption.
   Design: A quantitative nationwide survey of all primary care medical
   groups in the United States with 20 or more physicians; data were
   collected on 1,104 physician organizations, representing a 70% response
   rate.
   Measurements: Measurements were the presence of an asthma, diabetes, or
   congestive heart failure guideline in a physician organization's order
   entry system; size; age of the organization; number of clinic
   locations; type of ownership; health maintenance organization market
   penetration; urban/rural location; and presence of external incentives
   to improve quality of care.
   Results: Only 27% of organizations reported access to order entry with
   decision support for chronic disease care. External incentives for
   quality is the only factor significantly associated with adoption of
   these tools. Organizations experiencing greater external incentives for
   quality are more likely to adopt order entry with decision support.
   Conclusion: Because external incentives are strong drivers of adoption,
   policies requiring reporting of chronic care measurements and rewarding
   improvement as well as financial incentives for use of specific
   information technology tools are likely to accelerate adoption of order

ID SYSTEMS
AB Multiprocessor system-on-chip (MP-SoC) platforms represent an emerging
   trend for embedded multimedia applications. To enable MP-SoC platforms,
   scalable communication-centric interconnect fabrics, such as
   networks-on-chip (NoCs), have been recently proposed. The shared memory
   represents one of the key elements in designing MP-SoCs to provide data
   exchange and synchronization support.
   This paper focuses on the energy/delay exploration of a distributed
   shared memory architecture, suitable for low-power on-chip
   multiprocessors based on NoC. A mechanism is proposed for the data
   allocation on the distributed shared memory space, dynamically managed
   by an on-chip hardware memory management unit (HwMMU). Moreover, the
   exploitation of the HwMMU primitives for the migration, replication,
   and compaction of shared data is discussed. Experimental results show
   the impact of different distributed shared memory configurations for a
   selected set of parallel benchmark applications from the
   power/-performance perspective. Furthermore, a case study for a graph
   exploration algorithm is discussed, accounting for the effects of the
   core mapping and the network topology on energy and performance at the
   system level. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Heterogeneous parallel and distributed computing systems may operate in
   an environment where certain system performance features degrade due to
   unpredictable circumstances. Robustness can be defined as the degree to
   which a system can function correctly in the presence of parameter
   values different from those assumed. This work develops a model for
   quantifying robustness in a dynamic heterogeneous computing environment
   where task execution time estimates are known to contain errors. This
   mathematical expression of robustness is then applied to two different
   problem environments. Several heuristic solutions to both problem
   variations are presented that utilize this expression of robustness to
   influence mapping decisions.

SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING

ID PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS
AB Meeting the future computing needs of the scientific community will
   likely require the development of petascale computing environments
   based on the integration of significant numbers of processors into
   large-scale clusters, and the (possibly heterogeneous) aggregation of
   multiple clusters for use by individual and/or synchronized
   applications. Despite the best of efforts, such complex systems dictate
   that applications must expect to encounter failures of their computing
   resources and/or networks during the course of execution.
   The Open Run-Time Environment (OpenRTE) has been designed to support
   high-performance computing applications in such environments. Gaining
   acceptance by the user community requires that OpenRTE not only meet
   basic functional requirements, but must also provide users with (a) a
   transparent interface that avoids the need to customize applications
   when moving between specific computing and/or communication resources;
   (b) effective strategies that can be selected at run-time for dealing
   with faults; (c) transparent support for inter-process communication,
   resource discovery and allocation, and process launch across a variety
   of platforms; and (d) the ability to launch their applications remotely
   from their desktop, disconnect from them, and reconnect at a later time
   to monitor progress.
   This paper provides an updated description of OpenRTE and discusses its
   relation to the current grid protocols. In addition, we introduce the
   concept of resilient computing-a next-generation approach to fault
   tolerance-and describe how OpenRTE will utilize this concept in the
   future.

TI Unibus: a contrarian approach to grid computing
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE resource sharing; virtualization; aggregation; grids; MPI
AB Despite maturing in many ways, heterogeneous distributed computing
   platforms continue to require substantial effort in terms of software
   installation and management for efficient use, often necessitating
   manual intervention by resource providers and end-users. In this paper
   we propose a novel model of resource sharing that is a viable
   alternative to that commonly adopted in the grid community. Our model,
   termed Unibus, shifts the resource virtualization and aggregation
   responsibilities to the software at the client side, taking these
   burdens away from resource providers. Drawing from parallels with
   operating systems, we argue that distributed resources may be unified
   and aggregated at the user's end, in a manner similar to ordinary
   peripheral devices. Running on the user's access device, the overlay
   system software can virtualize remote resources via dynamically
   deployed software mediators analogous to device drivers, reconfiguring
   the resources if necessary via "firmware" modules. To illustrate the
   feasibility of the Unibus model, we have prototyped a development
   toolkit automating the installation, build, run, and post-processing
   stages of MPI applications. Through the provided console, this toolkit
   can deploy and configure an MPI execution environment across a set of
   heterogeneous, isolated distributed resources, turning them into a
   coherent virtual machine with a single interface point. We conducted a
   series of experiments with the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Results
   indicate that the toolkit preserves the application performance of
   "bare" MPI, while substantially reducing maintenance and configuration
   efforts. Overall, the results suggest that the envisioned client side
   overlay model for resource sharing may potentially be able to address
   some of long-standing obstacles in building heterogeneous HPC systems.

AB Background/Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess the impact
   of a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) on children with spinal cord
   injuries (SCI) in terms of functional independence and time
   requirements for performance of functional activities and to ascertain
   the children's preference for TLSO use.
   Methods: Fourteen subjects with thoracic SCI, ages 6 to 14 years, were
   studied. All subjects had previously been prescribed and were using a
   TLSO to prevent the progression of scoliosis. Functional activities
   included in the Functional Independence Measure and 6 additional
   wheelchair and transfer skills were scored by level of assistance
   required. The timed motor test (TMT) included 6 activities involving
   dressing, transfers, and wheelchair propulsion. Subjects completed the
   activities of the functional activities scale (FAS) and TMT while
   wearing a TLSO and without a TLSO. Subjects were asked their preference
   for wearing or not wearing the TLSO during each of the activities.
   Results: For the TMT, subjects were slower with a TLSO when donning a
   shirt or pants, with even and uneven transfers and hallway propulsion
   (P < 0.05). The majority of subjects preferred not wearing the TLSO
   during the TMT activities. Lower functional activity scores were
   recorded while wearing a TLSO for upper-extremity dressing (P < 0.05),
   lower-extremity dressing, bladder management, transferring to bed, and
   reaching for objects on the floor. Subjects preferred not wearing a
   TLSO for the following activities: lower-extremity dressing, bladder
   management, reaching for an object on the floor, and transfer from a
   supine to a sitting position.
   Conclusions: Wearing a TLSO adversely affected independence level and
   time requirements for selected functional activities. Subjects
   preferred not wearing a TLSO while performing the activities.
   Activities that required hip flexion, such as donning pants or
   transitioning from a supine to a sitting position were restricted by
   the TLSO. Future studies with larger sample sizes should explore the
   relationships between functioning with a TLSO as related to a patient's
   age, level of injury, and TLSO design.

TI The perceived compatibility of safety and production expectations in
   hazardous occupations

AB Introduction: Safety hazards are unavoidable in many work environments.
   Employees must be both productive and safe, however, conflicting safety
   and production demands can negatively affect safety, production, or
   both. The employee's perception of the compatibility of management's
   safety and production expectations is a possible predictor of such
   consequences. This paper defines "safety-production compatibility" and
   describes how measures of safety-production compatibility, as well as
   safety pressure and production pressure, were developed. Method: We
   used LISREL structural equation modeling to test the influences of
   safety-production compatibility, safety pressure, and production
   pressure on safe work behavior and interference with performing other
   work tasks. The 239 study participants were workers employed in diverse
   but hazardous occupations. Results: Pressure to work safely was
   positively associated with safe work behavior. The perceived
   compatibility of safety and production demands positively influenced
   safe work behavior and reduced the interference of safety hazards
   performing other tasks. Safety-production compatibility was also found
   to mediate the relationship between trust in management and safe work
   behavior. Conclusions: The results of this field study suggest
   increased compatibility, and thus less conflict, between safety and
   production demands influences safe work behavior and the interference
   of safety hazards with performing other work tasks. More broadly, the
   worker's reaction to multiple work demands is a safety and performance
   influence. Impact on Industry: Safety management efforts that focus
   only on the hazards fail to eliminate many accidents because accidents
   arise from many factors including technology, safety climate, social
   influences, production, and safety demands. This study suggests that
   workers differ in their perception of the compatibility of safety and
   production demands. These differences will show up in safe work
   behavior, influencing the effectiveness of safety management efforts
   and the trust workers have in management's concern for safety. (c) 2007

AB To study the effects of acetylchohnesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) in the
   management of cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia, we
   investigated the effects of 12 weeks of adjunctive therapy with
   donepezil on their cognitive impairments.
   Twenty-four subjects stabilized on hatoperichot treatment (5-30mg/day)
   for a minimum of 3 months were entered into a doubleblind,
   placebo-controlled trial of donepezil as an adjunctive treatment.
   Subjects were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to
   receive either 5 mg/day donepezil (N = 12) or placebo (N= 12) for 12
   weeks. The subjects were evaluated at baseline, and after 4, 8, and 12
   weeks using the Korean version of Mini Mental State Examination
   (K-MMSE), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and standard
   neuropsychological assessment.
   The K-MMSE scores improved significantly (p < 0.05) but the BPRS scores
   did not improve significantly in patients given chonepezil; subjects
   showed slight improvement in several cognitive measures. At the end of
   the study, the difference in the mean K-MMSE scores between the
   donepezit and placebo groups approached statistical significance (p =
   0.056). Of the several domains of cognitive functions assessed, verbal
   recognition and visual recall memory improved significantly (p <0.05).
   But donepezil did not affect scores in the executive function tests.
   Our findings support a potential positive effect of AChEIs in the
   management of cognitive impairments in patients with chronic
   schizophrenia. Further studies with large subjects are needed to
   confirm our findings.

TI Heat-driven liquid metal cooling device for the thermal management of a
   computer chip
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID THERMOELECTRIC GENERATORS; MICRODEVICES; PERFORMANCE; POWER
AB The tremendous heat generated in a computer chip or very large scale
   integrated circuit raises many challenging issues to be solved.
   Recently, liquid metal with a low melting point was established as the
   most conductive coolant for efficiently cooling the computer chip.
   Here, by making full use of the double merits of the liquid metal, i.e.
   superior heat transfer performance and electromagnetically drivable
   ability, we demonstrate for the first time the liquid-cooling concept
   for the thermal management of a computer chip using waste heat to power
   the thermoelectric generator (TEG) and thus the flow of the liquid
   metal. Such a device consumes no external net energy, which warrants it
   a self-supporting and completely silent liquid-cooling module.
   Experiments on devices driven by one or two stage TEGs indicate that a
   dramatic temperature drop on the simulating chip has been realized
   without the aid of any fans. The higher the heat load, the larger will
   be the temperature decrease caused by the cooling device. Further, the
   two TEGs will generate a larger current if a copper plate is sandwiched
   between them to enhance heat dissipation there. This new method is
   expected to be significant in future thermal management of a desk or
   notebook computer, where both efficient cooling and extremely low
   energy consumption are of major concern.

AB Pain assessment in older persons with severe cognitive impairment (SCI)
   is a challenge due to reduced self-report capacity and lack of
   movement-related pain assessment instruments. The purpose of this
   article was to describe the development of the
   Mobilization-Observation-Behaviour-Intensity-Dementia Pain Scale
   (MOBID) and, to investigate aspects of reliability and validity. MOBID
   is a nurse-administered instrument developed for use in patients with
   SCI, where presence of pain behavior indicators (pain noises, facial
   expression, and defense) may be observed during standardized active,
   guided movements, and then inferred to represent pain intensity.
   Initially, the MOBID contained seven items (observing at rest,
   mobilization of the hands, arms, legs, turn over in bed, sitting on
   bedside, and teeth/mouth care). This was tested in 26 nursing home
   patients with SCI. Their primary caregivers, five registered nurses and
   six licensed practical nurses (LPNs), rated the patients' pain
   intensity during regular morning care, and by MOBID, both at bedside
   and from video uptakes. Three external raters (LPNs), not knowing the
   patients, also completed the MOBID by rating the videos. Internal
   consistency of the MOBID indicated high Cronbach's alpha (alpha = 0.90)
   after deleting the items for observation, at rest and observation of
   teeth/mouth care. MOBID disclosed significantly more pain than did pain
   scorings during regular morning care, and video observation
   demonstrated higher pain intensity than bedside scoring. Intertester
   reliability for inferred pain intensity was high to excellent
   (intraclass correlation coefficient= 0.70-0.96), but varied between
   poor and excellent for pain behavior indicators (kappa = 0.05-0.84).
   These results suggest that registration of pain behavior indicators
   during active, guided movements, as performed by the MOBID procedure,
   is useful to disclose reliable and valid pain intensity scores in
   patients with SCI.

TI Prosthetic vascular graft infection: The role of F-18-FDG PET/CT
SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE PET/CT; infection; prosthetic vascular graft
ID POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; FDG PET; MANAGEMENT; CANCER; FUSION
AB Graft infection after prosthetic vascular reconstruction is an uncommon
   but severe complication. The clinical presentation is often subtle and
   nonspecific and may occur long after surgery. Although defining a
   prosthetic vascular graft infection can be difficult, early diagnosis
   and treatment are important because of the relatively high rates of
   amputation and death. The present study assessed the role of PET/CT
   using F-18-FDG for the diagnosis of vascular graft infections. Methods:
   Thirty-nine patients (35 men and 4 women; age range, 44-82 y) with
   suspected vascular graft infection underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT. The
   performance of PET/CT for the diagnosis of an infectious process and
   its localization to the graft or soft tissues was assessed. The final
   diagnosis was based on histopathologic findings and microbiologic
   assays obtained at surgery or on clinical and imaging follow-up.
   Results: PET/CT detected foci of increased 18F-FDG uptake suspected as
   infection in 27 patients and localized these findings to the graft in
   16 patients. Vascular graft infection was confirmed in 14 of these
   patients (88%). PET/CT excluded graft involvement in 11 patients, and
   in 10 (91 %) of these 11, long-term follow-up further confirmed that
   the infectious process was limited to surrounding soft tissues only. No
   abnormal 18F-FDG uptake was found in any of the 12 patients with no
   further evidence of infection. PET/CT had a sensitivity of 93%,
   specificity of 91%, positive predictive value of 88%, and negative
   predictive value of 96% for the diagnosis of vascular graft infection.
   Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET/CT is a reliable noninvasive imaging modality
   for the diagnosis of vascular graft-related infection. The precise
   anatomic locaiization of increased 18F-FDG uptake provided by PET/CT
   enables accurate differentiation between graft and soft-tissue
   infection.

   MODEL; 2-PHASE FLOW; CAPILLARY-PRESSURE; DYNAMIC PROPERTIES; PORE

AB A key performance limitation in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC),
   called the mass transport loss, originates from liquid water transport
   and resulting flooding phenomena in the constituent components. The
   cathode gas diffusion layer (GDL) is a primary contributor to mass
   transport loss owing to the blockage of available pore space by liquid
   water thereby rendering hindered oxygen transport to the active
   reaction sites in the electrode. The GDL, typically a fibrous non-woven
   carbon paper or a woven carbon cloth, thus plays an important role in
   the water management of a PEFC. This Feature Article provides a
   systematic description of the development of pore-scale models coupled
   with realistic microstructural delineation as well as micron-resolution
   imaging techniques to study the profound influence of the underlying
   structure and surface wettability on liquid water transport and
   interfacial dynamics in the fuel cell GDL. A pore-network model and a
   two-phase lattice Boltzmann model coupled with stochastic generation of
   GDL microstructures are elaborated. Concurrently, optical diagnostics
   of water dynamics at GDL interfaces and X-ray micro-tomographic imaging
   of liquid water distribution inside the GDL of an operating fuel cell
   are discussed.

TI Medicare quality improvement organizations' ambulatory drug therapy
   improvement activities and partnerships with Medicare Part D
   prescription drug plans and Medicare advantage plans
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE PHARMACY
LA English
DT Article
AB BACKGROUND: The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) has provided an
   opportunity for quality improvement organizations (010s) to partner
   with Medicare Part D plan sponsors. These new relationships have
   developed into a set of diverse projects, each approved by the Centers
   for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
   OBJECTIVE: To provide information about the scope of the projects being
   conducted by the QlOs and their partners.
   SUMMARY. The document describes a variety of quality improvement
   projects addressing medication use by beneficiaries enrolled in
   Medicare Part D. Private Medicare 010 contractors are implementing
   these projects in each state. Descriptions of each project were
   developed by individual OlOs with the assistance of lead staff for the
   Physician Practice/Pharmacy QIO Support Center for all 010s nationwide.
   These projects vary in their complexity, in the quality measures used,
   and in the clinical processes and economic impact they seek to improve.
   The summaries in this supplement were prepared 6 months into the
   current 3-year contract period, which began August 2006. Accordingly,
   the summaries reflect varying stages of development, funding reductions
   could occur that necessitate project redesign, and projects have not
   yet been evaluated. With few exceptions, these projects are not
   designed as research but as quality improvement projects following the
   "Plan, Do, Study, Act" model for speeding acceptance of evidence-based
   practice.
   CONCLUSIONS: This survey describes the promise of partnerships whose
   value will be fully realized in future years. The results of these
   early 010 initiatives will not be available until projects are
   evaluated, but OlOs and many Medicare Part D plans have established
   promising partnerships and have begun to share data for the purpose of
   assessing and improving plan and practitioner performance as well as
   patient engagement. Most projects are focused on ambulatory care, but
   some OlOs are addressing nursing home care and continuity of care
   between settings. Most ambulatory care projects are limited to
   prescription drug claims data, but a few plans are providing medical
   and lab data to QlOs in addition to drug claims. 010s have historically
   worked almost exclusively with physicians and nurses but in many states
   are now engaged with colleges of pharmacy as well as with managed care
   and community pharmacists. 010 partnerships will provide managed care
   organizations and pharmacists with the opportunity for innovative
   quality improvement initiatives that might not otherwise be possible
   because of limitations of available data or resources. Pharmacists can
   use this document to review a wide array of options for working with
   OlOs and other partners in their market to design or strengthen their
   organization's medication therapy management and quality improvement
   programs. Managed care pharmacists may be particularly interested in
   the ability of OlOs to assist them in comparing their plans'
   performance with other national and regional plans.

TI Integrated buffer and route management in a DTN with message ferry
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE disruption tolerant network; buffer management; ferry route design;
   performance evaluation; fairness
AB Unlike normal wireless ad hoc networks, end-to-end connection may not
   exist in DTNs Thus, the Message Ferrying (MF) scheme has been proposed
   as a strategy for providing connectivity in disruption tolerant network
   (DTN)s, where a set of nodes called ferries are responsible for
   carrying messages for all nodes in the networks. In such store-
   and-forward networks, buffers at ferry and regular nodes become
   critical resources and need to be allocated fairly among different
   users. In this paper, we propose a max-min fairness model for a DTN
   with a message ferry. Based on this model, we propose a buffer
   allocation scheme that can achieve fairness among different sessions.
   We also design an integrated buffer and routing management scheme
   called buffer efficient routing scheme (BERS). Via simulations, we
   demonstrate that our fair buffer allocation scheme assigns buffers
   fairly to different sessions. Our simulation studies also show that
   BERS can achieve higher session throughput and lower packet delivery
   latency than the only-store-and-forward routing scheme that is
   typically used in a message ferry system.

AB Calibration of hydrologic models is very difficult because of
   measurement errors in input and response, errors in model structure,
   and the large number of non-identifiable parameters of distributed
   models. The difficulties even increase in arid regions with high
   seasonal variation of precipitation, where the modelled residuals often
   exhibit high heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. On the other hand,
   support of water management by hydrologic models is important in and
   regions, particularly if there is increasing water demand due to
   urbanization. The use and assessment of model results for this purpose
   require a careful calibration and uncertainty analysis. Extending
   earlier work in this field, we developed a procedure to overcome (i)
   the problem of non-identifiability of distributed parameters by
   introducing aggregate parameters and using Bayesian inference, (ii) the
   problem of heteroscedasticity of errors by combining a Box-Cox
   transformation of results and data with seasonally dependent error
   variances, (iii) the problems of autocorrelated errors, missing data
   and outlier omission with a continuous-time autoregressive error model,
   and (iv) the problem of the seasonal variation of error correlations
   with seasonally dependent characteristic correlation times. The
   technique was tested with the calibration of the hydrologic sub-model
   of the Soil and Water Assessment Toot (SWAT) in the Chaohe Basin in
   North China. The results demonstrated the good performance of this
   approach to uncertainty analysis, particularly with respect to the
   fulfilment of statistical assumptions of the error model. A comparison
   with an independent error model and with error models that only

TI A hybrid deterministic-fuzzy rule based model for catchment scale

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE fuzzy rules; hydrological model; nitrate transport model; optimisation;

ID NITROGEN DYNAMICS; TRANSPORT; METHODOLOGY; RIVER
AB Current understanding of nitrate export from catchments indicates that
   the transport dynamics are mainly driven by hydrological processes
   characterised by complex nonlinear relationships. The aim of this paper
   is to develop a hybrid deterministic-fuzzy rule based model capable of
   simulating catchment scale nitrate transport on the basis of the
   relationships between driving and resultant variables. The
   deterministic water balance model WaSiM-ETH is used for the simulation
   of hydrological flow components. The simulated flow components from the
   WaSiM-ETH model together with observations are used to develop a fuzzy
   rule based nitrate transport model. The fuzzy rules are derived using a
   simulated annealing optimisation procedure supplemented by knowledge
   about data relationships. The study is undertaken using daily time step
   data from the Weida catchment. in the North-Eastern Germany, which is a
   100 km(2) subcatchment of the Weisse Elster river in the Elbe river
   basin. The models show reasonable performance with regards to the
   magnitude and dynamics of the streamflow, and nitrate-N concentration
   and load. The superior performance of the fuzzy rule based model in
   comparison to a multiple linear regression model indicates a complex
   nonlinear relationship between driving and resultant variables. The
   assessment of the rules provides explicit insights on the qualitative
   and quantitative relationships between different variables and their
   relative importance. The subsurface flow is found to be the most
   important variable which corresponds to the prevailing understanding
   that the nitrate transport processes are mainly driven by it. The
   relative importance of temperature as an input variable indicates the
   effect of seasonal. variability. The hybrid model is valid for present
   land use characteristics and management practices, which can be
   extended to include additional variables that affect nitrate entry to
   subsurface flow. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Productivity of olive orchards in response to tree density
SO JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EFFICIENCY; GROWTH; YIELD; WATER
AB Tree density in newly planted olive orchards has been increasing
   steadily as part of the intensification of olive oil production.
   Because of the importance that harvest costs have on the profitability
   of this crop, the mechanisation of harvesting operations has been an
   important goal. Hedgerow plantations at very high densities have been
   proposed as a means of reducing harvest costs by using an over-the-tree
   harvester. We conducted an 8-year experiment in Cordoba, Southern
   Spain, to evaluate the performance of olive orchards at four planting
   densities that included: a) the conventional density under irrigated
   conditions of 204 trees ha(-1) (7 m x 7 m; D1); b) 408 trees ha(-1) (7
   m x 3.5 m; 132); 816 trees ha(-1) (3.5 m x 3.5 m; D3); and, almost
   1,904 trees ha(-1) (3.5 m x 1.5 m; D4), the recommended density for the
   hedgerow system. Yields for the first 3 years of production were
   highest in D4, reaching almost 20 t fruit ha(-1) in year-3. Thereafter,
   the need for topping the D4 canopy to 2.5 m, to adapt it to the
   harvester, reduced D4 yields drastically. The relationships between
   intercepted radiation, vegetative growth, and reproductive development
   at the branch level, were explored in D4 canopies in 2005 to understand
   the effect of shading on yield-determining processes. At the end of the
   sixth producing year, the cumulative fruit production of D4 was 60,096
   kg ha(-1), while the yields of D1, D2, and D3 were 32,513; 60,125 and
   76,149 kg ha(-1), respectively. Fruit oil content in D4 was less than
   in all the other densities, and cumulative oil yields for the first six
   producing years were 6,829; 12,853; 14,973 and 10,113 kg ha(-1) for D1,
   D2, D3 and D4, respectively. It is concluded that the hedgerow system,
   in its current form and management, is less productive and probably
   less sustainable than orchards planted at densities such as that of D2.

ID CARE; TRIAL; MANAGEMENT; PNEUMONIA; FAILURE
AB Background: Hospital-based clinicians and educators face a difficult
   challenge trying to simultaneously improve measurable quality, educate
   residents in line with ACGME core competencies, while also attending to
   fiscal concerns such as hospital length of stay (LOS).
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of
   multidisciplinary rounds (MDR) on quality core measure performance,
   resident education, and hospital length of stay.
   Design: Pre and post observational study assessing the impact of MDR
   during its first year of implementation.
   Setting: The Norwalk Hospital is a 328-bed, university-affiliated
   community teaching hospital in an urban setting with a total of 44
   Internal Medicine residents.
   Methods: Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
   (JCAHO) core measure performance was obtained on a monthly basis for
   selected heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, and acute myocardial
   infarction (AMI) measures addressed on the general medical service.
   Resident knowledge and attitudes about MDR were determined by an
   anonymous questionnaire. LOS and monthly core measure performance rates
   were adjusted for patient characteristics and secular trends using
   linear spline logistic regression modeling.
   Results: Institution of MDR was associated with a significant
   improvement in quality core measure performance in targeted areas of
   CHF from 65% to 76% (p <.001), AMI from 89% to 96% (p=.004), pneumonia
   from 27% to 70% (p <.001), and all combined from 59% to 78% (p <.001).
   Adjusted overall monthly performance rates also improved during MDR
   (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, CI 1.06-1.12, p <.001). Residents reported
   substantial improvements in core measure knowledge, systems-based care,
   and communication after institution of MDR (p <.001). Residents also
   agreed that MDR improved efficiency, delivery of evidence-based care,
   and relationships with involved disciplines. Adjusted average LOS
   decreased 0.5 (95% CI 0.1-0.8) days for patients with a target core
   measure diagnosis of either CHF, pneumonia, or AMI (p <.01 ) and by 0.6
   (95% CI 0.5-0.7) days for all medicine DRGs (p <.001).
   Conclusions: Resident-centered MDR is an effective process using no
   additional resources that simultaneously improves quality of care while
   enhancing resident education and is associated with shortened length of
   stay.

   DRINKING; VALIDITY
AB Background: Brief alcohol interventions (BAI) reduce alcohol use and
   related problems in primary care patients with hazardous drinking
   behavior. The effectiveness of teaching BAI on the performance of
   primary care residents has not been fully evaluated.
   Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 26
   primary care residents who were randomized to either an 8-hour,
   interactive BAI training workshop (intervention) or a lipid management
   workshop (control). During the 6-month period after training (i.e.,
   from October 1, 2003 to March 30, 2004), 506 hazardous drinkers were
   identified in primary care, 260 of whom were included in the study.
   Patients were interviewed immediately and then 3 months after meeting
   with each resident to evaluate their perceptions of the BAI experience
   and to document drinking patterns.
   Results: Patients reported that BAI trained residents: conducted more
   components of BAI than did controls (2.4 vs 1.5, p=.001); were more
   likely to explain safe drinking limits (27% vs 10%, p=.001) and provide
   feedback on patients' alcohol use (33% vs 21%, p=.03); and more often
   sought patient opinions on drinking limits (19% vs 6%, p=.02). No
   between-group differences were observed in patient drinking patterns or
   in use of 9 of the 12 BAI components.
   Conclusions: The BAI-trained residents did not put a majority of BAI

TI Measuring quality of care in patients with multiple clinical
   conditions: Summary of a conference conducted by the society of general
   internal medicine
SO JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE performance measurement; quality measures; clinically complex patients
ID PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE; COMPETING DEMANDS; DISEASE; DELIVERY; COMORBIDITY;
   DEPRESSION; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; PROFILES; SYSTEM
AB Performance measurement has been widely advocated as a means to improve
   health care delivery and, ultimately, clinical outcomes. However, the
   evidence supporting the value of using the same quality measures
   designed for patients with a single clinical condition in patients with
   multiple conditions is weak. If clinically complex patients, defined
   here as patients with multiple clinical conditions, present greater
   challenges to achieving quality goals, providers may shun them or
   ignore important, but unmeasured, clinical issues. This paper
   summarizes the proceedings of a conference addressing the challenge of
   measuring quality of care in the patient with multiple clinical
   conditions with the goal of informing the implementation of quality
   measurement systems and future research programs on this topic. The
   conference had three main areas of discussion. First, the potential
   problems caused by applying current quality standards to patients with
   multiple conditions were examined. Second, the advantages and
   disadvantages of three strategies to improve quality measurement in
   clinically complex patients were evaluated: excluding certain
   clinically complex patients from a given standard, relaxing the
   performance target, and assigning a greater weight to some measures
   based on the expected clinical benefit or difficulty of reaching the
   performance target. Third, the strengths and weaknesses of potential
   novel measures such change in functional status were considered. The
   group concurred that, because clinically complex patients present a
   threat to the implementation of quality measures, high priority must be
   assigned to a research agenda on this topic. This research should
   evaluate the impact of quality measurement on these patients and expand
   the range of quality measures relevant to the care of clinically
   complex patients.

ID RAW-MATERIAL QUALITY; FISH; INVESTMENT
AB A HACCP-based system is a recognized food safety management program
   aiming at the control of all the factors affecting food safety. It is
   also possible to add factors related to food quality. To evaluate the
   effectiveness of a quality system, a realistic estimate of quality
   costs is essential. The purpose of this work is to develop a
   mathematical model for the calculation of the costs associated with a
   specific quality level due to HACCP-based system implementation.
   Experimental results obtained at Argentinean hake freezing plants
   (Merluccius hubbsi) are presented and compared with those calculated
   with the proposed model. The proportion of variance explained by the
   model was 0.903 for total quality costs; proving its optimum
   performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Equilibrium versus nonequilibrium treatment modeling in the optimal
   design of pump-and-treat groundwater remediation systems
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE

DT Article
ID GRANULAR ACTIVATED CARBON; HETEROGENEOUS POROUS-MEDIA; MASS-TRANSFER;
   ORGANIC-CHEMICALS; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; ALGORITHM; ADSORBERS; PERFORMANCE;
   ADSORPTION; MANAGEMENT
AB The present work proposes that the incorporation of granular activated
   carbon (GAC) treatment model that accounts for nonequilibrium
   adsorption into the optimal design of pump-and-treat systems will
   result in more realistic costs and better-engineered remediation
   systems. It was found that, when nonequilibrium GAC adsorption effects
   are considered, the predicted cost of optimal remediation strategies
   increases consistently when compared to costs obtained assuming
   equilibrium GAC adsorption, for a wide range of cleanup goals. This
   finding implies that when simpler equilibrium models are used for GAC
   adsorption, cleanup costs will be underestimated. GAC treatment costs
   are shown to be particularly sensitive to the degree of mass transfer
   limitations in the aquifer-contaminant system, especially when
   nonequilibrium GAC adsorption is accounted for. Time-varying pumping
   rates are shown to produce more efficient remediation solutions; the
   increase in efficiency is even more pronounced when nonequilibrium GAC
   adsorption is accounted for. Further results show that the optimal
   remediation designs can be significantly more efficient when the number
   of GAC adsorber units is selected through optimization.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the safety and performance of ultrasound-enhanced
   thrombolysis in the treatment of acute thrombotic or embolic occlusion
   of the lower limb arteries.
   Methods: From April 2005 to July 2006, 25 patients (15 men; mean age
   64.1 years, range 3782) presenting with acute (<14 days old) occlusions
   of the lower limb arteries were treated with local thrombolysis
   [recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)] in a dosage of 1.0
   mg/h using the EKOS Lysus Peripheral Catheter System with an ultrasound
   core. No bolus injection of rtPA was given. The mean occlusion length
   was 25.1 cm (range 2-70).
   Results: The technical success rate was 100%. Total clot removal was
   achieved in 22 (88%) patients after 16.9 hours (range 5-24) using a
   mean 17 mg (range 5-25) of rtPA. In 8 cases, total clot removal of the
   main lesion was achieved after 6 hours (6 mg of rtPA). In 1 patient,
   lysis was stopped after 2.5 hours because of bleeding due a dislocation
   of the introducer sheath. In 2 cases, total clot removal could not be
   achieved; these patients were successfully treated with
   thromboaspiration. At the 1-month follow-up, the treated vessel was
   still patent in 20 patients. Two reocclusions occurred; 1 was treated
   with a bypass graft and the other with conservative therapy. There were
   no cases of amputation or death during follow-up. There were no side
   effects related to rtPA or the catheter system.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that local lysis of acute arterial
   occlusions using the Lysus Peripheral Catheter System is safe and
   effective. Blood flow is restored quickly.

ID REASONING SYSTEMS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; KNOWLEDGE; MODELS; TIME
AB The decision-making process in the field of health-care facility
   management is multifaceted and encompasses many different areas,
   including maintenance, performance, risk, operations, and development.
   Information and communications technologies are perceived as the
   interface that integrates these topics. The main objective of this
   research is to develop a decision-support system based on core
   parameters affecting the performance of health-care facilities. This
   paper presents the preliminary development of a quantitative integrated
   health-care facility management model, subdivided into the following
   three interfaces: input, reasoning evaluator and predictor, and output.
   The model proposes the following five modules: maintenance, performance
   and risk, energy and operations, business management. and development.
   It offers projection of maintenance costs, performance, and risk of
   built facilities in the health-care sector. The model hypotheses are
   that age, occupancy, and environment affect the maintenance of the
   facility. These factors are quantitatively developed and analyzed for
   performance-based maintenance planning, employing an occupancy
   coefficient and a projection of performance indicator. Simulations of
   the facility coefficient for different combinations of occupancy and
   environment reveal that the occupancy level is a major factor that

   CHOP
AB Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma ( IVLBCL) is a rare form of diffuse
   LBCL characterized by preferential intravascular growth of malignant
   lymphocytes, aggressive behavior, and an often fatal course. IVLBCL
   usually affects elderly patients with poor performance status, elevated
   lactic dehydrogenase serum levels, anemia, and B symptoms. It displays
   some differences in clinical presentation among diverse geographical
   areas, mostly between patients diagnosed in Western countries and
   Japan. In addition, data from the literature suggest that pathologic
   diagnostic criteria as well as clinical features of this disease may be
   broader than described in current classification scheme( s). Under the
   sponsorship of the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group,
   clinicians and pathologists with interest in IVLBCL, coming from
   Western and Eastern countries, joined to reach a consensus on defining
   features as well as to focus on the most urgent unresolved issues in
   IVLBCL. To this end, a representative group of IVLBCL patients coming
   from both the aforementioned geographical areas were collectively
   analyzed. Additional features of IVLBCL were proposed both under
   clinical and pathologic stand points. At the meeting, it emerged that
   IVLBCL may have additional histopathologic/cytologic definition
   criteria with respect to those currently recommended, some clinical
   features are not randomly distributed worldwide, recent therapeutic
   approaches, such as anti-CD20-containing regimens, may improve outcome,
   and kidney, spleen, and liver involvement may show peculiar
   histopathologic features. Finally, a provisional practical diagnostic
   approach to hemophagocytosis-associated patients and a proposal for the
   most useful criteria in the settings of differential diagnosis are
   included.

TI Anaerobic digestion of liquid dairy manure using a sequential
   continuous-stirred tank reactor system
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE anaerobic digestion; dairy manure; completely mixed; plug-flow
ID WASTE-WATER; ANIMAL WASTE; SEPARATION; ACID; PERFORMANCE; SLUDGE
AB BACKGROUND: Anaerobic digestion of liquid manure from flush dairy
   operations is an alternative to manure management practices with
   environmental benefits and producing biogas. A unique sequential
   reactor system was used to study the anaerobic digestion (AD) of flush
   dairy manure with the aim of determining (1) the effects of organic
   strength of the influent on AD performance; (2) whether phase
   separation is beneficial to treatment and AD design; and (3) whether
   there is any difference between completely mixed and plug-flow
   approaches to implementing the AD process.
   RESULTS: The influent with high organic strength resulted in higher
   levels of biogas production and chemical oxygen demand (COD)/solids
   removal. When the manure stream is used as influent for the anaerobic
   digestion, the phenomenon of two-stage anaerobic digestion process does
   not exist because the stream contained high levels of alkalinity and
   volatile fatty acids. The biogas production and COD/solids destruction
   achieved by plug-flow and completely mixed reactor were very similar
   when treating the liquid manure stream.
   CONCLUSION: The organic strength of the influent significantly
   influenced AD performance. The plug-flow reactor and the completely
   mixed reactor had a similar AD performance. For the type of manure and
   organic loading rate investigated, the results give indications for
   designing an AD process in flush dairy operations.

AB A new architecture for scalable anonymous communication system(SACS)
   was proposed. The users were divided into several subgroups managed by
   different sub-blenders, and all sub-blenders were managed by the
   main-blender using two layers management scheme. The identity
   information of members are distributed on different sub-blenders, which
   makes each member keep much less information and network overload
   greatly reduce. The anonymity and the overhead of the new scheme were
   analyzed and compared with that of Crowds, which shows the cost of
   storage and network overhead for the new scheme largely decreases while
   the anonymity is little degraded. The experiment results also show that
   the new system architecture is well scalable. The ratio of management
   cost of SACS to that of Crowds is about 1:25 while the value of P(I
   vertical bar H1+) only increases by 0.001-0.020, which shows that SACS
   keeps almost the same anonymity with Crowds.

AB The Purpose To analyze the outcomes of treatment and factors predicting
   effects of imatinib (IM) therapy in inoperable/metastatic
   gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) CD117(+) patients.
   Materials and methods We identified 232 patients in a prospectively
   collected Clinical GIST Registry with advanced inoperable/metastatic
   GIST treated with IM 400-800 mg daily (129 males and 103 females and
   median age 56 years). Median follow-up time was 26 months.
   Results The estimated 3-year progression-free survival (PFS; calculated
   from the date of the start of IM) was 54% and median PFS was 40.5
   months. The following factors significantly and negatively influenced
   PFS in univariate analysis: poor baseline World Health Organization
   (WHO) performance status >= 2 (P < 0.00001), tumor genotype indicating
   other than KIT exon 11 isoform (P = 0.005), baseline high neutrophils
   count (P < 0.00001), age < 45 years at the diagnosis (P = 0.04),
   mitotic index > 10/50 high-power fields (HPF) (P = 0.001), GIST
   histological type other than spindle-cell (P = 0.03), baseline low
   albumin level (P = 0.0005), low baseline hemoglobin level (P <
   0.00001), and primary overtly malignant tumors (unresectable and/or
   metastatic lesions at presentation) (P = 0.05). We identified four
   factors negatively affecting PFS, statistically significant (P < 0.05)
   in multivariate analysis: baseline poor WHO performance status >= 2,
   high baseline neutrophils count (> 5 x 10(9)/l), tumor genotype
   indicating the presence of non-exon 11 KIT mutant and mitotic index >
   10/50 HPF.
   Conclusions We confirmed that many advanced GIST patients benefit from
   IM therapy for a prolonged time, although resistance to therapy is
   observed. We identified four independent biological factors influencing
   the PFS during long-term IM therapy.

TI Screening library evolution through automation of solution preparation
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING
LA English
DT Article
DE compound management; automated weighing; automated solution production;

ID COMPOUND; COLLECTION; DISCOVERY
AB The quality of the compound library is a critical success factor in
   every high-throughput screening campaign. Screening solutions have to
   be prepared with a high level of process control to ensure the correct
   identity and initial concentration of each compound. However, even
   under optimized storage conditions, a certain level of degradation in
   solution cannot be avoided. Therefore, regular quality control and
   eventual removal of solutions from the screening deck is necessary.
   Because solution preparation, especially the weighing of compounds, is
   a tedious and often manual task, a regular resolubilization of
   compounds is difficult to achieve. By complete automation of the
   solution preparation, the authors have laid the foundation for a life
   cycle management of screening solutions. They demonstrate how a
   combination of quality and process control leads to a continuous
   improvement of the screening library. In presenting an automation
   concept, they show how a series of innovative process optimizations led
   to a high-performance system that achieves full industrialization of
   solution preparation.

AB Background: Symptomatic gallstone is one of the most common diseases in
   Taiwan. The aim of this study was to develop a Mandarin Chinese
   outcomes measure for the assessment on quality of life among gallstone
   patients. Materials and Methods: The Gastrointestinal Quality of Life
   Index (GIQLI) is a valid, disease-specific measure for the evaluation
   of health status and treatment effectiveness for adults with chronic
   gastrointestinal condition. The GIQLI was translated into Mandarin
   Chinese using a parallel model. The Chinese ( Taiwan) version of the
   GIQLI (CGIQLI) was administered to 102 patients with symptomatic
   gallstone disease in a prospective manner; the CGIQLI then was
   validated according to established criteria for reliability, validity,
   and longitudinal sensitivity. Results: The CGIQLI demonstrates good
   test-retest reliability ( r = 0.92, P < 0.001) and internal consistency
   (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92). The CGIQLI significantly correlates with the
   Mandarin Chinese ( Taiwan) version of the generic 36-Item Short-Form
   Health Survey (SF-36). The standardized response mean for the CGIQLI
   total score is 0.96, indicating excellent sensitivity to clinical
   change in the study group. Conclusion: This validation study
   demonstrated that the performance characteristics of the CGIQLI are
   equivalent to the English version, the GIQLI. This study demonstrates
   that the CGIQLI is a valid tool to evaluate adults with chronic
   gastrointestinal problems among the Chinese-speaking population.

DE virtual geographic environments; 3D spatial index; R-tree; spatial
   cluster grouping
AB A three-dimensional (3D) spatial index is required for real time
   applications of integrated organization and management in virtual
   geographic environments of above ground, underground, indoor and
   outdoor objects. Being one of the most promising methods, the R-tree
   spatial index has been paid increasing attention in 3D geospatial
   database management. Since the existing R-tree methods are usually
   limited by their weakness of low efficiency, due to the critical
   overlap of sibling nodes and the uneven size of nodes, this paper
   introduces the k-means clustering method and employs the 3D overlap
   volume, 3D coverage volume and the minimum bounding box shape value of
   nodes as the integrative grouping criteria. A new spatial cluster
   grouping algorithm and R-tree insertion algorithm is then proposed.
   Experimental analysis on comparative performance of spatial indexing
   shows that by the new method the overlap of R-tree sibling nodes is
   minimized drastically and a balance in the volumes of the nodes is
   maintained. (c) 2007 International Society for Photogrammetry and

ID INFILTRATION PARAMETERS; ADVANCE DATA
AB A simple real-time control system for furrow irrigation is proposed
   that predicts the infiltration characteristic of the soil in real time
   using data measured during an irrigation event, simulates the
   irrigation, and determines the optimum time to cut-off for that
   irrigation. The basis of the system is a new method for estimating the
   soil infiltration characteristic under furrow irrigation, previously
   developed by the authors, that uses a model infiltration curve, and a
   scaling process to predict the infiltration characteristic for each
   furrow and each irrigation event. Using the new method, infiltration
   parameters were calculated for two different fields. The SIRMOD
   simulation model was then used to simulate irrigation performance under
   different model strategies. These were framed to assess the feasibility
   of, and demonstrate the gains from, the real-time control strategy. The
   simulation results showed that the system is feasible. The scaled
   infiltration gave predictions of the irrigation performance comparable
   to the measured performance, clearly establishing the suitability of
   this method for use in real-time control. The results further indicated
   that under simple real- time control the irrigation performance for the
   two fields could be greatly improved with reductions in the total
   volume of water applied to the two fields of 20 and 60% respectively,
   indicating the scale of benefits that can be achieved in the irrigation
   sector by implementing simple real-time control. Copyright (c) 2007

TI Performance measurement systems for knowledge management in high
   technology industries: a balanced scorecard framework
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT

ID PRODUCT; STRATEGY; FIRMS
AB Effectively implementing Knowledge Management (KM) is a strategic
   process and requires a balanced performance measurement system in high
   technology industries. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a comprehensive
   performance measurement model that aligns measurements with a firm's
   strategy and organises measurements into four perspectives, namely,
   financial, customer, internal business process and learning and growth.
   By analysing the data collected from high technology firms in Taiwan,
   this paper analyses the relative weights placed on the four
   perspectives of measurements in a BSC framework for KM. In such a
   performance measurement system for high technology industries, the
   performance measurements related to the internal business process
   perspective obtain the highest weight. This result suggests that
   measuring the performance of the internal business process perspective
   is more important than that of three other perspectives for high-tech
   firms. This paper provides evidence showing that high technology firms
   having a clear description of KM strategy, and linking rewards to KM
   are more likely to pay attention to measurement performance for KM,
   especially, the performance measurements related to the customer and
   internal business process perspectives.

AB This paper is an empirical study exploring the effects of intellectual
   capital and Dynamic Capabilities (DC) on Innovative Performance (IP) of
   organisations. Data were collected from a survey of 100 Taiwan
   companies related to the electronic and Information Technology (IT)
   industries. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression
   analysis. Results show that Structural Capital (SC) and Relationship
   Capital (RC) fully mediate the effects of Human Capital (HC) on IP.
   Moreover, DC have a direct effect on IP. Dynamic capabilities, on the
   other hand, enhance the positive effect of RC on IP. The implication of
   the study is that managers should build and cultivate the firm's
   dynamic capabilities, because of its significant main and moderating
   effects.

AB Most of the previous studies in global R&D were focused on developed
   economies, meaning the situation of developing countries has been
   neglected. Consequently, this work conducts a deep case study of eight
   Taiwanese companies with overseas R&D units. The sample companies came
   mainly from two industrial sectors: computer hardware and software.
   Preliminary research findings include the following: (1) firms in
   developing countries seem all to follow a similar path in
   internationalising their R&D activities, (2) companies from developed
   and developing countries appear to have the same motivations and use
   the similar methods in globalising their R&D, (3) communication and
   managerial process of global innovation differ for hardware and
   software product developments and (4) problems of communication,
   language and cultural difference critically affect the performance of
   global R&D and can be reduced by employing standard manuals, a unified
   language and international liaisons.

DE agave; sustainability index; native species; exploitation
AB Agave is a native plant utilized for mezcal and tequila production.
   Since 1997, Agave exploitation has been increasing, leading to possible
   ecological deterioration and without social and economic benefits for
   the rural population. A sustainability index was developed for
   1990-2001, including social, economic and ecological indicators related
   to Agave exploitation at Zacatecas, Mexico. Increases in the rural
   population have had a negative effect on Agave sustainability, directly
   affecting the ecological component of sustainability. Increased Agave
   exploitation has not improved the socio-economic components and has
   negatively affected the ecological indicators. All these factors
   resulted in a low (= 0.6) sustainability index. A lack of appropriate
   management may have led to the exploitation of native plants, leading
   to ecological deterioration of the local plant populations, without
   contributing to socio-economic improvement for the human population.
   The model using the sustainability index may also be validated for
   other species within this region.

AB The introduction of digital video broadcasting (DVB) satellite systems
   has become an important tool for future mobile communication and is
   currently a focus in several research areas such as the integration of
   DVB satellite systems with different wireless technologies. This
   tutorial consists of two parts, Enabling technologies and Future
   service scenarios, which aims to provide an introduction to the current
   state-of-the-art of DVB standards over satellite and its fusion with
   mobile and Internet technologies.
   This paper, Enabling technologies, focuses on providing an overview of
   the different technologies and issues that facilitates better
   understanding of the current and future operational scenarios, whereas
   the second paper, Future service scenarios will emphasize. future
   research directions in this research area. In the first part, the paper
   will initially be focused on the introduction of different DVB
   satellite systems, i.e. DVB-via satellite (DVB-S), DVB return channel
   by satellite (DVB-RCS) and second-generation DVB system for broadband
   satellite services (DVB-S2). This is then followed by a description of
   the different Internet Protocol (IP) technologies used to support
   macro- and micro-mobility and the migration strategies from IP version
   4 (IPv4) to IP version 6 (lPv6). Finally, the different security
   mechanisms for the DVB system and end-to-end satellite network are
   addressed. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper proposes the concept of the virtual enterprise broker as an
   innovative model to design and create build to order supply chains. The
   build to order supply chain responds to the demands of new global
   manufacturing economy offering high level of customisation, high
   customer driven design, volume flexibility, short cycle time, no
   inventory costs, minimal total cost and supply chain integration. A
   review of different manufacturing operational models, including make to
   stock, make to order, assembly to order, engineer to order and
   configure to order, is presented to set the context for the
   requirements of build to order operations. The virtual enterprise
   broker is proposed as a structure driven strategy to support the
   creation of dynamic supply chains to satisfy build to order
   requirements. The virtual enterprise broker strategy is described in
   terms of core processes and competencies. We also demonstrate of how
   the virtual enterprise broker strategy has been implemented in various
   industrial scenarios related to supply maintenance tooling for the
   aerospace industry, standard parts for capital goods equipment, and
   design and manufacturing of medical devices.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; PERFORMANCE
AB Background, Aims, and Scope. A significant shift towards services has
   occurred globally though service industry companies are still,
   typically, neglected when the significant environmental players in the
   society are listed. However, scientific evidence is increasingly
   showing that the service sector may produce a notable share of the
   environmental impact in the society. Unfortunately, very few
   quantitative studies exist that would have determined the
   environmentally significant processes of a service industry
   organization. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to quantify the
   environmental impact of selected service industry companies, and to
   identify the processes with the highest environmental contribution.
   Methods. A multiple case study method with life cycle assessment (LCA)
   framework using both process and input-output data was used to estimate
   the environmental impact of four service industry organizations in
   Europe and the U.S. The companies studied are all international or
   global companies, and the functional unit of the LCA is the yearly
   operation of the organization per employee. The firms chosen have
   noticeable differences in terms of size, location, and their line of
   business.
   Results. Regardless the significant differences in the size, location
   and line of business, the same activities were always found to
   contribute the most on the environmental impact of the organizations.
   The office premises clearly contributed the most (some 40%) to the
   environmental impact and commuting was the second most significant
   contributing factor (some 20%). The contribution of all the other
   activities, the business travel, the purchases services, the use of
   office equipment and the office supplies was found to be clearly less
   significant. The U.S. based case was found to produce constantly higher
   impact values than all the other cases. The range of differences
   between the U.S. case and the others were quite substantial: around
   two- to five-fold. Interestingly, it seemed that the differences in
   impacts were explained half by the differences in the surrounding
   infrastructure and supply chain, and half by the differences in the
   actual operating quantities of the studied organizations.
   Discussion. As the results were not particularly sensitive to the
   changes from company specific processes to the statistical averages in
   Finland, they could be expected to give a relatively good estimation of
   a typical Finnish organization in the relevant fields of services
   industry. However, services industry includes a broad scope of
   different kinds of companies, and thus the results would probably not
   apply for all services companies, for example, travel agencies and
   cleaning services.
   Conclusions. The result would imply that in several services sectors
   the office premises related processes could potentially produce
   significant amount of environmental impacts. In addition, it seems that
   the LCA method could produce added value for environmental management
   in services companies because, at the moment, the focus of the
   environmental objectives there appear biased toward activities not
   having high environmental importance.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. Based on the results, many
   organizations could start their environmental work by concentrating on
   the office premises related processes. In the future, the environmental
   significance of services industries in the society should be studied
   more thoroughly, as the services industry could, based on the results
   of the study, offer an untapped management potential for sustainable
   communities.

AB We describe the rationale behind the design of key features of
   Titanium-an explicitly parallel dialect of Java for high-performance
   scientific programming-and our experiences in building applications
   with the language. Specifically, we address Titanium's partitioned
   global address space model, single program multiple data parallelism
   support, multi-dimensional arrays and array-index calculus, memory
   management, immutable classes (class-like types that are value types
   rather than reference types), operator overloading, and generic
   programming. We provide an overview of the Titanium compiler
   implementation, covering various parallel analyses and optimizations,
   Titanium runtime technology and the GASNet network communication layer.
   We summarize results and lessons learned from implementing the NAS
   parallel benchmarks, elliptic and hyperbolic solvers using adaptive
   mesh refinement, and several applications of the immersed boundary
   method.

TI An approach to data distributions in Chapel
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE high productivity language; chapel; user-defined data distributions;
   locality
ID HIGH-PERFORMANCE FORTRAN
AB A key characteristic of today's high performance computing systems is a
   physically distributed memory, which makes the efficient management of
   locality essential for taking advantage of the performance enhancements
   offered by these architectures. Currently, the standard technique for
   programming such systems involves the extension of traditional
   sequential programming languages with explicit message-passing
   libraries, in a processor-centric model for programming and execution.
   It is commonly understood that this programming paradigm results in
   complex, brittle, and error-prone programs, because of the way in which
   algorithms and communication are inextricably interwoven.
   This paper describes a new approach to locality awareness, which
   focuses on data distributions in high-productivity languages. Data
   distributions provide an abstract specification of the partitioning of
   large-scale data collections across memory units, supporting
   coarse-grain parallel computation and locality of access at a high
   level of abstraction. Our design, which is based on a new programming
   language called Chapel, is motivated by the need to provide a
   high-productivity paradigm for the development of efficient and
   reusable parallel code. We present an object-oriented framework that
   allows the explicit specification of the mapping of elements in a
   collection to memory units, the control of the arrangement of elements
   within such units, the definition of sequential and parallel iteration
   over collections, and the formulation of specialized allocation
   policies as required for advanced applications. The result is a concise
   high-productivity programming model that separates algorithms from data
   representation and enables reuse of distributions, allocation policies,
   and data structures.

AB Two studies involving 265 participants were conducted to assess the
   content and range of strategies used by employees to age successfully
   in the work-place. Study 1 included 64 individuals ranging in age from
   23 to 61. These individuals were asked to list up to five activities
   they have pursued in five potentially important areas of development.
   Content analyses on these activities were then conducted for purposes
   of item development. In the second study, the sample was limited to 201
   older workers, defined as employees age 40 and older. Participants
   completed several scales examining the frequency with which they
   engaged in activities related to successful aging at work. Factor
   analyses indicated seven major types of strategies: 1) Relationship
   Development, 2) Security, 3) Continuous Learning, 4) Stress-Relief, 5)
   Skill Extension, 6) Career Management, and 7) Conscientiousness.
   Analyses indicated that each strategy domain was positively related to
   perceived success. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses
   indicated that Security, Relationship Development, Continuous Learning,
   and Career Management strategies were predictive of success above and
   beyond important characteristics of the individual or employing
   organization. The results also indicated that age moderated the
   relationship between strategy use and perceived success for two
   strategy domains. Relationship Development and Skill Extension
   strategies were less strongly related to perceived success as employees
   aged. Implications of these findings are discussed in relation to
   theory development, application, and future research.

AB Reducing part redundancy because of design arbitrariness is an
   effective measure of improving production volume, of which part
   reengineering is a reasonable and effective approach. The problem was
   formalized, then similarity degree was measured by Euclidean proximity
   through considering similar rules of parts based on properties of
   isostructure, geometry, precision, material and performance indices. A
   similarity matrix could be constructed based on similarity degree, and
   part reengineering arithmetic was advanced based on fuzzy clustering.
   Finally, analysis and adjustment of part reengineering scheme was
   discussed. The strategy and method are effective in an instance of a
   motorcycle-hydraulic-disk brake disk reengineering.

DE Web service; Information retrieval; conceptual index structure; formal

AB With the rising adoption of web services, effective management of web
   services becomes a critical issue in making the paradigm of
   service-oriented computing more practical. In this paper, a novel
   structure, called Vector-based service Lattice (VsLattice), is devised
   to index web services in a semantic way. Each web service is modeled as
   a group of Service Operation Vectors (SOVs) in the vector space, and
   each SOV represents an operation provided by the service. The web
   services, SOVs and the relationship between web services and SOVs form
   the Conceptual Indexing Context (CIC) of a given service collection. In
   the CIC, web services that provide similar operations (functions) are
   conceptually indexed by the same Operation Vector Concepts (OVCs). The
   underlying relationships among the OVCs are captured with the
   VsLattice, which is constructed by adopting the traditional concept
   lattice in a CIC. By taking advantage of the information obtained from
   the VsLattice, a new representation of SOV is devised. Based on this
   representation, a novel service retrieval model and the implemental
   system are developed to retrieve web services efficiently. The
   performance and retrieving quality of the proposed approach has been
   evaluated through a series of experiments.

ID TIME-DELAY SYSTEMS
AB This paper describes the design of active queue management (AQM)
   controllers for a class of TCP communication networks. In TCP/IP
   networks, the packet-dropping probability function is considered as a
   control input. Therefore, a TCP AQM controller was modeled as a
   time-delayed system with a saturated input. The objective of the work
   described here was to design robust controllers capable of achieving
   the desired queue size and guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the
   operating point. To achieve this aim, we have proposed two control
   strategies, namely a static state feedback controller and an
   observer-based controller. By applying the Lyapunov-Krasovskii
   functional approach and the linear matrix inequality technique, control
   laws and delay-independent stability criteria for the AQM controllers
   were derived. The performance of the two control schemes was evaluated
   in various network scenarios via a series of numerical simulations. The
   simulation results confirm that the proposed schemes outperform other
   AQM schemes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; IDENTIFICATION; VISUALIZATION; WEBSOM
AB The self-organizing map (SOM), as a kind of unsupervised neural
   network, has been used for both static data management and dynamic data
   analysis. To further exploit its search abilities, in this paper we
   propose an SOM-based algorithm (SOMS) for optimization problems
   involving both static and dynamic functions. Furthermore, a new SOM
   weight updating rule is proposed to enhance the learning efficiency;
   this may dynamically adjust the neighborhood function for the SOM in
   learning system parameters. As a demonstration, the proposed SOMS is
   applied to function optimization and also dynamic trajectory
   prediction, and its performance compared with that of the genetic
   algorithm (GA) due to the similar ways both methods conduct searches.

TI Petri-nets for formal verification of MAC protocols
SO IET SOFTWARE
LA English
DT Article
ID WIRELESS LANS; IEEE-802.11
AB Full or partial reconfiguration of communications devices offers both
   optimised performance for niche scenario-specific deployments and
   support for de-regulated radio spectrum management. The correctness of
   the protocols or protocol-enhancements being deployed in such a dynamic
   and autonomous manner cannot easily be determined through traditional
   testing techniques. Formal description techniques are a key
   verification technique for protocols. The Petri-net formal description
   technique offers the best combination of intuitive representation,
   toolsupport and analytical capabilities. Having described key features
   and analytical approaches of Reference-nets (an extended Petri-net
   formalism), a case study is presented applying this approach to a
   contemporary research area: IEEE 802.11 centralised control mechanisms
   to support delay-sensitive streams and bursty data traffic. This case
   study showcases the ability both to generate performance-oriented
   simulation results and to determine more formal correctness properties.
   The simulation results allow comparison with published results and show
   that a packet-expiration mechanism places greater demands on the
   contention-free resource allocation, while the mathematical analysis of
   the model reveals it to be free of deadlock and k-bounded with respect
   to resources. The work demonstrates the potential that the Petri-net
   formal method has for analysing process and protocol models to support
   reconfigurable devices.

TI Fuzzy logic approach for prioritisation of radar tasks and sectors of
   surveillance in multifunction radar
SO IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEM
AB The effective allocation of radar resources is essential if
   multifunction radars are to realise their full potential. In the most
   stressing conditions, there will be insufficient resources to carry out
   all the desired radar functions. Therefore the ranking of radar tasks
   is an important sub-problem for radar resource management, particularly
   as resource allocation is likely to be based on the relative importance
   of radar tasks. The development of an adaptive prioritisation
   assignment, fuzzy-reasoning-based algorithm used for ranking targets
   and sectors of surveillance in dynamically changing tactical
   environments has been addressed. The performance of this approach is
   compared with that of other prioritisation methods based on more
   conventional `hard decision logic' and simple fixed prioritisation.

TI Electricity market price spike forecasting and decision making
SO IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION

ID ARIMA MODELS
AB Forecasting price spikes is a timely issue for the deregulated
   electricity market. Traditional price forecasting techniques show poor
   performance in handling price spikes, which usually follow a pattern
   different from the prices under normal market conditions. Therefore,
   novel approaches are required to forecast both the occurrences and
   values of spikes. In this paper a comprehensive study is conducted to
   investigate the performance of several data mining techniques for spike
   forecasting. Another major contribution of this paper is that a novel
   approach is proposed to integrate the spike forecasting process with
   decision-making, and to provide a comprehensive risk management tool
   against spikes. This approach is based on the Naive Bayesian
   Classifier. The benefits/costs of possible decisions are considered in
   the spike forecasting process to achieve the maximum benefits from the
   decisions against price spikes. We give a comprehensive theoretical
   proof of the proposed Bayesian classifier with benefit maximisation
   (BCBM) approach, which empirically demonstrates its effectiveness by
   achieving promising experiment results on real market price datasets.

AB This paper describes a course in Smart Power based on the introduction
   of an innovative educational tool-a preprocessed Smart Power integrated
   circuit. The methodology used to introduce students to the issue of
   Smart Power design, resorting to low cost standard CMOS technology is
   presented. The theoretical support is envisaged to provide the required
   knowledge to specify characteristics and performance of the most common
   blocks used in Smart Power and to develop skills for monolithic
   integration. Through design, simulation, and experimental
   characterization, the students were able to experience the different
   steps of a Smart Power project, from the power device basic switching
   cell mask layout to the final system prototype, in 60 hours of a one
   semester course. The referred Smart Power Integrated Circuit (IC)
   embedding analog and digital basic blocks and high-voltage transistor
   arrays is the key idea to the presented pedagogical methodology. Based
   on this Smart Power IC, different topologies required by power
   electronics and power management systems were implemented. A complete
   system illustrative example-a step-down hard-switching dc-de regulator
   (buck regulator)-implemented by the students is shown and discussed.

DT Article
DE message-passing system; resource management; mutual exclusion; group
   mutual exclusion; quorum-based algorithm
ID COMPUTER-NETWORKS
AB The group mutual exclusion problem extends the traditional mutual
   exclusion problem by associating a type ( or a group) with each
   critical section. In this problem, processes requesting critical
   sections of the same type can execute their critical sections
   concurrently. However, processes requesting critical sections of
   different types must execute their critical sections in a mutually
   exclusive manner. We present a distributed algorithm for solving the
   group mutual exclusion problem based on the notion of surrogate-quorum.
   Intuitively, our algorithm uses the quorum that has been successfully
   locked by a request as a surrogate to service other compatible requests
   for the same type of critical section. Unlike the existing quorum-based
   algorithms for group mutual exclusion, our algorithm achieves a low
   message complexity of O(q) and a low ( amortized) bit-message
   complexity of O(bqr), where q is the maximum size of a quorum, b is the
   maximum number of processes from which a node can receive critical
   section requests, and r is the maximum size of a request while
   maintaining both synchronization delay and waiting time at two message
   hops. As opposed to some existing quorum-based algorithms, our
   algorithm can adapt without performance penalties to dynamic changes in
   the set of groups. Our simulation results indicate that our algorithm
   outperforms the existing quorum-based algorithms for group mutual
   exclusion by as much as 45 percent in some cases. We also discuss how
   our algorithm can be extended to satisfy certain desirable properties
   such as concurrent entry and unnecessary blocking freedom.

AB Although cooperation generally increases the amount of resources
   available to a community of nodes, thus improving individual and

   mistreatment problems through the exposition of one node's resources to
   others. We study such concerns by considering a group of independent,
   rational, self-aware nodes that cooperate using online caching
   algorithms, where the exposed resource is the storage at each node.
   Motivated by content networking applications - including Web caching,
   content delivery networks ( CDNs), and peer-to-peer ( P2P) - this paper
   extends our previous work on the offline version of the problem, which
   was conducted under a game-theoretic framework and limited to object
   replication. We identify and investigate two causes of mistreatment: 1)
   cache state interactions ( due to the cooperative servicing of
   requests) and 2) the adoption of a common scheme for cache management
   policies. Using analytic models, numerical solutions of these models,
   and simulation experiments, we show that online cooperation schemes
   using caching are fairly robust to mistreatment caused by state
   interactions. To appear in a substantial manner, the interaction
   through the exchange of miss streams has to be very intense, making it
   feasible for the mistreated nodes to detect and react to exploitation.
   This robustness ceases to exist when nodes fetch and store objects in
   response to remote requests, that is, when they operate as Level-2
   caches ( or proxies) for other nodes. Regarding mistreatment due to a
   common scheme, we show that this can easily take place when the
   "outlier" characteristics of some of the nodes get overlooked. This
   finding underscores the importance of allowing cooperative caching
   nodes the flexibility of choosing from a diverse set of schemes to fit
   the peculiarities of individual nodes. To that end, we outline an
   emulation-based framework for the development of mistreatment-resilient
   distributed selfish caching schemes.

AB The InfiniBand Architecture ( IBA) is a promising communication
   standard for building clusters and system area networks. However, the
   IBA specification has left out security aspects, resulting in potential
   security vulnerabilities, which could be exploited with moderate
   effort. In this paper, we view these vulnerabilities from three
   classical security aspects - confidentiality, authentication, and
   availability - and investigate the following security issues. First, as
   groundwork for secure services in IBA, we present partition-level and
   queue-pair-level key management schemes, both of which can be easily
   integrated into IBA. Second, for confidentiality and authentication, we
   present a method to incorporate a scalable encryption and
   authentication algorithm into IBA, with little performance overhead.
   Third, for better availability, we propose a stateful ingress filtering
   mechanism to block denial-of-service ( DoS) attacks. Finally, to
   further improve the availability, we provide a scalable packet marking
   method tracing back DoS attacks. Simulation results of an IBA network
   show that the security performance overhead due to
   encryption/authentication on network latency ranges from 0.7 percent to
   12.4 percent. Since the stateful ingress filtering is enabled only when
   a DoS attack is active, there is no performance overhead in a normal
   situation.

ID VIDEO
AB The emerging proxy-based wireless Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
   should to be designed to download huge-size files over fading-affected
   channels. However, from a radio resource management point of view,
   several basic problems still need to be solved for such wireless
   delivery systems to operate efficiently. Specifically, due to the
   fading nature of the downlink channel, a still open basic problem is
   how to design optimal energy-allocation ( for example, scheduling)
   policies that minimize the requested download time when constraints on
   the total available energy and peak energy are simultaneously active.
   In this contribution, this problem is solved for application scenarios
   where the downlink channel is slotted and continuous-state, the carried
   out traffic is elastic, and the resulting conveyed throughput is
   measured by any desired increasing concave rate function. Specifically,
   the optimal energy-allocation policy minimizing the download time is
   computed in closed form, and its performance is compared against that
   of a basic On-Off heuristic energy scheduler on some Rayleigh-faded
   Multiantenna delivery systems of practical interest. The carried out
   performance comparisons point out that the presented optimal policy
   typically may outperform the heuristic one up to two orders of
   magnitude, especially when the delivery system is strongly energy
   limited.

TI Efficiently querying large XML data repositories: A survey

DT Review
DE XML query processing; twig pattern matching
ID QUERIES; STREAMS; INDEXES
AB Extensible Markup Language (XML) is emerging as a de facto standard for
   information exchange among various applications on the World Wide Web.
   There has been a growing need for developing high-performance
   techniques to query large XML data repositories efficiently. One
   important problem in XML query processing is twig pattern matching,
   that is, finding in an XML data tree D all matches that satisfy a
   specified twig ( or path) query pattern Q. In this survey, we review,
   classify, and compare major techniques for twig pattern matching.(1)
   Specifically, we consider two classes of major XML query processing
   techniques: the relational approach and the native approach. The
   relational approach directly utilizes existing relational database
   systems to store and query XML data, which enables the use of all
   important techniques that have been developed for relational databases,
   whereas in the native approach, specialized storage and query
   processing systems tailored for XML data are developed from scratch to
   further improve XML query performance. As implied by existing work, XML
   data querying and management are developing in the direction of
   integrating the relational approach with the native approach, which
   could result in higher query processing performance and also
   significantly reduce system reengineering costs.

TI Efficient process of top-k range-sum queries over multiple streams with
   minimized global error
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Data Stream Management System; top-k queries; wavelet synopses
AB Due to the resource limitation in the data stream environments, it has
   been reported that answering user queries according to the wavelet
   synopsis of a stream is an essential ability of a Data Stream
   Management System (DSMS). In the literature, recent research has been
   elaborated upon minimizing the local error metric of an individual
   stream. However, many emergent applications such as stock marketing and
   sensor detection also call for the need of recording multiple streams
   in a commercial DSMS. As shown in our thorough analysis and
   experimental studies, minimizing global error in multiple-stream
   environments leads to good reliability for DSMS to answer the queries.
   In contrast, only minimizing local error may lead to a significant loss
   of query accuracy. As such, we first study in this paper the problem of
   maintaining the wavelet coefficients of multiple streams within
   collective memory so that the predetermined global error metric is
   minimized. Moreover, we also examine a promising application in the
   multistream environment, that is, the queries for top-k range sum. We
   resolve the problem of efficient top-k query processing with minimized
   global error by developing a general framework. For the purposes of
   maintaining the wavelet coefficients and processing top-k queries,
   several well-designed algorithms are utilized to optimize the
   performance of each primary component of this general framework. We
   also evaluate the proposed algorithms empirically on real and simulated
   data streams and show that our framework can process top-k queries
   accurately and efficiently.

   "G. Savastano" is an e-learning measurement laboratory supported by the
   Italian Ministry of Education and University. It provides the students
   of electric and electronic measurement courses with access to remote
   measurement laboratories, delivering different didactic activities
   related to measurement experiments. The core of the software.
   architecture is the integration of the Learning Management System (LMS)
   with the remotely accessible measurement laboratories through web
   services and thin client paradigm, providing a new approach to remote
   experiments on measurement instrumentation. The overview of this paper
   is on the different solutions concerning the thin client technology,
   and the solution implemented is described. This solution takes into
   account the delivered services to students and teachers and permits
   optimization of the communication performances. The results of the
   comparison among the performances of different implementations of the
   thin client paradigm highlight the advantages of the adopted solution.
   As a consequence, the description of the thin client protocol
   implemented, together with the presentation of the LMS and delivered
   services given in a previous paper, makes an exhaustive analysis of the
   software architecture of the LA.DI.RE. "G. Savastano."

AB Assessing the overall performance of wireless communication networks is
   of key importance for optimal management and planning. With special
   regard to wireless networks operating in an unlicensed band, evaluating
   overall performance mainly implies facing the coexistence issues, which
   are associated with the contemporaneous presence of true and
   interfering signals at the physical layer. This task is difficult to
   fulfill only on the basis of single-layer measurements, if not
   prohibitive; a partial perspective of network behavior would, in fact,
   be gained. With this concern, a cross-layer approach is presented
   hereinafter. It provides for several measurements to be concurrently
   carried out at different layers through a proper-automatic station. It
   aims to correlate the values of the major physical-layer quantities
   (e.g., channel power and signal-to-interference ratio) exhibited by
   those characterizing the key higher layers' parameters (e.g.,
   packet-loss ratio. and one-way delay) in the presence of interference.
   A first step toward a full characterization of how the effects of a
   problem, which is experienced at the physical layer, propagates along
   the whole protocol stack, can thus be taken.

AB We propose a generic framework for jointly optimizing the transmit
   power allocation and the adaptive receive strategies in a multiuser
   network with individual quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The QoS
   is assumed to be a one-to-one mapping of the
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The feasibility of
   certain target QoS depends on the mutual interference and on a given
   sum-power constraint. This coupling can be modeled by interference
   functions, which determine how the transmit powers cause interference
   to the individual users. We show fundamental properties, like
   continuity and feasibility for the most general case when the functions
   are defined by axioms. Additional properties are shown for the case
   when the interference functions are based on a parameter-dependent
   coupling matrix, which allows to apply techniques from the theory of
   nonnegative matrices. We derive a class of iterative algorithms, which
   exploit the matrix structure. The proposed iteration converges
   monotonically to the global optimum. Starting from the same
   initialization, it is better than the known fixed-point iteration. It
   achieves arbitrary QoS values within the QoS-feasible region.

AB An alternative approach is presented to minimize the impact of fiber
   nonlinearities in optical single-sideband systems at 10 Gb/s using
   electrical dispersion precompensation by adding optical
   postcompensation while maintaining low accumulated dispersion.
   Numerical simulation is used to show that the dependence of the system
   performance on the dispersion compensation scheme resembles a
   pseudolinear transmission regime, although it is not considered as such
   in the strictest sense. A launched power increase of 3 dB is achieved
   when compared to full electrically precompensated systems. A feasible
   implementation of the optical transmitter is considered, which imposes
   a maximum transmitted modulation depth. It is shown that low modulation
   depths result in an asymmetric optimum dispersion compensation map.

AB A novel packaging configuration for high-power phosphor-converting
   white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) application is reported. In this
   packaging configuration, a thermal-isolated encapsulant layer was used
   to separate the phosphor coating layer from the LED chip and the
   submount. Experimental and finite-element method simulation results
   proved that this thermal management can prevent the heat of LED chip
   from transferring to the phosphor coating layer. The surface
   temperature of the phosphor coating layer is a 16.8 degrees C lower
   than that of the conventional packaging at 500-mA driver current for
   1-mm(2) power GaN-based LED chip. Experimental results also show that
   this packaging configuration can improve the light-emitting power
   performance and color characteristics stability of the white LED,
   especially under high current operating condition.

   types of SLAs are suggested for all types of traffic from best effort
   to QoS constrained applications. In access networks, where these SLAs
   are prevalent, shared memory switches are a common feature of
   architecture. Thus, dimensioning and management of shared memory queues
   for multiple priorities, each with two levels of guarantees, becomes an
   interesting challenge. We present a simple analysis of a multipriority
   multi-discard-level system controlled by a buffer occupancy threshold
   policy aimed at assuring SLA compliance for conforming (i.e.,
   committed) traffic, and performance maximization for nonconforming
   (i.e., excess) traffic. Our analysis shows how to calculate the
   different system parameters: total buffer size, threshold position, and
   offered load control performance for the committed and excess traffic.
   Our suggested design enables assuring high SLA compliance for
   conforming traffic and performance maximization for nonconforming
   traffic.

TI A cross-layer packet scheduling scheme for multimedia broadcasting via
   satellite digital multimedia broadcasting system
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
ID SERVICES
AB In recent years, multimedia content broadcasting via satellite has
   attracted increased attention. The satellite digital multimedia
   broadcasting (S-DMB) system has emerged as one of the most promising
   alternatives for the efficient delivery of multimedia broadcast
   multicast service (MBMS). The design of an efficient radio resource
   management (RRM) strategy, especially the packet scheduling scheme,
   becomes a key technique for provisioning multimedia services at
   required quality of service (QoS) in S-DMB. In this article, we propose
   a novel cross-layer packet scheduling scheme that consists of a
   combined delay and rate differentiation (CDRD) service prioritization
   algorithm and a dynamic rate matching (DRM)-based resource allocation
   algorithm. The proposed scheme considers multiple key factors that span
   from the application layer to the physical layer, aiming at
   simultaneously guaranteeing diverse QoS while utilizing radio resources
   efficiently under the system power and resource constraints. Simulation
   results demonstrate that the proposed cross-layer scheme achieves
   significantly better performance than existing schemes in queuing
   delay, jitter, and channel utilization.

AB Within the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS), Link
   Management Protocol (LMP) has been proposed to maintain the
   connectivity of the out-of-fiber control plane. In this letter, we
   analytically quantify the impact of control plane link failures on

SO HUMAN FACTORS

ID ATTENTION ALLOCATION; INDEPENDENT AGENT; EVENT-DRIVEN; TEAM PLAY;
   POWERFUL; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; FEEDBACK; SYSTEMS; ERRORS
AB Objective: To examine operator strategies for diagnosing and recovering
   from errors and disturbances as well as the impact of automation design
   and time pressure on these processes. Background: Considerable efforts
   have been directed at error prevention through training and design.
   However, because errors cannot be eliminated completely, their
   detection, diagnosis, and recovery must also be supported. Research has
   focused almost exclusively on error detection. Little is known about
   error diagnosis and recovery, especially in the context of event-driven
   tasks and domains. Method: With a confederate pilot, 12 airline pilots
   flew a 1-hr simulator scenario that involved three challenging
   automation-related tasks and events that were likely to produce
   erroneous actions or assessments. Behavioral data were compared with a
   canonical path to,examine pilots' error and disturbance management
   strategies. Debriefings were conducted to probe pilots' system
   knowledge. Results: Pilots seldom followed the canonical path to cope
   with the scenario events. Detection of a disturbance was often delayed.
   Diagnostic episodes were rare because of pilots' knowledge gaps and
   time criticality. In many cases, generic inefficient recovery
   strategies were observed, and pilots relied on high levels of
   automation to manage the consequences of an error. Conclusion. Our
   findings describe and explain the nature and shortcomings of pilots'
   error management activities. They highlight the need for improved
   automation training and design to achieve more timely detection,
   accurate explanation, and effective recovery from errors and
   disturbances. Application: Our findings can inform the design of tools
   and techniques that support disturbance management in various complex,
   event-driven environments.

AB Aim: To report original and review existing data on safety and
   performance of large-needle aspiration biopsy (LNAB) histology in the
   preoperative selection of palpable thyroid nodule.
   Methods and results: The English literature and original data were
   reviewed or analysed. The literature on LNAB of thyroid nodules did not
   report any complications. A study on needle dimensions has explained
   why LNAB obtains more tissue than fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and is
   safe. LNAB histology has higher specificity than FNA cytology and
   markedly reduces the number of inadequate and indeterminate FNA
   findings. A comparison of 150 FNA-derived cell blocks with 200
   LNAB-derived histological blocks after galectin-3 determination in a
   large nationwide (Italian) study has shown that one to two sections in
   10% of the FNA cell blocks and at least five sections in 90% of the
   LNAB blocks were available for further determinations of thyroid tumour
   markers.
   Conclusion: LNAB merits further consideration for the preoperative
   selection of thyroid nodules.

   ASSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT; BIOPSY; INDEX
AB Clinical factors such as age, gender, alcohol use, and age-at-infection
   influence the progression to cirrhosis but cannot accurately predict
   the risk of developing cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C
   (CHC). The aim of this study was to develop a predictive signature for
   cirrhosis in Caucasian patients. All patients had well-characterized
   liver histology and clinical factors; DNA was extracted from whole
   blood for genotyping. We validated all significant markers from a
   genome scan in the training cohort, and selected 361 markers for the
   signature building. Using a "machine learning" approach, a signature
   consisting of markers most predictive for cirrhosis risk in Caucasian
   patients was developed in the training set (N = 420). The Cirrhosis
   Risk Score (CRS) was calculated to estimate the risk of developing
   cirrhosis for each patient. The CRS performance was then tested in an
   independently enrolled validation cohort of 154 Caucasian patients. A
   CRS signature consisting of 7 markers was developed for Caucasian
   patients. The area-under-the-ROC curves (AUC) of the CRS was 0.75 in
   the training cohort. In the validation cohort, AUC was only 0.53 for
   clinical factors, increased to 0.73 for CRS, and 0.76 when CRS and
   clinical factors were combined. A low CRS cutoff of < 0.50 to identify
   low-risk patients would misclassify only 10.3% of high-risk patients,
   while a high cutoff of > 0.70 to identify high-risk patients would
   misclassify 22.3% of low-risk patients. Conclusion: CRS is a better
   predictor than clinical factors in differentiating high-risk versus
   low-risk for cirrhosis in Caucasian CHC patients. Prospective studies
   should be conducted to further validate these findings.

AB This paper provides insights into how Costa Rican public hospitals
   responded to the pressure for increased efficiency and quality
   introduced by the reforms carried out over the period 1997-2001. To
   that purpose we compute a generalized output distance function by means
   of non-parametric mathematical programming to construct a productivity
   index, which accounts for productivity changes while controlling for
   quality of care. Our results show an improvement in hospital
   performance mainly driven by quality increases. The adoption of
   management contracts seems to have contributed to such enhancement,
   more notably for small hospitals. Further, productivity growth is
   primarily due to technical and scale efficiency change rather than
   technological change. A number of policy implications are drawn from
   these results. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We compare strategies to manage surgical waiting times in Australia,
   Canada, England, New Zealand, and Wales to give policy insights into
   those that are most effective. Most of these countries have allocated
   dedicated funding and set explicit waiting time targets. Of the five
   countries, England has achieved the most sustained improvement, linked
   to major funding boosts, ambitious waiting-time targets, and a rigorous
   performance management system. While supply-side strategies are used in
   all five countries, New Zealand and parts of Canada have also invested
   in demand-side strategies through the use of clinical criteria to
   prioritize access to surgery.

AB This paper discusses a dependable and widely applicable Peer-to-Peer
   (P2P) computing platform. As the existing P2P computing platforms are
   limited due to the lack of support for various computational models,
   this paper proposes a workflow management mechanism to support task
   dependency in parallel programs while increasing computing efficiency.
   In general, task dependency leads to a serious performance degradation
   for failed task re-execution because of volatile peers. Therefore, it
   results in low dependability. Here, dependability is defined as a
   comparison of the actual performance with task failures to the
   theoretical one without failure on a P2P computing platform. Redundant
   task dispatch and a ruintime optimization method are proposed to
   guarantee high dependability even with highly volatile peers.
   Large-scale simulation results indicate that the computing platform
   efficiently solves the problem of P2P computing due to volatile peers.

AB Performance losses due to flooding of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and
   flow fields as well as membrane dehydration are two of the major
   problems in PEFC. In this investigation, the effect of GDL on the cell
   water management in PEFC is studied using segmented and single cell
   experiments. The behaviour of four different commercial GDLs was
   investigated at both high and low inlet humidity conditions by
   galvanostatic fuel cell experiments. The influence of varying reactant
   humidity and gas composition was studied. The results at high inlet
   humidity show that none of the studied GDLs are significantly flooded
   on the anode side. On the other hand, when some of the GDLs are used on
   the cathode side they are flooded, leading to increased mass transfer
   losses. The results at low inlet humidity conditions show that the
   characteristics of the GDL influence the membrane hydration. It is also
   shown that inlet humidity on the anode side has a major effect on
   flooding at the cathode.

AB Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) content in the fuel cell electrode plays
   an important role on the performance of polymer electrolyte membrane
   fuel cell (PEMFC) when the cell is tested under low temperature and
   under ambient pressure. PTFE is added to the PEM fuel cell electrode to
   improve the mechanical strength and to help in removing the product
   water formed on the cathode; however, higher PTFE loading increases the
   resistance and thus decreases the performance of the cell and very low
   PTFE content has the disadvantage of water flooding in long-term
   operation. We have investigated the effect of the PTFE content in the
   gas diffusion media (carbon paper) and in the microlayer on the
   performance of PEMFC operating at ambient pressure. The PTFE contents
   in these two layers have to be finely matched to get the best
   performance of the cells. The polarisation behaviour, electrochemical
   surface area and the electrochemical impedance spectra have been
   analysed. The results are presented in this paper.

AB In this case study, a small-scale biogas plant in treatment of manure
   wastes was proposed for a hen farm (Dortler Farm on Ankara Highway in
   Corum city of Turkey) selected as model pilot plant. A fixed-dome
   Chinese model biogas reactor (FDCMBR) having a digester volume of 280
   m(3) was found to be appropriate in treatment of hen manure wastes.
   Calculations based on design criteria and literature data were
   presented. The proposed biogas plant was designed for local
   possibilities, and low cost conditions based on local information and
   experimental studies given in the literature. In Corum city, the total
   daily biogas production (about 7625 in 3 day(-1)) can be provided from
   individual biogas plants, operating at 58 active hen farms having
   different waste loads. By considering the population of Corum city
   (161000 people), this total production was estimated to compensate the
   daily requirements of 290 families (5 members) including heating,
   cooking, cooling and lighting. The number of people who make use of
   this biogas energy (1452 people) was found to be equal to approximately
   1% of the total population of Corum city. In this case study, revenues
   and expenditures (R&E) were also estimated for the proposed FDCMBR. The
   R&E analysis showed that revenues that can be provided from selling of
   stabilized manure were estimated to be E 15500 per year. This value was
   found to be nearly equal to total operating and construction
   expenditures of the proposed biogas plant. Moreover, results of some
   experimental studies including projection criteria were also presented.
   More importantly, this case study is expected to provide a useful
   background and a scientific contribution in manure management for rural
   areas of Turkey.

AB The objective of this study was to comparatively evaluate five
   nonlinear models on their ability to describe the relationship between
   total height (H; m) and diameter at breast-height (D; cm) within six
   commercially-important boreal stand-types. Specifically, the five
   models evaluated were as follows: (1) the constrained (i.e., H = 1.3
   when D = 0) Chapman-Richards-based model proposed by Peng, Zhang and
   Liu [Peng, C., Zhang, L, Liu, L., 2001. Developing and validating
   nonlinear height-diameter models for major species of Ontario's boreal
   forests. NJAF 18, 87-94; denoted Model 1] which excludes consideration
   of stand-level effects; (2 and 3) the constrained
   Chapman-Richards-based models proposed by Sharma and Zhang [Sharma, M.,
   Zhang, S.Y., 2004. Height-diameter models using stand characteristics
   for Pinus banksiana and Picea mariana. Scand. J. For. Res. 19, 442-451;
   denoted Models 2 and 3] which includes consideration of stand-level
   density effects through the explicit inclusion of density-based
   predictor variables (density (N; stems/ha) and basal area (G;
   m(2)/ha)); and (4 and 5) constrained and unconstrained allometric-based
   models (denoted Models 4 and 5, respectively) derived from a
   multivariate expansion of the equation of simple allometry which
   includes consideration of stand-level effects via the explicit
   inclusion of density and stand developmental predictor variables
   (relative density index (R; %/100) and mean dominant height (H-D; m),
   respectively). The six stand-types considered were (I and 2) natural
   (density unregulated) and managed (density regulated) upland black
   spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands (denoted PIm(UL(N)) and
   PIm(UL(m)), respectively), (3 and 4) natural and managed jack pine
   (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) stands (denoted PNb(N) and PNb(M),
   respectively), (5) natural black spruce-jack pine mixed stands (denoted
   PImPNb((N))), and (6) natural lowland black spruce stands (denoted
   PIMLL(N)). The full dataset, consisting of 26741 H-D measurements and
   associated stand-level variables (N, G, R and H-D) obtained from 985
   sample plots situated throughout the central portion of the Canadian
   Boreal Forest Region, was randomly subdivided into calibration and
   validation subsets of approximately equal size by stand-type. Parameter
   estimates for each model were obtained using the calibration subsets in
   combination with nonlinear regression (Models 1-3) and multiple
   regression (Models 4 and 5) analyses. Employing the validation subsets,
   the calibrated models were evaluated using goodness-of-fit, lack-of-fit
   and prediction error indices at both the diameter class and stand
   levels. The results indicated that the best performing models were as
   follows: (1) Model 3 for PIm(UL(N)); (2) Model 5 for PIm(UL(M)); (3)
   Model 4 for PNb(N); (4) Model 5 for PNb(M); (5) Model 2 for
   PImPNb((N)); and (6) Model 5 for PIm(LL(N)).
   Collectively, these results (1) reconfirms the utility of explicitly
   incorporating stand-level variables within the model specification when
   developing H-D models, (2) demonstrates the superiority of the newly
   introduced allometric-based H-D composite model which incorporates both
   stand density and developmental effects for four of the six stand-types
   assessed, and (3) provides a suite of calibrated functions and
   associated performance metrics for potential use in product recovery
   and value estimation, stand structural analyses, growth and yield
   projection systems, and crbon budgeting models. Furthermore, given the
   success of the allometric-based models derived from the multivariate
   expansion of the equation of simple allometry, suggests that this
   modeling approach may have wider applicability in the (1) development
   of prediction equations for other important dimensional relationships
   used in forest management (e.g., localizing stem taper, volume and
   biomass equations) and (2) study of allometry in general (e.g., provide
   analytical direction in the assessment of population-level effects on
   allometric scaling relationships). Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published

ID STATISTICAL POWER; CONSERVATION; IMPACT
AB The objective of continuous improvement embedded in forest management
   standards relies on the capacity of management to respond appropriately
   to evidence of performance provided by monitoring. This evidence is
   rarely unequivocal. Under a null hypothesis of no effect, two kinds of
   errors in interpretation are possible-inferring an effect where none
   exists (Type I error) and inferring no effect when in fact one exists
   (Type II error). If the monitoring relates to possible improvement in
   growth or yield then a Type I error leads to false optimism and a Type
   II error to false pessimism. If monitoring concerns a potential
   environmental or social impact, a Type I error implies alarmism and a
   Type II error a false sense of security.
   Explicit consideration of statistical power in designing and
   interpreting monitoring data is an effective buffer against these
   errors. However, strict application of statistical power may be
   impractical. In particular, the requirement to specify tolerable error
   rates and effect sizes will be difficult in many circumstances where
   the perspectives of managers, auditors or stakeholders are contested or
   perceived to be arbitrary or vague. We advocate the use of confidence
   intervals as an alternative to power calculations. Confidence intervals
   offer an accessible approach to communicating performance under a
   standard and the extent to which a monitoring program is able to
   distinguish compliance from noncompliance. We illustrate these
   arguments and tools through a hypothetical example involving a proposed
   change in silviculture where the magnitude of gains in yield and
   environmental impacts are unclear. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Saxony, a federal state in the east of Germany, includes regions with a
   history of high deposition rates of total acidity and conspicuous
   impairments of the health status of forests and forest soils. Both the
   reduction Of SO2 immissions and extensive forest liming campaigns have
   led to a visible regeneration of forests, especially in the Saxon low
   mountain ranges. There is a strong need for maps with landscape-related
   information about the forest health status as a basis for an ecological
   underpinning of forest management practices. The aim of the analyses
   presented was to derive a zoning of forest health conditions in Saxony
   on the basis of soil, topographic and vegetation parameters.
   The upscaling approach of the present paper is based on multiple linear
   regression analyses coupled with geostatistics using a two-stage
   procedure with global and regional transfers. First, the forest soil
   monitoring data of Saxony were evaluated using variables derived from a
   digital terrain model, geological information and soil and stand
   related parameters available in high spatial resolution as independent
   variables. In a second step the influence of environmental factors on
   the medium-term crown defoliation was analysed using the modelling
   results from step 1 (regionalized soil chemical attributes) as
   additional auxiliary variables. Spatio-temporally limited damaging
   events were diminished by the plotwise and temporal aggregation of
   defoliation values. Unlike soil chemical data, it was not possible to
   detect clear auto-correlative spatial structures for defoliation
   measurements due to the influence of stand age. About 70-80% of the
   total variance of defoliation could be explained by the multiple linear
   regression models. Methodological limitations and interpretations are
   discussed. Stand age, with 35-64% of the explained variance, showed by
   far the highest influence. This confirms the necessity to quantify the
   influence of the stand age as a systematic and intrinsic natural factor
   if the relationship between defoliation and stress factors is intended
   to be examined. The model performance of the regression algorithms was
   examined using both an independent validation procedure and
   cross-validation terms. Finally, the modelled "mean level of
   defoliation" was mapped using the mean stand age of forests in Saxony
   (60 years) by means of regression equations as scenario models. (c)

AB Seven hundred twenty-nine lines of diverse wheat germplasm lines were
   evaluated in eight locations of three countries (India, Nepal and
   Bangladesh) of South Asia for 5 years (1999-2000 to 2003-2004) through
   Eastern Gangetic Plains Screening Nursery (EGPSN) organized by CIMMYT
   South Asia, Nepal, for agronomic performance and tolerance to spot
   blotch of wheat. Each year, the number of lines represented a new set
   of 150 lines that included six common checks and a different local
   check at each of the eight locations. One hundred and five lines, 21 in
   each year, advanced from EGPSN were also tested for 5 years (2000-2001
   to 2004-2005) in five locations of South Asia through Eastern Gangetic
   Plains Yield Trials (EGPYT) to verify spot blotch tolerance and
   superior yield performance of the selected germplasm. Many lines
   yielded significantly more than the best check and possessed high
   levels of spot blotch resistance under warm humid environments of South
   Asia. The most promising 25 lines have been listed as sources of strong
   resistance, with 9 lines better yielding than the best resistant check
   PBW 343 in fewer days to maturity. Most of these superior lines
   represented elite CIMMYT germplasm and around half were derived from
   Kauz and Veery. The line EGPYT 67,
   Kauz//Kauz/Star/3/Prinia/4/Milan/Kauz, was the best for spot blotch
   resistance, yield, days to maturity, and 1000 grain weight (TKW). The
   next two lines in the order of merit were EGPYT 84
   (Mrng/Buc//Blo/Pvn/3/Pjb 8 1) and EGPYT 69 (Chirya3/Pastor). The
   results demonstrate that additional spot blotch resistant wheat
   genotypes with high grain yield and TKW, and early maturity, have
   become available as a result of the regional and international
   collaboration in South Asia. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In a substantial rice-wheat cropping system area of South Asia, wheat
   sowing often gets too delayed and exposed to terminal heat stress.
   Therefore, farmers prefer varieties that are able to perform well under
   a short growing period. Tissue culturally regenerated plants of wheat
   variety cv. HUW 234, the most widely cultivated variety of North
   Eastern Plain Zone (NEPZ) of India were screened using immature embryo
   as explant. Days to heading and maturity, yield and other yield
   components and resistance to leaf rust and spot blotch were evaluated.
   A few somaclones in R-3 and R-4 generations displayed significant
   earliness for days to heading and maturity, improved yield traits and
   resistance to leaf rust and spot blotch diseases. The superior
   performance of two of the variants was confirmed in the R-5 generation
   in 3 years of testing under two dates of conventional and zero-till
   sowing. Stability analysis also suggested superiority of the two
   somaclones across 12 environments. This appeared to confirm the
   possibility of obtaining useful somaclonat variants of wheat for very
   late sown as well as zero-till managed agriculture. The superior
   performing somaclones can be used as parents in the ongoing breeding
   programmes targeting late sown wheat in South Asia exposed to terminal
   heat stress. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Neoseiulus
   californicus (McGregor) for the control of Tetranychus urticae Koch in
   commercial strawberry fields, under greenhouse conditions, in
   association or not with the use of acaricides. The N. californicus
   strain used in this study was tolerant or resistant to several
   pesticides. Three experiments were carried out in the State of Sao
   Paulo, Brazil. For the first experiment, the initial infestation of T.
   urticae was 87.1 active stages per leaflet. Two applications of
   propargite were made on the first and the 14th day of the experiment.
   Approximately 2 h after each propargite application, N. californicus
   was released at a rate of 3.0 and 1.9 adult mites per plant,
   respectively, for each application. The population of T. urticae
   decreased from 87.1 to 2.8 mites per leaflet in the first three weeks.
   After this period, the population of T. urticae was maintained at low
   levels (<= 1.5 mites/leaflet) until the end of the experiment (10th
   week). Propargite and dimethoate sprayed on the strawberry field did
   not affect significantly the population of this predaceous mite. For
   the second experiment, the infestation of T. urticae was 29.1 mites per
   leaflet, when the acaricide chorfenapyr was applied on the strawberry
   field. The release of N. californicus (2 mites per plant) was made 2
   weeks after spraying the acaricide. The population of T. urticae was
   maintained at low levels (<= 2.8 mites/leaflet) for 8 weeks (evaluation
   period). The T. urticae infestations in plots with N. californicus were
   significantly lower than in non-release plots, for the experiments 1
   and 2. In the third experiment, the initial infestation of T. urticae
   was 40.5 mites per leaflet (55.5 active stages/leaflet on release
   plants; 25.5 active stages/leaflet on non-release plants). Three
   releases of N. californicus (average rate of 3.0 adult mites/plant),
   without any acaricide application, were not sufficient to reduce
   significantly the T. urticae population in release plots (release
   plants + non-release plants) in 6 weeks from the first release,
   however, the spider mite population decreased from 55.5 to 7.8 active
   stages per leaflet on release plants, during this period. Interplant
   dispersal of N. californicus was low in this strawberry field with high
   infestation of T. urticae. The studies indicate the viability of the
   use of this strain of N. californicus for the control of T. urticae in
   strawberry fields under greenhouse conditions, especially in
   association with selective acaricides.

AB In this paper, we extend the multi-period mean-variance optimization
   framework to worst-case design with multiple rival return and risk
   scenarios. Our approach involves a min-max algorithm and a multi-period
   mean-variance optimization framework for the stochastic aspects of the
   scenario tree. Multi-period portfolio optimization entails the
   construction of a scenario tree representing a discretised estimate of
   uncertainties and associated probabilities in future stages. The
   expected value of the portfolio return is maximized simultaneously with
   the minimization of its variance. There are two sources of further
   uncertainty that might require a strengthening of the robustness of the
   decision. The first is that some rival uncertainty scenarios may be too
   critical to consider in terms of probabilities. The second is that the
   return variance estimate is usually inaccurate and there are different
   rival estimates, or scenarios. In either case, the best decision has
   the additional property that, in terms of risk and return, performance
   is guaranteed in view of all the rival scenarios. The ex-ante
   performance of min-max models is tested using historical data and
   backtesting results are presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Adaptive credit scoring with kernel learning methods
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE risk management; credit scoring; kernel methods; machine learning
ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PATTERNS
AB Credit scoring is a method of modelling potential risk of credit
   applications. Traditionally, logistic regression and discriminant
   analysis are the most widely used approaches to create scoring models
   in the industry. However, these methods are associated with quite a few
   limitations, such as being instable with high-dimensional data and
   small sample size, intensive variable selection effort and incapability
   of efficiently handling non-linear features. Most importantly, based on
   these algorithms, it is difficult to automate the modelling process and
   when population changes occur, the static models usually fail to adapt
   and may need to be rebuilt from scratch. In the last few years, the
   kernel learning approach has been investigated to solve these problems.
   However, the existing applications of this type of methods (in
   particular the SVM) in credit scoring have all focused on the batch
   model and did not address the important problem of how to update the
   scoring model on-line. This paper presents a novel and practical
   adaptive scoring system based on an incremental kernel method. With
   this approach, the scoring model is adjusted according to an on-line
   update procedure that can always converge to the optimal solution
   without information loss or running into numerical difficulties.
   Non-linear features in the data are automatically included in the model
   through a kernel transformation. This approach does not require any
   variable reduction effort and is also robust for scoring data with a
   large number of attributes and highly unbalanced class distributions.
   Moreover, a new potential kernel function is introduced to further
   improve the predictive performance of the scoring model and a kernel
   attribute ranking technique is used that adds transparency in the final
   model. Experimental studies using real world data sets have
   demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2006

AB In many situations one needs to know which action one should take with
   a customer to yield the greatest response. Typically, estimates of the
   response functions of different actions will be based on the responses
   of customers previously assigned to each action. Often, however, the
   previous assignments will not have been random, so that estimates of
   the response functions will be biased. We examine the case of two
   possible actions. We look at the error arising from using the simple
   OLS estimate ignoring the selection bias, and also explore the
   possibility of using the Heckman model to allow for the sample
   selectivity. The performance of Heckman's model is then compared with
   the simple OLS through simulation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Despite the indisputable and well-known advantages of general
   anesthesia in thoracic surgery, this can trigger some adverse effects
   including an increased risk of pneumonia, impaired cardiac performance,
   neuromuscular problems, mechanical ventilation -induced injuries, which
   include barotrauma, volotrauma, atelectrauma, and biotrauma. In order
   to reduce the adverse effects of general. anesthesia, thoracic epidural
   anesthesia has been recently employed to perform awake thoracic surgery
   procedures including coronary artery bypass, management of
   pneumothorax, resection of pulmonary nodules and solitary metastases,
   lung volume reduction surgery, and even transsternal thymectomy. The
   results achieved in this early series have been encouraging, although
   indications and many pathophysiologic aspects remain to be elucidated.
   In this review we have tried to provide a first-step analysis of the
   anecdotal reports available in the literature on this topic. We also
   desired to provide insights into the main physiologic effects of awake
   thoracic surgery with epidural anesthesia, with particular attention to
   the several issues raised by its application in patients with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease, which can represent one of the most
   stimulating challenges in this setting. (c) 2007 European Association

TI Effects of unstable links on AODV performance in real testbeds
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
LA English
DT Article
AB A link between a pair of nodes is defined unstable if it is
   characterized by a packet loss which is not negligible in one or both
   directions. The presence of unstable links in multihop ad hoc networks
   is very likely and it depends on several factors (e.g., different
   transmission capabilities of the devices, interferences caused by
   additional wireless devices). Their management by the routing protocols
   is of paramount importance since they negatively affect applications
   performance. In our previous experimental studies, we found that AODV
   is characterized by very low performance in some specific situations
   and, in this work, we demonstrate that it mainly depends on the wrong
   management of unstable links as valid routes. We present some policies
   that have been proposed in literature to avoid this problem, and we
   validate two of them through experimental results, exploiting also a
   direct comparison with the proactive routing protocol OLSR. Our results
   show that AODV is not able to avoid the use of unstable links, even
   when an alternative stable route exists. In the same conditions, OLSR
   outperforms AODV by correctly managing unstable links. In fact, it is
   able to guarantee a higher packet delivery ratio to the application by
   using the most stable path to reach the destination. Copyright (c) 2007

TI Rate-based active queue management for TCP flows over wired and
   wireless networks
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGORITHM; STABILITY; MODEL
AB Current active queue management (AQM) and TCP protocol are designed and
   tuned to work well on wired networks where packet loss is mainly due to
   network congestion. In wireless networks, however, communication links
   suffer from significant transmission bit errors and handoff failures.
   As a result, the performance of TCP flows is significantly degraded. To
   mitigate this problem, we analyze existing AQM schemes and propose a
   rate-based exponential AQM (REAQM) scheme. The proposed REAQM scheme
   uses the input rate as a primary metric and queue length as the
   secondary metric. The objectives of REAQM are to stabilize networks
   with low packet loss, low packet delay, and high link utilization
   regardless the dynamic of network conditions. We prove the global
   asymptotic stability of the equilibrium based on Lyapunov theory.
   Simulation results suggest that REAQM is capable of performing well for
   TCP flows over both wired and wireless networks, and has comparable
   implementation complexity as other AQM schemes.

AB Impaired water quality caused by human activity and the spread of
   invasive plant and animal species has been identified as a major factor
   of degradation of coastal ecosystems in the tropics. The main goal of
   this study was to evaluate the performance of AnnAGNPS (Annualized
   Non-Point Source Pollution Model), in simulating runoff and soil
   erosion in a 48 km(2) watershed located on the Island of Kauai, Hawaii.
   The model was calibrated and validated using 2 years of observed stream
   flow and sediment load data. Alternative scenarios of spatial rainfall
   distribution and canopy interception were evaluated. Monthly runoff
   volumes predicted by AnnAGNPS compared well with the measured data (R-2
   = 0.90, P < 0.05); however, up to 60% difference between the actual and
   simulated runoff were observed during the driest months (May and July).
   Prediction of daily runoff was less accurate (R-2 = 0.55, P < 0.05).
   Predicted and observed sediment yield on a daily basis was poorly
   correlated (R-2 = 0.5, P < 0.05). For the events of small magnitude,
   the model generally overestimated sediment yield, while the opposite
   was true for larger events. Total monthly sediment yield varied within
   50% of the observed values, except for May 2004. Among the input
   parameters the model was most sensitive to the values of ground residue
   cover and canopy cover. It was found that approximately one third of
   the watershed area had low sediment yield (0-1 t ha(-1) Y-1), and
   presented limited erosion threat. However, 5% of the area had sediment
   yields in excess of 5 t ha(-1) y(-1). Overall, the model performed
   reasonably well, and it can be used as a management too] on tropical
   watersheds to estimate and compare sediment loads, and identify "hot
   spots" on the landscape. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Models are essential in a decision support system for river basin
   management. In a decision support system for integrated planning and
   management, the use of appropriate models is important to avoid models
   being either too simple or too complex. In this paper, appropriate
   models refer to models that are good-enough-but-not-more-than-that to
   obtain an acceptable ranking of river engineering measures under
   uncertainty. A systematic approach called 'appropriateness framework'
   is proposed to determine appropriate models that can be used in a
   decision support system. The approach is applied to a decision support
   system for the Dutch Meuse River. One important component of this
   decision support system, flood safety, is used in this paper to
   demonstrate how this approach works. The results show that the approach
   is very useful in helping to determine appropriate models. Potential
   applications of the approach in other decision support systems are
   discussed. The approach presented in this paper is designed as a tool
   to stimulate the communication between decision makers and modelers and
   to promote the use of models in decision-making for river basin
   management. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Output sharing in partnerships as a common pool resource management
   instrument
SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
LA English

DE common pool resources; partners and strangers; experimental economics;
   collective action; natural resource management
AB Many economic environments are susceptible to either free-riding or
   overuse. Common pool resources (CPRs) fall in the latter category.
   Equally sharing the output of a CPR in partnerships introduces a
   free-riding incentive that may offset overuse. Socially optimal
   harvesting can be induced by dividing the set of resource users into a
   number of partnerships in such a way that each resource users' tendency
   to over-harvest from the resource is exactly offset by his or her
   tendency to free-ride on the contributions of others. We conduct a
   laboratory experiment to assess the performance of this partnership
   solution by introducing equal-sharing subgroups of size one, four and
   six into a twelve-person CPR environment. Group assignment is either
   unchanging throughout a 15 period session or randomly mixed each
   decision round. Group size significantly affects aggregate effort,
   while group assignment makes no significant difference. The
   distribution of total payoffs is more equitable for randomly mixed
   groups. Implications of our results for voluntary and centralized
   implementations of the partnership solution are discussed.

AB The management of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the current status of
   world energy resources crisis are important problems. Gasification is a
   kind of waste-to- energy conversion scheme that offers the most
   attractive solution to both waste disposal and energy problems. In this
   study, the thermodynamic equilibrium model based on equilibrium
   constant for predicting the composition of producer gas in a downdraft
   waste gasifier was developed. To enhance the performance of the model,
   further modification was made by multiplying the equilibrium constants
   with coefficients. The modified model was validated with the data
   reported by different researchers. MSW in Thailand was then used to
   simulate and to study the effects of moisture content (MC) of the waste
   on the gasifier's performance. The results showed that the mole
   fraction of H-2 gradually increases; CO decreases; CH4, which has a
   very low percentage in the producer gas increases; N-2 slightly
   decreases; and CO2 increases with increasing MC. The reaction
   temperature, the calorific value, and the second law efficiency,
   decrease when MC increases. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The achievement of energy efficiency in commercial buildings is a
   function of the activities undertaken, the technology in place, and the
   extent to which those technologies are used efficiently. We study the
   factors that affect efficient energy use, in the Canadian commercial
   sector by applying a stochastic frontier approach to a cross-section of
   Canadian commercial buildings included in the Commercial and
   Institutional Building Energy Use Survey (CIBEUS). Structural and
   climate-control features of the buildings as well as climatic
   conditions are assumed to determine the location of the frontier, while
   management-related variables including such factors as ownership type
   and activities govern whether or not the maximally attainable
   efficiency along the frontier is achieved. Our results indicate that
   although, on average, buildings appear to be fairly efficient, certain
   types of operations are more likely than others to exhibit energy
   efficiencies that are significantly worse than average. These results,
   along with those related to the effects of physical characteristics on
   the stochastic efficiency frontier, suggest that there is scope for
   focused policy initiatives to increase energy efficiency in this
   sector. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the major concerns of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) inside a
   proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is water management.
   Treatment of the pores of the GDL can affect the PEMFC performance due
   to the degree of water flooding inside the GDL. In this work, GDL
   flooding was investigated using a simplified approach in an established
   numerical model. The predictions are compared with experimental data of
   GDLs with different treatments. Local distributions inside the cell are
   given and the effect of homogenous GDL flooding on these is discussed.

AB There are numerous case studies around the world describing integrated
   conservation and development projects (ICDPs). Recently some localized
   syntheses have been published that use sophisticated statistics to
   identify patterns and causal linkages, but no attempt has yet been made
   to draw together lessons from across the globe. This paper is an
   attempt to provide a framework for such an analysis. A set of lessons
   is proposed for improving the prospects of ICDPs by giving
   consideration to each of the five capitals: natural, social, human,
   built, and financial. The language of ICDPs has been adopted by
   development agencies of all persuasions. There is now some urgency to
   identify the characteristics of the environment and the community in
   which success is most likely. This paper is intended as a step in that
   direction.

AB In this study we attempt to evaluate the stock value of Greek firms,
   which apply systems of environmental management in the light of
   systemic risk. Risk is examined empirically with the help of
   conditional volatility models of investment in environmental friendly
   firms. The empirical analysis relies on financial econometric models,
   which deter-mine the underlying conditional volatility. We find that
   improved environmental management system and environmental performance
   result in reductions in firms' beta. Specifically, our empirical
   estimates show evidence of volatility clustering, short- and long-run
   persistence of shocks to the returns of the market and asymmetry in the
   leverage effect between negative and positive shocks to returns.
   Finally, the macroeconomic factors proposed and included in the
   analysis have no statistical significant influence on the beta
   estimates in almost all cases. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Expected loss-based alarm threshold set for earthquake early warning
   systems
SO EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS

DE earthquake early warning; real-time seismology; loss assessment;
   performance-based earthquake engineering
ID GROUND MOTIONS
AB Earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) seem to have potential as tools
   for real-time seismic risk management and mitigation. In fact, although
   the evacuation of buildings requires warning time not available in many
   urbanized areas threatened by seismic hazard, they may still be used
   for the real-time protection of critical facilities using automatic
   systems in order to reduce the losses subsequent to a catastrophic
   event. This is possible due to the real-time seismology, which consists
   of methods and procedures for the rapid estimation of earthquake
   features, as magnitude and location, based on measurements made on the
   first seconds of the P-waves. An earthquake engineering application of
   earthquake early warning (EEW) may be intended as a system able to
   issue the alarm, if some recorded parameter exceeds a given threshold,
   to activate risk mitigation actions before the quake strikes at a site
   of interest. Feasibility analysis and design of such EEWS require the
   assessment of the expected loss reduction due to the security action
   and set of the alarm threshold. In this paper a procedure to carry out
   these tasks in the performance-based earthquake engineering
   probabilistic framework is proposed. A merely illustrative example
   refers to a simple structure assumed to be a classroom. Structural
   damage and non-structural collapses are considered; the security action
   is to shelter occupants below the desks. The cost due to a false alarm
   is assumed to be related to the interruption of didactic activities.
   Results show how the comparison of the expected losses, for the
   alarm-issuance and non-issuance cases, allows Setting the alarm
   threshold on a quantitative and consistent basis, and how it may be a
   tool for the design of engineering applications of EEW. Copyright (c)

   ANALYSIS; RISK
AB Humam papillomavirus is the commonest genital viral infection in
   healthy sexually active subjects, and the presence of chronic or
   persistent HPV types in genital cells may constitute a prognostic
   marker of underlying, or predict future HPV-associated diseases. A
   variety of novel tests for detecting the presence of oncogenic HPV
   types in biological specimens have been reported. These are based on
   the various stages of infection and viral life cycle. HPV infects
   squamous epithelium with expression of various gene products intimately
   linked to epithelial cell differentiation. Hence, there are basically
   three classes of detectable markers directly derived from HPVs:
   molecular markers based on detection of nucleic acid sequences,
   serological markers based on detection of antibodies against viral
   proteins, and cellular markers based on detection of proteins expressed
   intracellularly, upon either infection or carcinogenesis. The nature of
   various assays and the development of international standard reagents
   for qualitative and quantitative assessment of assay performance are
   outlined. There is an increasing demand to develop standard tools to
   assess the quality of HPV detection systems, for regulatory and
   clinical management purposes. International standard reagents for HPV
   will help defining the analytical sensitivity and specificity of
   various detection methods, and will allow assuring that laboratory
   services used to evaluate disease burden, HPV vaccines, and cancer
   prevention strategies are accurate and comparable worldwide. The
   advancement of prophylactic vaccine candidates against HPV infections
   and related diseases stresses the increasing importance of HPV assays
   in monitoring the impact of HPV vaccination on disease burden.

AB In the southern Great Plains, dryland double-cropping soybean [Glycine
   max (L.) Merr] after winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) could provide
   quality summer forage, partially offset mineral fertilizer N applied to
   winter wheat, and lessen soil erosion. Waiting for wheat grain to
   mature, however, delays soybean planting and subjects growth to dry and
   hot conditions. Planting soybean after a hay crop of wheat investigated
   to determine the feasibility of the system as a source of livestock
   feeds and N uptake by both crops. Twelve treatment com-112 kg N ha(-1))
   and six summer management treatments (fallow: conventional and no-till;
   soybean: grazed, cut for hay, green manure, and mulch) were arranged in
   strips across four replications. Soybean biomass ranged from 1.35 to
   from 129 to 220 g kg(-1) resulting in a 3-yr average uptake of 44 kg
   ha(-1). Within each N fertilizer level, average wheat forage yields
   were not different, but yield increased 29% with N fertilizer and crude
   protein was inversely related to yield.,Double-cropped soybean failed
   to offer any yield-enhancing N benefit to wheat or enhance soil N and C
   content after 3 yr, even when used. as a green manure. Unless a
   producer is willing to accept the low productivity of soybean as a
   double crop with wheat, the feasibility of this dryland double-crop
   forage system is limited.

AB This paper analyses the effect of the Spanish privatisation process on
   the performance and corporate governance of the firms that were
   privatised through public offerings over the 1985-2003 period. Using
   conventional pre- versus post-privatisation comparisons, we do not find
   significant improvements in privatised firms' profitability and
   efficiency. However, our results do suggest a change in firms'
   ownership structure and in the characteristics of Boards of Directors
   after privatisation. Firms' ownership concentration decreases as a
   consequence of the relinquishment of control by the State and the
   Boards of Directors are restructured with the creation of new
   specialised committees and the incorporation of more executives.

DT Article
DE board composition; nationality diversity; gender diversity; directors'
   characteristics
ID STRATEGIC CHANGE; WOMEN DIRECTORS; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; GOVERNANCE; TEAM;
   OWNERSHIP; RESOURCE; IMPACT; AGENCY
AB For a sample of 210 Swiss publicly listed firms we analyse the
   characteristics of all 1678 directors in the year 2003 in order to
   investigate how board members' nationality and gender interact with
   directors' level of independence, number of other directorships and
   demographic characteristics. Our results suggest that whereas foreign
   directors tend to be more independent, women directors are more likely
   to be affiliated to firm management through family ties and that
   foreign directors hold significantly lower numbers of directorships at
   other Swiss boards. Female and foreign directors also differ in terms
   of educational background, educational level, age and board tenure.
   Some of our gender diversity findings are different from previous
   research. We conclude that in order to manage diversity on corporate
   boards it is imperative to understand the characteristics,
   qualifications and affiliations that these directors bring to the
   boardroom and that it is important to take national circumstances into
   account rather than relying on research results from other countries.

AB In this paper we use panel data methodology to examine the relationship
   between ownership structure, discretionary accruals and the
   informativeness of earnings for a sample of Spanish non-financial
   companies listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange during the period
   1999-2002. We find a non-linear relationship between insider ownership
   and discretionary accruals and between insider ownership and earnings
   explanatory power for returns. This supports the hypothesis that
   insider ownership contributes both to the informativeness of earnings
   and to constraining earnings management when the proportion of shares
   held by insiders is not too high. When insiders own a large percentage
   of shares, however, they are entrenched and the relation between
   insider ownership, discretionary accruals and earnings informativeness
   reverses.

AB Pay Without Performance: The Unfilled Promise of Executive Compensation
   by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried (Harvard University Press, 2004)
   challenges the view that executive remuneration arrangements are
   designed to maximise shareholder value. The authors argue that
   managerial power results in remuneration being structured to benefit
   executives at the expense of shareholders. This paper contends that
   Bebchuk and Fried's approach illustrates issues that contribute to the
   problematic nature of executive remuneration research. In particular,
   it is proposed that a priori conceptions about executive remuneration,
   methodological dogmatism in research approaches and a significant gap
   between theory and practice, each contribute to the lack of convergence
   in executive pay research. Illustrative data taken from interview-based
   research conducted with Australian non-executive directors supports the
   view that reliance on economic efficiency arguments alone does not
   provide a sufficient framework to explain the subjective, judgemental
   and socially interactive processes involved in determining executive
   pay.

AB The effects of task conflict on group effectiveness are far from
   conclusive. In order to further clarify this relationship, a
   contingency approach has been suggested. In this context, the present
   study examines the roles of group potency and information and
   communication technologies (ICTs) in the relationship between task
   conflict and team effectiveness. The study involved 44 groups of 4
   members each, working in two communication media. Twenty-two groups
   worked in a face-to-face condition, and the other 22 groups worked in a
   computer-mediated communication condition. The groups developed a
   project during four weekly sessions over a one-month period. The
   results showed that group potency moderated the relationship between
   task conflict and group effectiveness. However, the communication
   medium did not play a moderator role in these relationships. (C) 2006

AB This study establishes a framework for backward design analyses and
   cross-functional performance management system to achieve product
   design for excellence. The authors define backward design as opposed to
   regular forward design. A cross-functional viewpoint emphasizing
   downstream knowledge and lessons learned is introduced for proactive
   product design management. The study proposes several approaches for
   backward design endeavors, including Extended Failure Mode and Effect
   Analysis (EFMEA), Attributes Function Deployment (AFD), Feedback
   Tracking and Analysis System (FeTAS), Fuzzy Decision Tree, etc. Based
   on the backward design concerns, a cross-functional design management
   system is then established to serve as an incentive system for designer
   to incorporate cross-functional concerns. The contributions include:
   (1) Proposing backward design mechanisms; (2) Establishing a
   cross-functional design management system which is conducive to design
   for excellence. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper develops a balanced scorecard for supply chain management
   (SCM) that measures and evaluates day-to-day business operations from
   following four perspectives: finance, customer, internal business
   process, and learning and growth. Balanced scorecard has been developed
   based on extensive review of literature on SCM performance measures,
   supported by three case studies, each illustrating ways in which BSC
   was developed and applied in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)
   in India. The paper further suggests that a balanced SCM scorecard can
   be the foundation for a strategic SCM system provided that certain
   development guidelines are properly followed, appropriate metrics are
   evaluated, and key implementation obstacles are overcome. The balanced
   scorecard developed in this paper provides a useful guidance for the
   practical managers in evaluation and measuring of SCM in a balanced way
   and proposes a balanced performance measurement system to map and
   analyze supply chains. While suggesting balanced scorecard, different
   SCM performance metrics have been reviewed and distributed into four
   perspectives. This helps managers to evaluate SCM performance in a
   much-balanced way from all angles of business. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The production scheduling problem allocates limited resources to tasks
   over time and determines the sequence of operations so that the
   constraints of the system are met and the performance criteria are
   optimized. One approach to this problem is the use of artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) stand alone or in conjunction with other methods.
   Artificial neural networks are computational structures that implement
   simplified models of biological processes, and are preferred for their
   robustness, massive parallelism, and learning ability. In this paper,
   we give a comprehensive overview on ANN approaches for solution of
   production scheduling problems, discuss both theoretical developments
   and practical experiences, and identify research trends. More than 50
   major production and operations management journals published in years
   1988-2005 have been reviewed. Existing approaches are classified into
   four groups, and additionally a historical progression in this field
   was emphasized. Finally, recommendations for future research are
   suggested in this paper. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE FMIPv6; IP multicast; mobility management; performance evaluation;

ID CHALLENGES
AB This paper elaborates on seamless handover support for wireless IP
   multicast networks with the use of a novel mobility management
   mechanism. The latter enables mobile nodes with active multicast
   sessions to execute seamless remote subscriptions while changing their
   network attachment point and is formulated by extending the unicast
   "Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6" protocol (FMIPv6). The proposed scheme
   minimizes service disruption due to handover, by using conditional
   tunneling of multicast traffic on a per flow (rather than per mobile
   node) basis. Moreover, a simple buffering technique is proposed,
   enabling the temporary storage of the tunneled before the handover
   packets thus eliminating packet loss occurring during the link layer
   handover period. Also, multicast traffic recipients experience reduced
   handover latency due to the timely configuration of the network routers
   providing the multicast service. The performance of the proposed
   mechanism is evaluated by OPNET simulation results, for realistic IEEE
   802.11 WLAN indoor simulation scenarios, incorporating spatially
   correlated shadowing for the propagation environment and random
   mobility of users. Performance results are provided in terms of service
   disruption time perceived by video streaming recipients as well as
   tunneling and buffering overhead for handover support, while varying
   the FMIPv6 protocol triggering configuration, the inter-domain distance
   and the access router buffering capacity. The performance evaluation
   reveals a significant reduction in the handover packet loss level when
   compared to similar multicast mobility schemes, causing a slight
   increase of resource consumption for tunneling and buffering purposes.

AB This paper investigates the problem of survivable traffic grooming
   (STG) in shared mesh optical networks and proposes different frameworks
   for improving the survivability of low speed demands against multiple
   near simultaneous failures. Spare capacity reprovisioning has recently
   been considered for improving the overall network restorability in the
   event of dual failures; here, after the recovery form the first
   failure, some connections in the network may become unprotected and
   exposed to new failures. Capacity reprovisioning then allocates
   protection resources to unprotected and vulnerable connections so that
   the network can withstand a future failure. In this paper, we propose
   two different reprovisioning schemes (lightpath level reprovisioning,
   LLR, and connection level reprovisioning, CLR); they differ in the
   granularity at which protection resources are reprovisioned. Further,
   each of these schemes is suitable for a different survivable grooming
   policy. While LLR provides collective reprovisioning of connections at
   the lightpath level, CLR reprovisions spare bandwidth for lower speed
   connections instead. We use simulation methods to study the performance
   of these schemes under two grooming policies (PAL and PAC), and we show
   that while CLR reprovisions substantially many more connections than
   LLR (i.e., potentially more management overhead) CLR yields a much
   better network robustness to simultaneous failures due to its superior
   flexibility in using network resources. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This paper introduces a utility-based radio resource management
   technique in multicell wireless packet networks. In terms of allocation
   of base station (BS) downlink transmit power and assignment of resource
   to users in each cell, we formulate a problem of maximizing system
   utility which is defined as the sum of cell utilities. The problem,
   however, is not solvable due to its non-convex property. Thus, we
   propose a heuristic algorithm based on an intuition obtained from
   analyzing a simple two-cell problem. Though the heuristic approach also
   incurs signaling overhead for power coordination between neighboring
   base stations, it is much less than that of the original approach.
   Simulation results show the performance of our proposed algorithm
   compared with two competitive schemes: optimal and maximum power
   allocation schemes. As expected, the optimal allocation scheme shows
   the best performance but can not be employed in a real network due to
   intractable complexity. Our heuristic algorithm performs reasonably
   well with very low complexity. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Of the various radio resource management functions, in this paper we
   focus on call admission control (CAC). We propose a CAC scheme for
   multiservice High Altitude Platform (HAP) wideband code division
   multiple access (W-CDMA) cellular systems that caters for multimedia
   services. HAPs have known increasing popularity during the past few
   years and are expected to play a pivotal role in the telecommunications
   arena by virtue of their appealing features. We first study the uplink
   capacity of a multiservice HAP W-CDMA cellular system taking into
   consideration power control imperfections and evaluate the degradation
   that a new call induces in the quality of service of ongoing calls.
   Based on the obtained statistics, we then develop a CAC scheme that
   takes account of power control imperfections and user mobility and
   compare it to a CAC scheme that is based on instantaneous energy per
   bit to noise power spectral density ratio (E-b/N-0) measurements.
   Additionally, we examine these algorithms for two different criteria
   that apply to both new and handoff call requests. The first criterion
   is based on the minimum E-b/N-0 of the first tier cells, while the
   second bases its decision upon the mean E-b/N-0 of the cells of the
   first tier. Simulation studies further document and confirm the
   positive characteristics of the proposed CAC scheme. (c) 2007 Elsevier

AB As mobile ad hoc network (MANET) systems research has matured and
   several testbeds have been built to study MANETs, research has focused
   on developing new MANET applications such as collaborative games,
   collaborative computing, messaging systems, distributed security
   schemes, MANET middleware, peer-to-peer file sharing systems, voting
   systems, resource management and discovery, vehicular computing and
   collaborative education systems. The growing set of diverse
   applications developed for MANETs pose far more complex traffic
   patterns than the simple one-to-one traffic pattern, and hence the
   one-to-one traffic pattern widely used in previous protocol studies has
   become inadequate in reflecting the relative performance of these
   protocols when deployed to support these emerging applications.
   As a first step towards effectively supporting newly developed and
   future diverse MANET applications, this paper studies the performance
   impact of diverse traffic patterns on routing protocols in MANETs.
   Specifically, we propose a new communication model that extends the
   previous communication model to include a more general traffic pattern
   that varies the number of connections per source node. We study the
   performance impact of traffic patterns on various routing protocols via
   detailed simulations of an ad hoc network of 112 mobile nodes. Our
   simulation results show that many of the conclusions drawn in previous
   protocol comparison studies no longer hold under the new traffic
   patterns. These results motivate the need for performance evaluation of
   ad hoc networks to not only include rich and diverse mobility models as
   has been done in the past but also include diverse traffic patterns
   that stress a wide set of protocol design issues. (c) 2007 Elsevier

TI Performance analysis of TCP/AQM with generalized AIMD under
   intermediate buffer sizes
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE congestion control; buffer sizing; active queue management;
   discrete-time stochastic models; performance analysis
AB For TCP/AQM systems, the issue of buffer sizing has recently received
   much attention. The classical rule-of-thumb suggests O(N) buffer size
   to ensure full link utilization when N TCP flows share a bottleneck
   link of capacity O(N), while recent empirical study shows the buffer of
   size O(root N) is enough to yield high utilization (say, 95%) for large
   N. However, these results are all limited to the drop-tail scheme and
   there has been no systematic modeling framework for any buffer sizing
   between O(root N) and O(N). In this paper, we study the limiting
   behavior of a TCP/AQM system for an intermediate buffer sizing of
   O(N-gamma) (0.5 <= gamma < 1). We develop a stochastic model in a
   discrete-time setting to characterize the system dynamics and then show
   that we can have 100% link utilization and zero packet loss probability
   for a large number of flows when the buffer size is chosen anywhere
   between O(root N) and O(N). Our model is general enough to cover any
   queue-based AQM scheme with ECN marking (including the drop-tail) and
   various generalized AIMD (additive-increase-multiplicative-decrease)
   algorithms for each TCP flow. We also provide arguments showing that
   the discrete-time based modeling can effectively capture all the
   essential system dynamics under our choice of scaling (0.5 <= gamma <
   1) for buffer size as well as AQM parameters. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI Hepatitis B virus and HIV coinfection: Results of a survey on treatment
   practices and recommendations for therapy
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID CO-INFECTED PATIENTS; CONSENSUS CONFERENCE; VIRAL-HEPATITIS;
   MANAGEMENT; CARE
AB Background. The management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection is challenged by the selection
   of patients for therapy, options for antiviral medications, and
   inconsistency in published treatment guidelines.
   Methods. A survey was sent to 161 sites in a multicenter HIV clinical
   trials group to assess HBV screening, criteria for initiation of
   therapy, and treatment choices for patients coinfected with HBV and HIV.
   Results. Of 161 sites, 78 completed the survey (response rate, 48.4%).
   Of these sites, 98.7% screened for HBV infection, 86% vaccinated
   HIV-infected patients who were not immune to HBV infection, and 79%
   made treatment decisions without referral to a hepatologist or
   gastroenterologist. Treatment recommendations varied; 42% of the sites
   initiated therapy when patients' levels of alanine aminotransferase and
   aspartate aminotransferase were elevated and HBV DNA level was > 10(5)
   copies/mL, whereas 49% of the sites initiated therapy in the presence
   of any detectable HBV DNA level. Antiviral treatment choices for
   patients who were not concurrently receiving antiretroviral therapy
   were lamivudine plus tenofovir, adefovir, or interferon. Patients
   concurrently receiving antiretroviral therapy received lamivudine plus
   tenofovir preferentially, followed by tenofovir plus emtricitabine,
   adefovir, or interferon. Ninety-one percent of the sites screened for
   hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Conclusions. The majority of HIV-infected patients were screened and
   vaccinated for HBV infection and underwent surveillance for
   hepatocellular carcinoma. Decisions regarding the performance of liver
   biopsy, threshold to initiate therapy, and criteria to discontinue
   therapy varied, reflecting inconsistencies in available treatment
   guidelines. Treatment decisions reflected concerns regarding future
   drug resistance in patients who are naive to antiretroviral therapy and
   the emergence of drug resistance in patients receiving antiretroviral
   therapy.

AB The aim of this paper is to improve understanding of the adaptive
   capacity of European agriculture to climate change. Extensive data on
   farm characteristics of individual farms from the Farm Accountancy Data
   Network (FADN) have been combined with climatic and socio-economic data
   to analyze the influence of climate and management on crop yields and
   income and to identify factors that determine adaptive capacity. A
   multilevel analysis was performed to account for regional differences
   in the studied relationships. Our results suggest that socio-economic
   conditions and farm characteristics should be considered when analyzing
   effects of climate conditions on farm yields and income. Next to
   climate, input intensity, economic size and the type of land use were
   identified as important factors influencing spatial variability in crop
   yields and income. Generally, crop yields and income are increasing
   with farm size and farm intensity. However, effects differed among
   crops and high crop yields were not always related to high incomes,
   suggesting that impacts of climate and management differ by impact
   variable. As farm characteristics influence climate impacts on crop
   yields and income, they are good indicators of adaptive capacity at
   farm level and should be considered in impact assessment models.
   Different farm types with different management strategies will adapt
   differently.

   METHODS. Patients with CUP received carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL a minute
   intra venously Day 1, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) intravenously Days 1 and
   8, and capecitabine 1600 mg/m2 orally in divided doses, Days 1-14 of a
   21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles. The primary endpoint of the study was
   objective response rate by intent-to-treat analysis.
   RESULTS. Thirty-three patients were treated (median age, 58 years;
   men:women ratio, 19:14). Most patients had a baseline performance
   status of 1. The objective response rate was 39.4% (95% CI,
   22.9%-57.9%) in all patients, 36.4% in 22 patients with well to
   moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and 40.0% in 20 patients with
   liver metastases. Median progression -free survival time was 6.2 months
   (95% Cl, 5.4%-8.01/0), and median survival time was 7.6 months (95% CI,
   6.3-14.1). One and 2-year survival rates were 35.6% and 14.2%,
   respectively. The most frequent grade >= 3 adverse events were
   neutropenia (67%), thrombocytopenia (48%), and anemia (33%).
   CONCLUSIONS. The combination of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and
   capecitabine is active in CUP, especially in patients with liver
   metastases. This regimen may be a potential therapy for CUP patients
   with good performance status, particularly those with a suspected
   origin below the diaphragm.

AB BACKGROUND. The purpose was to evaluate the prognostic factors and
   treatment outcome of Indian patients with primary diffuse large B-cell
   lymphoma (DLBCL) of the tonsil treated at a single institution.
   METHODS. In all, 121 patients with DLBCL of the tonsil, treated at the
   Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India, from January 1990 to December
   2002, were included. The median age was 45 years and the majority of
   patients (68%) were males. Systemic symptoms were present in 12% of
   patients; 28% presented with stage I and 67% had stage 11 disease.
   Treatment consisted of a combination of chemotherapy (CTh) and
   radiotherapy (RT) for the majority of patients (69.4%). Among those
   receiving RT, 64% received an RT dose of >= 45 Gy.
   RESULTS. After a median follow-up of 62 months, disease-free survival
   (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 66.4% and 81.6%, respectively.
   Significant prognostic factors included: WHO performance score >= 2
   (OS: 72.1% vs 95.6%, P =.016), bulky tumors (OS: 68.5% vs 86.9%, P
   =.001), presence of B-symptoms (OS: 36.7% vs 79.6%, P <.001), and Ann
   Arbor stage. On multivariate analysis; WHO performance score >= 2
   (hazard ratio [HR], 4.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-15.12),
   and B symptoms (HR, 6.27; 95% CI, 2.38-16.48), retained statistical
   significance. CTh + RT resulted in a significantly better outcome than
   those treated with CTh alone (OS: 85.7% vs 70.7%, P =.008). The
   complete response (P =.053), DFS (P =.039), and OS (P =.014) rates were
   significantly better for patients receiving an RT dose >= 45 Gy.
   CONCLUSIONS. Tumor bulk, WHO performance score, the presence of B
   symptoms, and Ann Arbor stage significantly influence Outcome. A
   combined modality treatment, consisting of CTh and RT (with an RT dose
   of >= 45 Gy), results in a satisfactory outcome in patients with this
   uncommon neoplasm.

AB Problem Irrigated agriculture exposes rural people to health risks
   associated with vector-borne diseases and pesticides used in
   agriculture and for public health protection. Most developing countries
   lack collaboration between the agricultural and health sectors to
   jointly address these problems.
   Approach We present an evaluation of a project that uses the "farmer
   field school" method to teach farmers how to manage vector-borne
   diseases and how to improve rice yields. Teaching farmers about these
   two concepts together is known as "integrated pest and vector
   management".
   Local setting An intersectoral project targeting rice irrigation
   systems in Sri Lanka.
   Relevant changes Project partners developed a new curriculum for the
   field school that included a component on vector-borne diseases. Rice
   farmers in intervention villages who graduated from the field school
   took vector-control actions as well as improving environmental
   sanitation and their personal protection measures against disease
   transmission. They also reduced their use of agricultural pesticides,
   especially insecticides.
   Lessons learned The intervention motivated and enabled rural people to
   take part in vector-management activities and to reduce several
   environmental health risks. There is scope for expanding the curriculum
   to include information on the harmful effects of pesticides on human
   health and to address other public health concerns, Benefits of this
   approach for community-based health programmes have not yet been
   optimally assessed.Also, the institutional basis of the integrated
   management approach needs to be broadened so that people from a wider
   range of organizations take part.A monitoring and evaluation system
   needs to be established to measure the performance of integrated
   management initiatives.

AB The purpose of this review paper is to summarise the wide-range but
   diffuse literature on predominantly permeable pavement systems (PPS),
   highlight current trends in research and industry, and to recommend
   future areas of research and development. The development of PPS as an
   integral part of sustainable drainage systems is reviewed in the
   context of traditional and modern urban drainage. Particular emphasise
   is given to detailed design, maintenance and water quality control
   aspects. The most important target pollutants are hydrocarbons, heavy
   metals and nutrients (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus). The advantages and
   disadvantages of different PPS are discussed with the help of recent
   case studies. The latest innovations are highlighted and explained, and
   their potential for further research work is outlined. Recent research
   on the development of a combined geothermal heating and cooling, water
   treatment, and recycling pavement system is promising. (c) 2006

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

   CONTRACT; STRESS; MODEL
AB Background: The satisfaction and the quality of life perceived by
   professionals have implications for the performance of health
   organizations. We have assessed the variations in professional quality
   of life ( PQL) and their explanatory factors during a services
   management decentralization process.
   Methods: It was designed as a longitudinal analytical observational
   study in a Health Area in Madrid, Spain. Three surveys were sent out
   during an ongoing management decentralization process between 2001 and
   2005. The professionals surveyed were divided into three groups: Group
   I ( 97.3% physicians), group II ( 92.5% nurses) and group III (
   auxiliary personnel). Analysis of the tendency and elaboration of an
   explanatory multivariate model was made. The PQL - 35 questionnaire,
   based on Karasek's demand-control theory, was used to measure PQL. This
   questionnaire recognizes three PQL dimensions: management support (
   MS), workload ( WL) and intrinsic motivation ( IM).
   Results: 1444 responses were analyzed. PQL increased 0.16 ( CI 95% 0.04
   - 0.28) points in each survey. Group II presents over time a higher PQL
   score than group I of 0.38 ( IC 95% 0.18 - 0.59) points. There is no
   difference between groups I and III.
   For each point that MS increases, PQL increases between 0.44 and 0.59
   points. PQL decreases an average of between 0.35 and 0.49 point, for
   each point that WL increases.
   Age appears to have a marginal association with PQL ( CI 95% 0.00 -
   0.02), as it occurs with being single or not having a stable
   relationship ( CI 95% 0.01 - 0.41). Performing management tasks
   currently or in the past is related to poorer PQL perception ( CI 95%
   -0.45 - -0.06), and the same occurs with working other than morning
   shifts ( CI 95% -0.03 - -0.40 points).
   PQL is not related to sex, location of the centre ( rural/urban), time
   spent working in the organization or contractual situation.
   Conclusion: With the improvement in work control and avoiding increases
   in workloads, PQL perception can be maintained despite deep
   organizational changes at the macro-management level. Different
   professional groups experience different perceptions depending on how
   the changes impact their position in the organization.

AB The conservation of Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) populations has
   been one of the most controversial and visible issues in United States
   conservation history. Coincident with declines in Spotted Owl
   populations over the last three decades has been the invasion of Barred
   Owls (Strix varia) throughout the range of the Northern Spotted Owl (S.
   o. caurina) and into the range of the California Spotted Owl (S. o.
   occidentalis). This invasion has confused the reasons behind recent
   Spotted Owl declines because anecdotal and correlative information
   strongly suggests that Barred Owls are a new factor influencing the
   declines. There is great uncertainty about all aspects of the invasion,
   and this has sparked discussion about appropriate management and
   research responses regarding the effects of this invasion on Spotted
   Owls. We present a set of possible responses to address the issue, and
   we discuss the relative merits of these with regard to their efficacy
   given the current state of knowledge. We recommend that research
   specifically aimed at learning more about the interspecific
   relationships of these two owls throughout the range of sympatry should
   begin immediately. Approaches that seem unlikely to be useful in the
   short-term either because they do not facilitate knowledge acquisition,
   are relatively costly, or would be technically less feasible, should
   not be considered viable at this time. We believe the consequences of
   the invasion are potentially dire for the Spotted Owl and that research
   and management actions, including the use of adaptive management, are
   required to inform the near- and long-term decision-making process for
   conservation of Spotted Owls.

AB Cambodia forms part of the Indo-Burma hotspot. Its extent of
   biodiversity, however, is subject to considerable uncertainty, as there
   has been little systematic collection of flora and fauna. During the
   Khmer Rouge regime institutions were banned, academics were prosecuted
   and written documentation systematically destroyed. Compared with
   neighbouring countries Cambodia has a low population density and
   relatively large natural areas that are still intact. However,
   deforestation is expanding rapidly and a significant but un-estimated
   area of forest has been degraded by development of agro-industries,
   encroachment, illegal logging, over-harvesting and forest fire as well
   as the use of chemicals during war. The purpose of the paper is to: (i)
   apply reserve selection methods to design more robust conservation
   networks when knowledge of species occurrence is incomplete and habitat
   is threatened, and (ii) evaluate the usefulness of systematic
   conservation. planning in a developing country where data are limited
   and institutions for implementation are weak. This study investigates
   the performance of four non-probabilistic strategies: (i) a so-called
   'rule of thumb', (ii) hotspot, (iii) minimum cost representation, and
   (iv) maximum coverage; and one probabilistic design strategy, i.e.
   maximum expected coverage. The maximum expected coverage approach is
   between 15% and 24% more efficient than the non-probabilistic
   strategies. Finally, the relevance of such tools to real-world
   conservation planning in Cambodia is investigated. By incorporating
   experts in the generation of data, running the models and setting up
   premises, they acknowledge that it is possible to contribute to more
   systematic conservation planning in developing countries. (C) 2007

AB Diabetic macular edema (DME) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
   associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are the leading
   causes of vision loss in the industrialized world. The mainstay of
   treatment for both conditions has been thermal laser photocoagulation,
   while there have been recent advances in the treatment of CNV using
   photodynamic therapy with verteporfin. While both of these treatments
   have prevented further vision loss in a subset of patients, vision
   improvement is rare. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A
   therapy has revolutionized the treatment of both conditions.
   Pegaptanib, an anti-VEGF aptamer, prevents vision loss in CNV, although
   the performance is similar to that of photodynamic therapy.
   Ranibizumab, an antibody fragment, and bevacizumab, a full-length
   humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, have both shown promising
   results, with improvements in visual acuity in the treatment of both
   diseases. VEGF trap, a modified soluble VEGF receptor analog, binds
   VEGF more tightly than all other anti-VEGF therapies, and has also
   shown promising results in early trials. Other treatment strategies to
   decrease the effect of VEGF have used small interfering RNA to inhibit
   VEGF production and VEGF receptor production. Corticosteroids have
   shown efficacy in controlled trials, including anacortave acetate in
   the treatment and prevention of CNV, and intravitreal triamcinolone
   acetonide and the fluocinolone acetonide implant in the treatment of
   DME. Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as vatalanib, inhibit
   downstream effects of VEGF, and have, been effective in the treatment
   of CNV in early studies. Squalamine lactate inhibits plasma membrane
   ion channels with downstream effects on VEGF, and has shown promising
   results with systemic administration. Initial results are also
   encouraging for other growth factors, including pigment
   epithelium-derived factor administered via an adenoviral vector.
   Ruboxistaurin, which decreases protein kinase C activity, has shown
   positive results in the prevention of diabetic retinopathy progression,
   and the resolution of DME. Combination therapy has been investigated,
   and may prove to be quite effective in the management of both DME and
   AMD-associated CNV, although ongoing and future studies will be crucial
   to treatment optimization for each condition.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK
AB An approach to assessing the environmental outcomes and changes in
   peoples' livelihoods resulting from landscape-scale conservation
   interventions was developed for three locations in Africa. Simple sets
   of performance indicators were developed through participatory
   processes that included a variety of stakeholders. The selection of
   indicators was designed to reflect wider landscape processes,
   conservation objectives and as local peoples' preferred scenarios. This
   framework, combined with the use of social learning techniques, helped
   stakeholders develop greater understandings of landscape system
   dynamics and the linkages between livelihood and conservation
   objectives. Large scale conservation and development interventions
   should use these approaches to explore linkages and improve shared
   understanding of tradeoffs and synergies between livelihood and
   conservation initiatives. Such approaches provide the basis for
   negotiating and measuring the outcomes of conservation initiatives and
   for adapting these to changing perspectives and circumstances.

TI Computerised paediatric asthma quality of life questionnaires in

SO ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; CHILDREN; PARENTS; PERCEPTIONS; CAREGIVERS; HEALTH
AB Background: Asthma quality of life questionnaires are not readily
   incorporated into clinical care. We therefore computerised the
   Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (standardised)
   (PAQLQ(S)) and the Paediatric Asthma Caregivers Quality of Life
   Questionnaire (PACQLQ), with a colour-coded printed graphical report.
   Objectives: To (a) assess the feasibility of the electronic
   questionnaires in clinical care and (b) compare the child's PAQLQ
   scores with the parent's score, physician's clinical score and
   spirometry.
   Methods: Children with asthma were given a clinical severity score of
   1-4 (increasing severity) and then completed the PAQLQ(S)
   electronically (scores 1-7 for increasing quality of life in emotional,
   symptoms and activity limitation domains) followed by spirometry and
   physician review. Parents completed the PACQLQ. Inclusion criteria
   required fluent Hebrew and reliable performance of spirometry. Children
   with additional chronic diseases were excluded. //Results: 147 children
   with asthma aged 7-17 years completed PAQLQs and 115 accompanying
   parents completed PACQLQs, taking 8.3 (4.3-15) and 4.4 (1.5-12.7) min,
   respectively (mean (range)). Graphical reports enabled physicians to
   address quality of life during even brief visits. Children's (PAQLQ)
   and parents' (PACQLQ) total scores correlated (r = 0.61, p<0.001),
   although the children's median emotional score of 6.3 was higher than
   their parents' 5.7 (p<0.001), whereas median activity limitation score
   was lower than their parents': 5.0 and 6.8, respectively (p<0.001). No
   correlation was found with physician's clinical score or spirometry.
   Conclusions: Electronic PAQLQs are easy to use, providing additional
   insight to spirometry and physician's assessment, in routine asthma
   care. Future studies must assess impact on asthma management.

ID SENSED TREE SIZE; CANOPY VOLUME
AB Ultrasonic sensors can be used to estimate tree canopy volume
   variability within orchards, which is useful for planning site-specific
   management practices and estimating crop yield. The objective of this
   study was to investigate the errors in tree canopy volume measured with
   a 10-transducer ultrasonic orchard measurement array and Trimble AgGPS
   132 DGPS. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the magnitude of
   individual errors in ultrasonically-sensed tree canopy volume
   measurement (epsilon (UCV)) caused by several factors including ground
   speed accuracy measured by DGPS, uncalibrated air temperature,
   ultrasonic transducers, and deviation in driving path from the
   centerline between two rows. The height error in the transducer array
   due to improper tire inflation and uneven ground was also estimated.
   Canopy volume of a selected tree measured with the ultrasonic system
   was used as the basis to simulate epsilon (UCV) caused by each error
   factor. One hundred data points were simulated within the selected
   range of each factor to calculate epsilon (UCV) and the ranges were
   determined on the basis of measured data and literature. The overall
   ranking of error sources affecting canopy volume were, from high to low
   1) DGPS ground speed (+/- 6.78%), 2) air temperature (+4.83% to -4.69%
   for the temperature range 5 degrees C to 45 degrees C), 3) ultrasonic
   transducer performance (+/- 2.29%), and 4) deviations in driving path
   (+/- 1.56%). The height error due to uneven ground and wheel tracks
   ranged from 0.025 to 0.12 m. These results could be used to control
   error in ultrasonically-sensed canopy volumes within orchards.

TI Operating room managerial decision-making on the day of surgery with

SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
LA English
DT Article
ID TIME; ANESTHESIA; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; COORDINATION; UNCERTAINTY;
   AUTOMATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; SAFETY
AB Background: There are three basic types of decision aids to facilitate
   operating room (OR) management decision-making on the day of surgery.
   Decision makers can rely on passive status displays (e.g., big screens
   or whiteboards), active status displays (e.g., text pager
   notification), and/or command displays (e.g., text recommendations
   about what to do).
   Methods: Anesthesiologists, OR nurses, and housekeepers were given nine
   simulated scenarios (vignettes) involving multiple ORs to study their
   decision-making. Participants were randomized to one of four groups,
   all with an updated paper OR schedule: with/without command display and
   with/without passive status display.
   Results: Participants making decisions without command displays
   performed no better than random chance in terms of increasing the
   predictability of work hours, reducing over-utilized OR time, and
   increasing OR efficiency. Status displays had no effect on these
   end-points, whereas command displays improved the quality of decisions.
   In the scenarios for which the command displays provided
   recommendations that adversely affected safety, participants
   appropriately ignored advice.
   Conclusions: Anesthesia providers and nursing staff made decisions that
   increased clinical work per unit time in each OR, even when doing so
   resulted in an increase in over-utilized OR time, higher staffing
   costs, unpredictable work hours, and/or mandatory overtime.
   Organizational culture and socialization during clinical training may
   be a cause. Command displays showed promise in mitigating this
   tendency. Additional investigations are in our companion paper.

   maximising utilisation, minimising over-running and minimising

   these. We also applied the formula to 16 consecutive elective surgical

   one at a non-university hospital). Again, the formula gave useful
   insights into problems faced by the teams in improving their
   performance, and it also guided possible solutions. The formula
   confirmed that a team that schedules cases according to the predicted
   durations of the operations listed (i.e. the non-university hospital
   team) suffered fewer cancellations (median 5% vs 8% and 13%) and fewer
   list over-runs (6% vs 38% and 50%), and performed considerably more
   efficiently (90% vs 79% and 72%; p = 0.038) than teams that did not do
   so (i.e. those from the university hospital). We suggest that surgical
   list performance is more completely described by our formula for
   efficiency than it is by other conventional measures such as list
   utilisation or cancellation rate alone.

AB Objective. To assess the effect of simulation- based learning on doctor
   of pharmacy ( PharmD) students' ability to perform accurate blood
   pressure assessments and to measure student satisfaction with this
   novel teaching method.
   Methods. Didactic lectures on blood pressure assessment were combined
   with practical sessions using a high-fidelity computerized patient
   simulator. Before and after the simulation sessions, students completed
   a written objective examination to assess knowledge and completed a
   survey instrument to determine their attitudes regarding the learning
   experience. Individual clinical skills were assessed using the patient
   simulator.
   Results. Ninety- five students completed the study. Significant
   improvement was seen in students' knowledge and their ability to
   accurately determine blood pressure following simulation sessions.
   Survey responses indicated that students felt confident that
   simulation- based learning would improve their ability to perform
   accurate blood pressure assessments.
   Conclusion. Pharmacy students showed significant improvement in
   clinical skills performance and in their knowledge of the
   pharmacotherapy of hypertension. Students expressed high levels of
   satisfaction with this type of learning experience.

TI Functional performance characteristics associated with postponing
   elementary school entry among children with Down syndrome
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
DE Down syndrome; mainstream school; Pediatric Evaluation of Disability
   Inventory (PEDI); pediatrics; school entry
ID SKILLS; KINDERGARTEN; ACQUISITION; PARENTS
AB OBJECTIVES. This study investigated the relation between functional
   performance skills of children with Down syndrome and the age of entry
   into mainstream elementary education.
   METHOD. In a cross-sectional study of 70% of the 7-year-old children
   with Down syndrome in Norway (N= 43), we measured functional
   performance using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory
   (PEDI). The study was a follow-up of a previous study of the same
   children at age 5 assessed using the same instrument. Data from both
   studies were used in the analysis.
   RESULTS. Forty percent of the sample of children with Down syndrome in
   Norway had entered elementary school after a 1-year postponement (i.e.,
   at age 7). The functional performance skills of the children, as
   measured using the PEDI, were significantly lower at both age 5 and age
   7 in self-care and social function compared with children with Down
   syndrome who entered elementary school at the usual time (i.e., at age
   6). The main characteristics associated with postponed elementary
   school entry were found in communication skills and bladder and bowel
   management.
   CONCLUSION. A certain level of development and independence seems to be
   required for a child with Down syndrome to be viewed as ready to enter
   elementary school, and perceptions of readiness for school may be
   culturally dependent. In addition to the well-described challenges in
   language and communication skills, being viewed as ready for school
   includes having stopped using diapers, a topic not previously mentioned
   as a factor in postponing elementary school entry for children with
   Down syndrome. Awareness of culturally influenced performance skills
   may give direction to parents and professionals in targeting areas in
   the preschool years that might help promote these children's readiness
   for school.

TI Improving the use of evidence-based heart failure therapies in the

AB Evidence-based consensus treatment guidelines are available to assist
   physicians with the management of chronic heart failure (HF). Although
   it has been generally presumed that physicians incorporate these
   treatment guidelines into clinical practice, the actual assimilation of
   evidence-based strategies and guidelines has been demonstrated to be
   less than ideal. Studies of HF care show that treatment guidelines are
   slowly adopted and inconsistently applied and, thus, often fail to lead
   to improvements in patient care and outcomes. There are a number of
   ongoing, large, national quality improvement registries that are
   following the clinical care and outcomes of inpatient HF treatment.
   However, to date, there have been no similar quality improvement
   registries in the outpatient arena. The Registry to Improve the Use of
   Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting
   (IMPROVE HF) is the first large, comprehensive performance improvement
   registry designed to characterize the current outpatient management of
   systolic HF and assess the effect of practice-specific process
   improvement interventions consisting of education, specific clinical
   guidelines, reminder systems, benchmarked quality reports, and
   structured academic detailing on the use of evidence-based HF
   therapies. Seven performance measures to quantify the quality of
   outpatient HF care were explicitly developed by the IMPROVE HF Steering
   Committee. The primary objective is to observe, over the aggregate of
   IMPROVE HF practice sites, a relative 20% improvement in at least 2 of
   the 7 performance measures at 24 months, compared with baseline.
   Deidentified clinical data from the medical records of a planned 43 000
   patients from 160 US cardiology practices will be included in this
   study.

   afflicted patients. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
   design-based stereology, and high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) to assess the age-related neuropathology in double transgenic
   mice that overexpress two AD-related proteins-amyloid precursor protein
   (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1)-and age- and gender-matched wild-type (WT)
   controls. In mice ranging in age from 4-28 months, total volumes of the
   hippocampal formation (V-HF) and whole brain (V-brain) were quantified
   by the Cavalieri-point counting method on a systematic-random sample of
   coronal T2-weighted MRI images; the same stereological methods were
   used to quantify V-HF and V-brain after perfusion and histological
   processing. To assess changes in AD-type beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques,
   sections from the hippocampal formation and amylgdaloid complex of mice
   aged 5, 12, and 15 months were stained by Congo Red histochemistry. In
   aged mice with large numbers of amyloid plaques, systematic-random
   samples of sections were stained by GFAP immunocytochemistry to assess
   gender and genotype effects on total numbers of astrocytes. In
   addition, levels of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), serotonin
   (5-HT) and 5-HT metabolites were assayed by HPLC in fresh-frozen
   samples from neocortex, striatum, hippocampus, and brainstem. We
   confirmed age-related increases in amyloid plaques, beginning with a
   few plaques at 5 months of age and increasing densities by 12 and 15
   months. At 15 months of age, there were robust genotype effects, but no
   gender effects, on GFAP-immunopositive astrocytes in the amygdaloid
   complex and hippocampus. There were no effects on monoamine levels in
   all brain regions examined, and no volume changes in hippocampal
   formation or whole brain as quantified on either neuroimages or tissue
   sections. Strong correlations were present between volume estimates
   from MRI images and histological sections, with about 85% reduction in
   mean V-HF or mean V-brain between MRI and processed histological
   sections. In summary, these findings show that the double transgenic
   expression of AD-type mutations is associated with age-related
   increases in amyloid plaques and astrocytosis; however, this model does
   not recapitulate the cortical atrophy or neurochemical changes that are
   characteristic of AD.

AB Conclusion. Having found a prevalence rate of alternobaric vertigo in
   Portuguese Air Force pilots that is somewhat higher than previously
   reported, we underline the importance of implementing education on the
   management of this condition as part of routine Air Force pilot
   training programs. Objectives. Alternobaric vertigo is a condition in
   which transient vertigo with spatial disorientation occurs suddenly
   during flying or diving activities, caused by bilateral asymmetrical
   changes in middle ear pressure. Its prevalence is very likely
   underestimated and under-reported, with the 10-17% prevalence rate
   mentioned in early literature not being challenged by recent data.
   Subjects and methods. To assess its actual prevalence, the authors
   requested all high performance aircraft pilots presently on active duty
   in the Portuguese Air Force to anonymously answer a questionnaire on
   alternobaric vertigo symptoms, after a short briefing on the subject.
   Results. A 29% prevalence rate of in-flight episodes consistent with
   alternobaric vertigo was obtained.

AB Throughout the life cycle of biopharmaceutical products, bioanalytical
   support is provided using ligand binding assays to measure the drug
   product for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity
   studies. The specificity and selectivity of these ligand binding assays
   are highly dependent on the ligand binding reagents. Thus the
   selection, characterization, and management processes for ligand
   binding reagents are crucial to successful assay development and
   application. This report describes process considerations for selection
   and characterization of ligand binding reagents that are integral parts
   of the different phases of assay development. Changes in expression,
   purification, modification, and storage of the ligand binding re agents
   may have a profound effect on the ligand binding assay performance.
   Thus long-term management of the critical ligand binding assay reagents
   is addressed including suggested characterization criteria that allow
   ligand binding reagents to be used in as consistent a manner as
   possible. Examples of challenges related to the selection,
   modification, and characterization of ligand binding reagents are
   included.

TI Fertility monitoring in dairy herds

   interval; controll charts
ID PERFORMANCE
AB An important factor for the economy of dairy herds is their performance
   in reproduction. To achieve acceptable results, a fertility monitoring
   system is introduced in the present study. Using data of electronical
   dairy herd management programs, the system normally analyses one single
   control parameter. For this purpose, the fraction of repeat-breeding
   days of all production days was calculated. This variable merges both,
   the economically important parameter calving inter-Val and the cows
   getting more than one insemination without gestation and are
   slaughtered afterwards because of infertility. This variable was
   calculated for one dairy farm and analysed with control charts. So far,
   the use of control charts is very common in the industry, but the
   application of these charts in monitoring biological processes is rare.
   The great advantage of those charts is the classification of the
   process variation into unavoidable random variation and special
   variation because of preventable causes. In the present study, two
   different charts are introduced: the CUSUM and the EWMA chart. The
   borderline for random process variation is passed in both charts for
   the analysed farm. To find the reasons for this trespassing, the
   variables percent of repeat-breeder cows and time between inseminations
   were analysed. For the contemplated dairy herd both charts detected the
   increasing quota of repeat-breeder cows as reason for the growth of the
   fraction of repeat-breeding days of all production days.
   Overall, control charts and the variable fraction of repeat-breeding
   days of all production days seem to give a satisfactory overview about
   the herd performance. A monitoring system containing these two
   components could be a good tool for the herd manager and complete the
   appraisals of his electronical dairy herd management program.

AB In future, organizations will find fewer young employees and will have
   to employ more older (50plus) employees. However, many organizations
   are not well prepared to face the corresponding risks and chances.
   After an introductory glance at the known facts concerning demographic
   change in Germany and the often ignored problem of age discrimination
   in the work place, recent results regarding the learning and
   performance potential of older employees are summarized. This analysis
   reveals that the very low percentage of older employees in Germany has
   several reasons and cannot be explained solely by pointing to
   age-related decreases in performance capabilities of aging individuals.
   Therefore, human resource management is called upon to act against age
   discrimination in organizations and to establish more incentives for
   long-term employment. Further, other strategies which lead to the
   maintenance of innovation and work performance of aging employees and
   can assist in better utilization of potentials of these employees are
   discussed. Special attention is given to recent findings concerning age
   diversity in teams. Continued training, leadership, and age
   differentiated work design are discussed as further important areas of
   human resource management for organizations with an aging work force.

TI Comparative evaluation of life cycle assessment models for solid waste
   management
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This publication compares a selection of six different models developed
   in Europe and America by research organisations, industry associations
   and governmental institutions. The comparison of the models reveals the
   variations in the results and the differences in the conclusions of an
   LCA study done with these models. The models are compared by modelling
   a specific case - the waste management system of Dresden, Germany -
   with each model and an in-detail comparison of the life cycle inventory
   results. Moreover, a life cycle impact assessment shows if the LCA
   results of each model allows for comparable and consecutive
   conclusions, which do not contradict the conclusions derived from the
   other models' results. Furthermore, the influence of different level of
   detail in the life cycle inventory of the life cycle assessment is
   demonstrated.
   The model comparison revealed that the variations in the LCA results
   calculated by the models for the case show high variations and are not
   negligible. In some cases the high variations in results lead to
   contradictory conclusions concerning the environmental performance of
   the waste management processes. The static, linear modelling approach
   chosen by all models analysed is inappropriate for reflecting actual
   conditions. Moreover, it was found that although the models' approach
   to LCA is comparable on a general level, the level of detail
   implemented in the software tools is very different. (c) 2007 Elsevier

TI Classifying pupils by where they live: How well does this predict
   variations in their GCSE results?
SO URBAN STUDIES

ID SCHOOLS
AB This paper summarises key findings resulting from the appending of the
   neighbourhood classification system Mosaic to the records of the Pupil
   Level Annual School Census (PLASC) within the National Pupil Database
   (NPD) of the Department for Education and Skills (DfES). The most
   significant of these findings is that, other than the performance of
   the pupil at an earlier Key Stage test, the type of neighbourhood in
   which a pupil lives is a more reliable predictor of a pupil's GCSE
   performance than any other information held about that pupil on the
   PLASC database. Analysis then shows the extent to which the performance
   of pupils from any particular type of neighbourhood is also
   incrementally affected by the neighbourhoods from which the other
   pupils in the school they attend are drawn. It finds that whilst a
   pupil's exam performance is affected primarily by the social background
   of people he or she may encounter at home, the social background of
   fellow school pupils is of only marginally lower significance. These
   findings suggest that so long as pupils' GCSE performances are so
   strongly affected by the type of neighbourhood in which they live, a
   school's league position bears only indirect relationship to the
   quality of school management and teaching. A better measurement of the
   latter would be a league table system which took into account the
   geodemographic profile of each school's pupil intake. The paper
   concludes with discussion of the relevance of these findings to the
   sociology of education, to the debate on consumer choice in public
   services, to the general appropriateness of adjusting public-sector
   performance metrics to take into account the social mix of service
   users and to parental strategies in the educational sector in
   particular.

AB Watershed models are powerful tools for simulating the effect of
   watershed processes and management on soil and water resources.
   However, no comprehensive guidance is available to facilitate model
   evaluation in terms of the accuracy of simulated data compared to
   measured flow and constituent values. Thus, the objectives of this
   research were to: (1) determine recommended model evaluation techniques
   (statistical and graphical), (2) review reported ranges of values and
   corresponding performance ratings for the recommended statistics, and
   (3) establish guidelines for model evaluation based on the review
   results and project-specific considerations; all of these objectives
   focus on simulation of streamflow and transport of sediment and
   nutrients. These objectives were achieved with a thorough review of
   relevant literature on model application and recommended model
   evaluation methods. Based on this analysis, we recommend that three
   quantitative statistics, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias
   (PBIAS), and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard
   deviation of measured data (RSR), in addition to the graphical
   techniques, be used in model evaluation. The following model evaluation
   performance ratings were established for each recommended statistic. In
   general, model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if NSE > 0.50
   and RSR <= 0.70, and if PBIAS +/- 25% for streamflow, PBIAS +/- 55% for
   sediment, and PBIAS +/- 70% for N and P. For PBIAS,
   constituent-specific performance ratings were determined based on
   uncertainty of measured data. Additional considerations related to
   model evaluation guidelines are also discussed. These considerations
   include: single-event simulation, quality and quantity of measured
   data, model calibration procedure, evaluation time step, and project
   scope and magnitude. A case study illustrating the application of the
   model evaluation guidelines is also provided.

AB Growing urbanization has led to increasing concern and emphasis on
   better construction site stormwater management. The objectives of this
   study were to determine the effectiveness of using compost rather than
   conventional hydroseeding or topsoil to reduce erosion from disturbed
   soils. The runoff rates, interrill erosion rates, and interrill
   erodibility factors from five compost and two control treatments
   (hydroseeding and topsoil) were compared. Compost treatments followed
   Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) specifications for compost
   applied as an erosion control at 1.3 and 5 cm depths. Rainfall
   simulation was used to apply a storm of 92 mm h(-1). Surface runoff was
   collected after 5 min of rainfall (first flush) and during the last 30
   min of rainfall (steady-state). The first flush mean runoff from the 5
   cm depth general-use compost treatment was significantly higher than
   that of all other treatments. The other treatments (50% woodchips and
   50% compost blend at 1.3 and 5 cm depths) and hydroseeding had
   significantly lower runoff and erosion rates compared to topsoil and
   compost manufactured topsoil at first flush and steady-state.
   Furthermore, there were no performance differences between 1.3 and 5 cm
   compost applications at first flush or steady-state. The TxDOT
   specification for erosion control compost depth might be able to be
   reduced from 5 to 1.3 cm.

AB It is generally assumed that databases have to reside in external.
   inexpensive storage because of their sheer size. Current technology for
   external storage systems presents us with a reality that,
   performance-wise, a small number of sequential scans of the data is
   strictly preferable over random data accesses. Database technology - in
   particular query processing technology has developed around a notion of
   memory hierarchies with layers of greatly varying sizes and access
   times. It seems that the current technologies scale up to their tasks
   and are very successful, but on closer investigation it may appear that
   our theoretical understanding of the problems involved - and of optimal
   algorithms for these problems - is not quite as developed.
   Recently. data stream processing has become an object of study by the
   database management community, but from the viewpoint of database
   theory. this is really a special case of the query processing problem
   on data in external storage where we are limited to a single scan of
   the input data.
   In the present paper we study a clean machine model for external memory
   and stream processing. We establish tight bounds for the data
   complexity of Core XPath evaluation and filtering. We show that the
   number of scans of the external data induces a strict hierarchy (as
   long as internal memory space is sufficiently small, e.g.,
   polylogarithmic in the size of the input). We also show that neither
   joins nor sorting are feasible if the product of the number r (n) of
   scans of the external memory and the size s (n) of the internal memory
   buffers is sufficiently small, i.e., of size o(n). (C) 2007 Published

   HEALTH
AB Background: Stress can impact student performance. Yet few medical
   schools provide students with a consistent opportunity to develop and
   regularly practice stress-reduction techniques to aid them
   academically. Description: A curriculum component designed to assist 64
   postbaccalaureate minority students in developing and practicing a
   stress-management technique was implemented on a regular basis from
   June 2004 to April 2006. Students participated in Deep Breathing
   Meditation exercises in two classes and completed pre-, post-, and
   follow-lip surveys each academic year. Evaluation: Students reported
   having perceptions of decreased test anxiety, nervousness, self doubt,
   and concentration loss, using the technique outside of the two classes,
   and believing it helped them academically and would help them as a
   physician. Conclusions: The Deep Breathing Meditation technique was
   successfully implemented each academic year, and it provided students
   with a promising solution for meeting challenging academic and
   professional situations.

TI Complementary theories to supply chain management
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Review
DE supply chain management; product development
ID RESOURCE-BASED-VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; MASS CUSTOMIZATION;
   TRANSACTION COST; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT;
   POSTPONEMENT; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE
AB Purpose - The paper seeks to discuss and develop SCM as a scientific
   discipline using different theories from non-logistics areas to explain
   interorganizational phenomena. it also attempts to establish a frame of
   reference that allows us to mitigate the gap between the current SCM
   research and practice and the theoretical explanations of how to
   structure and manage supply chains.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper introduces three different
   perspectives that together will contribute to a broader understanding
   of SCM in practice: an economic perspective; a socio-economic
   perspective; and a strategic perspective. The theoretical framework is
   applied to two important research topics within SCM: third party
   logistics (TPL); and new product development (NPD).
   Findings - There is no such thing as "a unified theory of SCM".
   Depending on the concrete situation, one can choose one theory as the
   dominant explanatory theory, and then complement it with one or several
   of the other theoretical perspectives.
   Research limitations/implications - The way the four theories
   complement one another is explored on a conceptual basis, but further
   research into this direction may explore more deeply how these alleged
   complementarities occur in practice, and how managers mould their
   decisions by these ideas.
   Practical implications - The four theories can provide normative
   support to important management decisions in supply chains, such as
   outsourcing, safeguards against opportunism, and alignment of
   incentives.
   Originality/value - The main contribution is that one cannot rely on
   one theoretical explanation when analyzing phenomena in SCM. It is
   neccessary to consider several theories and how they may complement one
   another in order to provide a more comprehensive view of SCM.

TI Performance measurement in agri-food supply chains: a case study
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE food industry; supply chain management; performance measurement
   (quality); case study
AB Purpose - Measurement of the performance of entire supply chains is an
   important issue because it allows for "tracking and tracing" of
   efficacy and efficiency failures and leads to more informed decision
   making with regard to chain design. However, the choice of appropriate
   supply chain performance indicators is rather complicated due to the
   presence of multiple inputs and multiple outputs in the system.
   Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the usefulness of a novel
   conceptual model for supply chain performance measurement in an
   agri-food supply chain.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model for integrated supply
   chain performance measurement is evaluated in a Dutch-German tomato
   supply chain by means of a case study approach.
   Findings - The proposed conceptual framework is found to be useful for
   measuring performance of the tomato supply chain. From the case study
   it is concluded that four main categories of performance measures (i.e.
   efficiency, flexibility, responsiveness, and food quality) are
   identified as key performance components of the tomato supply chain
   performance measurement system.
   Originality/value - This research evaluates a novel concept for
   measuring the performance of agri-food supply chains. This concept is
   the first step in developing an integrated performance measurement
   system that contains financial as well as non-financial indicators
   combined with the specific characteristics of agri-food supply chains.
   Based on a case study in the tomato supply chain, this concept is found
   to have potential.

AB The silicon industry is facing unprecedented problems in power
   management, particularly static power, while the demand for increased
   performance remains unabated. It is likely that techniques at every
   level, from architectural changes to materials advances, will be
   required to mitigate these problems. Engineering the electronic
   properties of the silicon channel, while preserving the integrity of
   the silicon-silica interface, offers considerable benefits of reduced

AB Scientific research and practical applications of solar physics require
   data and computational services to be integrated seamlessly and
   efficiently. The European Grid for Solar Observations (EGSO) leverages
   Grid-oriented concepts and technology to provide a high-performance
   infrastructure for solar applications. In this paper, an architecture
   for a data brokerage service is proposed. Brokers interact with
   providers and consumers in order to build a profile of both parties. In
   particular, a broker interacts with providers in order to gather
   information on the data potentially available to consumers, and with
   the consumers in order to identify the set of providers that are most
   likely to satisfy specific data needs. The brokerage technique is based
   on a multi-tier management of metadata. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley &

AB There are several decisions in investment management process. Security
   selection is the most time-consurning stage. Tatical allocation is in
   order to take advantage of market opportunities based on short-term
   prediction (Amenc and Le Sourd in Portfolio theory and performance
   analysis. Wiley, 2003). Although it is difficult to keep track of the
   fluctuations of volatile financial markets, the capacity of artificial
   intelligence to perform spatial search and obtain feasible solutions
   has led to its recent widespread adoption in the resolution of
   financial problems. Classifier systems possess a dynamic learning
   mechanism, they can be used to constantly explore environmental
   conditions, and immediately provide appropriate decisions via
   self-aware learning. This study consequently employs a classifier
   system in conjunction with real number encoding to investigate how to
   obtain optimal stock portfolio based on investor adjustment cycle. We
   examine the constituents of the TSEC Taiwan 50 Index taking moving
   average (MA), stochastic indicators (KD), moving averaae convergence
   divergence (MACD), relative strength index (RSI) and Williams %R (WMS
   %R) as input factors, adopting investor-determined adjustment cycle to
   allocate capital, and then constructing stock portfolio. We have
   conducted empirical testing using weekly and monthly adjustment cycle;
   the results revealed that this study's decision-making assistance model
   yields average annual interest rate of 49.35%, which is significantly
   better than the -6.59% of a random purchase model. This research
   indicates that a classifier system can effectively monitor market
   fluctuations and help investors obtain relatively optimal returns. The
   assistance model proposed in this study thus can provide really helpful
   decision-making information to investors.

AB From the viewpoint of internal marketing, employees who are content in
   their job may be motivated to satisfy their customers better than ones
   who are not content. Another relevant premise is that the content
   employees, because of their work motivation, would eventually help
   improve the performance of their firm. To verify these relationships,
   some previous studies looked into the effects of organisational service
   orientation on employee's satisfaction. But only few of them
   investigated the mediating effects of variables such as service value
   and customer orientation for their role in linking service orientation
   to business performance. This study examines how an organisation's
   service orientation had an effect on its performance at hospitals. For
   this purpose, verification of the mediating role of service value
   perceived by employees as well as the role of customer orientation on
   the firm's performance was attempted. For this study, a total of 292
   usable questionnaires were collected from hospital staffs located in
   metropolitan cities of Korea. The hypotheses concerning relationships
   among service orientation, service value, employee satisfaction and
   customer orientation were verified by covariance structural modelling,
   using SPSS 10.0 and AMOS 4.0 programs. The result is as follows. First,
   organisational service orientation had a positive effect on both
   employee satisfaction and service value perceived by hospital staff.
   Second, employee satisfaction had a positive impact on service value
   and customer orientation. Finally, service value as well as employee's
   customer orientation were found to exert positive influence on the
   medical firm's performance.

TI Mutual fund performance and persistence in Taiwan: A non-parametric
   approach
SO SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID EFFICIENCY; MANAGEMENT; FLOWS
AB This paper applies data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure the
   performance of Taiwan domestic equity funds during the period 1999 to
   2003. To test performance persistence, we first divide the sample funds
   into low efficiency (0-25th percentile), middle efficiency (26th-75th
   percentile), and high efficiency (76th-100th percentile) groups
   according to their rankings on technical efficiency (TE) and Sharpe
   ratios, respectively. Then, based on the previous one-, two-, and
   three- year performances of the sample funds, we employ iterative
   seemingly unrelated regressions to analyse the persistence of sample
   fund performance. The results show that there exists a significant 'hot
   hands' effect in Taiwan domestic equity funds under the TE measure, but
   not under the measure of Sharpe ratios. The paper concludes that the
   different results in performance persistence analyses between the above
   two measures is driven by the DEA taking transaction costs into
   consideration.

AB Using panel data for the period 1999-2003, this study shows that
   internal and external financing are not perfect substitutes, not
   corroborating the theorem of Modigliani and Miller. Portuguese service
   industries prefer internal to external financing, corroborating Pecking
   Order theory. The bigger the size of the company, the greater the level
   of debt, corroborating Trade-Off and Signalling theories. The negative
   relationship between the amount of fixed capital and debt corroborates
   Agency theory. The results allow us to conclude that debt contributes
   to improving management efficiency, agency problems between
   shareholders and creditors having little relevance.

AB This paper develops a knowledge perspective on value creation in
   organisations that employ mediating technology to facilitate
   inter-customer relations. Mediators, individually and collectively,
   build networks of customers between whom linking can take place, and
   they provide services that facilitate inter-customer exchanges. Earlier
   research has shown the importance of size and standardisation in
   mediation. A different stream of research has shown that contextual
   knowledge is important for problem solving and innovation in
   organisations. Combining theories of mediating technology and situated
   problem solving, the paper posits that inter-customer relations
   constitute the fundamental context for value creation of firms using
   the mediating technology. LISREL is used to test relationship-level,
   cross-sectional hypotheses that link knowledge of inter-customer
   relationships, added value, and customer commitment to bank services
   for small firms. This work extends Thompson's work on mediating
   technology with implications for organisation action by demonstrating
   that mediators' knowledge of inter- customer relationships is an
   important resource in intermediation. Three contributions are made to
   strategic management and organisation theory. First, the paper provides
   a deeper understanding of the relationship between knowledge and
   committed customers. Second, fundamental resources are developed for
   firms using mediating technology. Finally, the use of the situated
   knowledge concept is extended to inter-customer relations, thus
   explaining performance beyond the contexts to which the concept has
   previously been applied. The findings have implications for
   segmentation practices, organisation domain decisions and the
   corresponding organisational

TI A systems approach to service development in a concurrent engineering

SO SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL

ID FINANCIAL SERVICES; KEY CONCEPTS; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION;
   PRODUCTS; SUCCESS
AB If a service organisation is to ensure continuous growth, long- term
   profitability, and ongoing competitiveness, it needs to develop new
   services to attract and satisfy customers. Service development is thus
   a key challenge for any service organisation. Such service development
   requires a continuous process that begins with an innovative idea and
   continues until the new service is introduced to the market. The
   process involves the planning of systems and processes, the allocation
   of resources, a process of quality design, the creation of
   prerequisites, and the ultimate realisation of the original idea.
   Quality is the most important prerequisite for satisfying customers and
   ensuring the competitiveness of a service organisation. To guarantee
   service quality, all phases of the service-development process must be
   optimised. The present paper develops a framework for a systems
   approach to service development in a concurrent engineering
   environment. The framework consists of several key design stages: (i)
   process design; (ii) quality design; (iii) production-management
   design; (iv) capacity design; (v) management design; and (vi) physical
   and technical design. These designs are integrated and conducted
   systematically in the implementation of the project to raise the
   overall performance of the new service. A case study is presented to
   illustrate the implementation process. The case study demonstrates that
   this integrated and systematic approach is a powerful and useful tool
   for new service development.

TI Profiling citation impact: A new methodology
SO SCIENTOMETRICS
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; NATIONS
AB A methodology for creating bibliometric impact profiles is described.
   The advantages of such profiles as a management tool to supplement the
   reporting power of traditional average impact metrics are discussed.
   The impact profile for the UK as a whole reveals the extent to which
   the median and modal UK impact values differ from and are significantly
   below average impact. Only one-third of UK output for 1995-2004 is
   above world average impact although the UK's average world-normalised
   impact is 1.24.
   Time-categorised impact profiles are used to test hypotheses about
   changing impact and confirm that the increase in average UK impact is
   due to real improvement rather than a reduction in low impact outputs.
   The impact profile methodology has been applied across disciplines as
   well as years and is shown to work well in all subject categories. It
   reveals substantial variations in performance between disciplines. The
   value of calculating the profile median and mode as well as the average
   impact are demonstrated. Finally, the methodology is applied to a
   specific data-set to compare the impact profile of the elite Laboratory
   of Molecular Biology (Cambridge) with the relevant UK average. This
   demonstrates an application of the methodology by identifying where the
   institute's exceptional performance is located.
   The value of impact profiles lies in their role as an interpretive aid
   for non-specialists, not as a technical transformation of the data for
   scientometricians.

AB This article studies organizational assessment in complex
   sociotechnical systems. There is a practical need to monitor,
   anticipate and manage the safety and effectiveness of these systems. A
   failure to do so has resulted in various organizational accidents. Many
   theories of accidents and safety in industrial organizations are either
   based on a static and rational model of an organization or they are
   non-contextual. They are thus reactive in their search for errors and
   analysis of previous accidents and incidents, or they are disconnected
   from the actual work in the organization by their focus on general
   safety attitudes and values. A more proactive and predictive approach
   is needed, that is based on an accurate view on an organization and the
   demands of the work in question. This article presents and elaborates
   four statements: (1) the current models of safety management are
   largely based on either a rational or a non-contextual image of an
   organization, (2) complex sociotechnical systems are socially
   constructed and dynamic cultures, (3) in order to be able to assess
   complex sociotechnical systems an understanding of the organizational
   core task is required, and (4) effectiveness and safety depend on the
   cultural conceptions of the organizational core task. Finally, we will
   discuss the implications of the proposed concepts for safety research
   and development work in complex sociotechnical systems. (c) 2006

AB Objectives. - During the past few years, multislice computed tomography
   coronary angiography has made great progress in terms of spatial and
   temporal resolution. Results on detection and quantification of
   stenoses are excellent. We found interesting reporting its achievements
   in aneurismal coronaropathies such as the Kawasaki disease.
   Methods, - We searched for young adults with Kawasaki disease who had a
   multislice computed tomography coronary angiography available. Several
   hospitals in the Paris area have been contacted and only two
   observations have been kept.
   Results. - Computed tomography provided higher performance than
   coronarography for the measurement of the real diameter of an aneurism
   taking into account the mural thrombus, evaluation of its links with
   the collateral branches and the other aneurisms, assessment of the
   development of recanalized vessels and the degree of development of
   collateral vessels, and visualization of non-circulating aneurisms
   which were not detected with coronary angiography. In addition, the
   evaluation of the location and the degree of the stenoses by the
   computed tomography matched the coronary angiography data. It was not
   possible to conclude with this observations that the computed
   tomography is better for the diagnostic of Kawasaki disease.
   Conclusion. - Multislice computed tomography coronary angiography will
   be likely more and more used to detect and follow coronary anomalies in
   case of Kawasaki disease among teenagers and young adults. It is
   recommended for monitoring medium or large aneurisms in order to
   evaluate their progression to stenosis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Purpose: To determine the performance of two person CPR on an
   instrumented manikin by registered nurses using conventional bag valve
   mask (BVM) ventilation or the Impact Model 730 automatic transport
   ventilator (Impact 730, Impact Instrumentation, Inc., West Caldwell,
   NJ) in CPR mode using a face mask.
   Design: Randomized crossover quasi-experimental.
   Setting: Laboratory simulation.
   Subjects: Twenty-eight registered nurses trained in performing adult
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
   Interventions: Basic Life Support was provided by subjects using a
   conventional bag valve mask (BVM) ventilation or mask ventilation with
   an automatic transport ventilator, the Impact 730, which incorporates a
   metronome to facilitate chest compression timing. Subjects alternated
   performing 4 min of CPR using the BVM or Impact 730 to deliver breaths
   with a mask while the other subject performed compressions.
   Measurements and main results: Flow, volume and pressure were measured
   using a pneumotachograph and pressure transducer, and ease of use was
   measured using a 10cm visual analogue scale. There was no statistical
   or clinical difference between the actual and recommended tidal lung
   volume (mean +/- S.D.) delivered by the Impact 730 (-120.4 +/- 91.5 mt)
   versus the 137.7 +/- (-119.8 +/- 187.3 ml). Ventilation with the BVM
   resulted in more (137.7 +/- 143.9 mt) air per breath passing through
   the simulated lower esophageal sphincter compared to the Impact 730
   (14.0 +/- 16.8 mt, p < 0.05). The reduced mask leak per breath with the
   Impact 730 (176.1 +/- 98.3ml) compared to the BVM (367.6 +/- 337.7 mt,
   p < 0.05) is likely to have resulted from the subject being able to
   manage the mask with two rather than one hand and is reflected in the
   higher ease of use score on a 10 cm visual analogue scale with the
   Impact 730 (8.06 +/- 1.35 cm) versus the BVM (6.46 +/- 2.46 cm, p <
   0.05). Subjects tended to deliver slightly more compressions and
   breaths when using the BVM.
   Conclusion: Compared to the BVM, the Impact 730 is as effective, easier
   to use and limits the amount of gas entering the stomach when used
   during adult CPR in a simulated setting. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Purpose: Personal protection equipment (PPE) is recommended for use
   during airway management of patients with highly contagious respiratory
   tract illness. While its use in chemical hazards and its effect on
   airway management has been assessed previously, there has been no
   research assessing whether this equipment affects the ability to
   perform tracheal intubation. It is the intention of this investigation
   to answer this question.
   Methods: Eighteen workers at various level of training were asked to
   wear three different types of PPE while performing four different types
   of tracheal, intubation. The PPE used included the eye shield, face
   shield and the "Dustmaster (TM)". The intubation techniques were direct
   laryngoscopy, intubation through the intubating laryngeal mask(Fastrach
   (TM)) and flexible bronchoscopy using the eyepiece and an eyepiece with
   camera attached. We assessed the time to intubate as well as the
   incidence of oesophageal intubation. A short questionnaire was used to
   examine participants' subjective experiences of wearing the various
   types of PPE.
   Results: There was no significant effect on the time to intubation for
   any of the methods studied. However, all subjects found that the face
   shield was uncomfortably hot to wear. Fibreoptic bronchoscopic
   intubation using the eyepiece was particularly difficult with all of
   the PPE used due to the distance of the subjects' eye from the eyepiece.

AB The Chief Technology Officer position has been adopted by a wide
   variety of industries that are seeking to leverage technology within
   products and services. The position calls for an operational executive
   who can make important strategic decisions that impact the competitive
   position of the company. However, little research has been done to
   define the CTO's responsibilities, methods of evaluating the person's
   performance, and the skills that he or she should bring to the office.
   This paper identifies five dominant patterns of the CTO position,
   labeled the Genius, Administrator, Director, Executive, and Advocate.
   These patterns are useful in understanding the diversity within the
   position and in matching a CTO from a specific pattern to a business
   with unique issues to be addressed.

ID PERFORMANCE; ROLES
AB 2007 is Research-Technology Management's 50th year of publication. To
   mark the occasion, each issue reprints one of RTM's six most frequently
   referenced articles. The articles were identified by N. Thongpapanl and
   Jonathan D. Linton in their 2004 study of technology innovation
   management journals, a citation-based study in which RTM ranked third
   out of 25 specialty journals in that field (see RTM, May-June 2004, pp.
   5-6). The article reprinted here was originally published in 1988 and
   has been updated with its author's reflections." It surveys what had
   been learned about the management of human resources during the
   previous 50 years since the Industrial Research Institute's founding in
   1938. The focus is on the effective utilization of technical
   professionals, which the author breaks into four "distinct, yet,
   interrelated components or sub-systems": an effective human resource
   planning, reward, performance appraisal, and career planning system.
   After discussing the major research findings and lessons for each
   element, the article concludes with a research agenda for the next 50
   years.

AB The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, the most common form of
   secondary hypertension, is based on clinical and biochemical features.
   Although radiology plays no role in the initial diagnosis, it has an
   important role in differentiating between the two main causes of
   primary aldosteronism: aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and
   bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). This distinction is important
   because APAs are generally managed surgically and BAH medically.
   Adrenal venous sampling is considered the standard of reference for
   determining the cause of primary aldosteronism but is technically
   demanding, operator dependent, costly, and time consuming, with a low
   but significant complication rate. Other imaging modalities, including
   computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and adrenal
   scintigraphy, have also been used to determine the cause of primary
   aldosteronism. Cross-sectional imaging has traditionally focused on
   establishing the diagnosis of an APA, with that of BAH being one of
   exclusion. A high specificity for detecting an APA is desirable, since
   it will avert unnecessary surgery in patients with BAH. However, an
   overreliance on cross-sectional imaging can lead to the incorrect
   treatment of affected patients, mainly due to the wide variation in the
   reported diagnostic performance of these modalities. A combination of
   modalities is usually required to confidently determine the cause of
   primary aldosteronism. The quest for optimal radiologic management of
   primary aldosteronism continues just over a half century since this
   disease entity was first described.

AB The origin of specific insect genotypes that enable efficient use of
   agricultural plants is an important subject not only in applied fields
   like pest control and management but also in basic disciplines like
   evolutionary biology. Conventionally, it has been presupposed that such
   pest-related ecological traits are attributed to genes encoded in the
   insect genomes. Here, however, we report that pest status of an insect
   is principally determined by symbiont genotype rather than by insect
   genotype. A pest stinkbug species, Megacopta punctatissima, performed
   well on crop legumes, while a closely related non-pest species,
   Megacopta cribraria, suffered low egg hatch rate on the plants. When
   their obligate gut symbiotic bacteria were experimentally exchanged
   between the species, their performance on the crop legumes was,
   strikingly, completely reversed: the pest species suffered low egg
   hatch rate, whereas the non-pest species restored normal egg hatch rate
   and showed good performance. The low egg hatch rates were attributed to
   nymphal mortality before or upon hatching, which were associated with
   the symbiont from the non-pest stinkbug irrespective of the host insect
   species. Our finding sheds new light on the evolutionary origin of
   insect pests, potentially leading to novel approaches to pest control
   and management.

AB Enterprise processes, i.e. business and manufacturing, rely on
   enterprise modelling and simulation tools to assess the quality of
   their structure and performance in an unobtrusive and cost-effective
   way. Each of these processes is a collaboration of inseparable elements
   such as resources, information, operations, and organization. In order
   to provide a more complete assessment of enterprise processes, a
   simulation approach that allows communication and interaction among
   these elements needs to be provided. The simulation approach requires
   an analysis of the performance of each element and its influence on
   other elements in an object-oriented way. It also needs to have the
   capability to represent the structures and dynamics of the elements
   mentioned, and to present the performance assessment comprehensively.
   This will ensure a more holistic simulation modelling task.
   These simulation requirements have motivated the investigation of the
   novel integration of two popular enterprise process modelling methods:
   Cimosa and high-level coloured Petri net. The Cimosa framework is used
   to formalize the enterprise modelling procedure in the aspects of
   representing process elements, structure, behaviours, and
   relationships. The high-level coloured Petri nets method provides the
   mechanism to simulate the dynamics of objects and their
   characteristics, and also to enable communication among the objects.
   The approach is applied on a postal process model, which involves
   elements from manufacturing processes, i.e. machine processing
   (sorting), inventory (storage), product flow, and resource planning.
   Simulation studies based on the hierarchical dispatching rules show
   that the integrated approach is able to present vital information
   regarding the communication method, resource management, and the effect
   of interactions among these manufacturing process elements, which are
   not provided by the current modelling system in the postal company. The
   current paper has presented a novel mechanism, i.e. Cimosa-HCTSPN
   modelling approach, to extract information on process elements and
   their interactions. It has also presented the novel hierarchical
   dispatching rules and contributed to the extension of information that
   can be represented for a postal process.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of
   Queensland Police Service's version of COMPSTAT, known as "Operational
   Performance Reviews" (OPRs), on reported crime.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper employed interrupted time
   series analytic techniques to examine the impact of OPRs on various
   categories of reported crime in Queensland. The analyses assessed the
   extent to which OPRs were associated with crime reductions across the
   29 police districts in Queensland.
   Findings - The introduction of OPRs was found to be associated with a
   significant decrease in the total number of reported offences in
   Queensland. OPRs were found to have their strongest effect on reported
   unlawful entries into dwellings and unlawful entries into other
   proper-ties. The overall finding was that OPRs appeared to be a
   cost-effective approach to controlling crime, resulting in an overall
   saving of AUD$1,162,175.
   Practical implications - The current study suggests that COMPSTAT
   generally - and Queensland's OPRs in particular - can be an effective
   police management mechanism, which results in observable reductions in
   reported crimes. Moreover, OPRs appear to be most effective at reducing
   property-related crime. Modifications of this performance management
   process may help to generalize its effects to other types of crime.
   Originality/value - This study was the first to provide a systematic
   examination of the impact of OPRs on a relatively large number of
   offence categories.

AB Monensin is widely used as a feed additive to improve performance of
   livestock; however accidental poisoning by this ionophore compound has
   been reported in a number of animal species. Typical clinical signs and
   lesions of monensin poisoning were induced in water buffaloes dosed
   with single dosages of 15, 10, 7.5, and 5mg/kg of the compound. Only
   buffaloes dosed with 2.5 mg/kg (1 day) and 1 mg/kg (7 days) survived.
   Clinical signs initiated about 6 h post-dosing and included apathy,
   anorexia, diarrhea, drooling, muscular weakness, locomotion disorders,
   dyspnea, tachycardia, jugular distension and pulse, recumbency and
   death. The creatine kinase (CK) levels were highly augmented in blood
   samples of buffaloes dosed with monensin. Most prominent gross changes
   were ascites, hydrothorax, hydropericardium, cardiomegaly,
   hepatomegaly, and focal pale areas in the myocardium and in skeletal
   muscles. Degeneration and necrosis of myofibers were the principal
   histopathological findings. Conversely, no evidence of disease, neither
   change in CK levels were observed in the beef cattle steers dosed with
   same doses, confirming preliminary findings that buffaloes are more
   susceptible to monensin than cattle. In addition, this communication
   presents the minimal toxic dosage of monensin to buffaloes and suggests
   that CK tests may serve as health monitoring tools in the management of
   buffalo herds supplemented with monensin.

   of construction employment. It summarises the challenges inherent in
   construction work which have impeded the development of human resource
   management within the sector and discusses the mutually supporting
   contributions of the papers in furthering our understanding of how to
   improve the performance of the industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - The operational context of the sector is
   reviewed briefly, before the efficacy of the industry's employment
   practices are examined through a review of the contributions contained
   within the special section.
   Findings - The papers reveal the interplay of structural and cultural
   factors which have led to the skills shortages currently impeding the
   industry's development. There is a need for the sector to modernise and
   formalise its working and employment practices if performance and
   productivity improvements are to be achieved.
   Originality/value - By revealing the interconnected nature of the
   construction employment perspectives presented within this special
   section, this paper presents a case for adopting a fresh
   transdisciplinary research agenda for addressing the industry's

TI A competency-based model for construction supervisors in developing
   countries
SO PERSONNEL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE line managers; construction industry; human resource management;
   competences; developing countries; Chile
AB Purpose - To analyze the role of construction site supervisors,
   including foremen and general foremen, as front-line managers. The role
   is treated as a critical labor function and a source of value-added for
   construction management.
   Design/methodology/approach - An original model based on the labor
   competency management framework is proposed for training, developing
   and certifying construction supervisors in Chile and other developing
   countries. This model was developed from the findings of a case study
   in which the competency framework was applied to a specific
   construction company.
   Findings - This case study has demonstrated the significant potential
   of the competency framework for the Chilean construction sector, with
   its underdeveloped human resources management methods. In particular,
   this framework can be an effective approach to achieving the
   competencies required by construction site supervisors who must deal
   with inadequately trained workers, as is the case in many developing
   countries. The structured approach of the competency framework can help
   companies create more objective schemes for the design and
   implementation of training programs.
   Practical implications - The application of the competency approach can
   greatly improve the human resources management function in construction
   companies as well as the site performance of their personnel. The
   findings obtained so far in Chile can also be projected to construction
   companies in other developing countries in the region.
   Originality/value - This paper presents the first application of the
   competency framework to a Chilean construction company. This study is
   also original in the sense that the application described here was
   carried out in an environment where human resource conditions are quite
   deficient.

DE QoS; service oriented architectures; performance; QoS broker
ID WEB SERVICES
AB The next generation of software systems will be highly distributed,
   component-based and service-oriented. They will need to operate in
   unattended mode and possibly in hostile environments, will be composed
   of a large number of 'replaceable' components discoverable at run-time,
   and will have to run on a multitude of unknown and heterogeneous
   hardware and network platforms. This paper focuses on QoS management in
   service-oriented architectures in which service providers (SP) provide
   a set of interrelated services to service consumers, and a QoS broker
   mediates QoS negotiations between SPs and consumers. The main
   contributions of this paper are: (i) the description of an architecture
   that includes a QoS broker and service provider software components,
   (ii) the specification of a secure protocol for QoS negotiation with
   the support of a QoS broker, (iii) the specification of an admission
   control mechanism used by SPs, (iv) a report on the implementation of
   the QoS broker and SPs, and (v) the experimental validation of the
   ideas presented in the paper. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Objective: We developed a tool to identify self-assessment of skills
   for advanced HF assessment and management and knowledge of HF care.
   Methods: A framework for nursing competency in HF care was developed
   and its face validity confirmed through expert review. An initial
   instrument was pilot tested and revised. The survey tool was validated
   via administration to nurses expert in HF care and nurses novice in HF
   care. Descriptive statistics were used to identify sample
   characteristics; t-tests and Chi-square analysis were used to compare
   the novice and expert g-goups. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was
   performed to test whether expert scores differed from novice scores.
   Results: Thirty-six HF "expert" nurses and 85 hospice "novice" nurses
   completed the survey. The survey took 19.6 min on average (mean) with a
   mode of 15 min to complete. Self assessment of competence resulted in
   generally lower ratings by novice nurses (mean = 69.6; S.D. = 10.5)
   than by expert nurses (mean = 81.9: S.D. = 6.7), t (119) = 6.47, p <
   0.001. HF nurse experts scored themselves less comfortable than did the
   hospice nurses in the three questions that dealt with coping,
   bereavement, and communication about dying and prognosis. The mean
   knowledge scores for experts (30.3; S.D. = 2.5) were significantly
   higher than for novices (22.1; S.D. = 4.0), t (119) 11.47, p < 0.00).
   The standardized alpha coefficient of the survey was 0.78 for the
   questions about knowledge, indicating acceptable reliability of the
   survey as a tool to discriminate knowledge. Many novice nurses
   over-estimated their competence in HF assessment and prognostication
   compared to their performance on the knowledge portion of the survey.
   Conclusion: The Advanced Heart Failure Clinical Competence Survey
   adequately distinguishes between novice nurses' self-assessment of
   skills and their demonstrated knowledge of HF assessment and management
   and those of HF nurse experts.
   Practice implications: The Advanced Heart Failure Clinical Competence
   Survey can identify hospice nurses' confidence and knowledge or the
   need for education to enable patient and family education and
   counseling regarding self-care, medications, distressing symptoms and
   approaching the end of life. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB Epidemiological and clinical researches in the borderline domain
   between psychology and cancer have produced consequent results, despite
   the large variety of employed approaches and aimed goals: these results
   permit to define domains where new investigations still appear
   promising. If randomized prospective controlled trials that test the
   impact of psychosocial interventions, constitute to our mind a strategy
   that must not be bypassed, a special attention should be focussed on
   the following topics: 1) it seems necessary to add to standard goals
   (survival and quality of life) the evaluation of the impact on immunity
   and main biological rhythms (circadian and ultradian). Specific
   questionnaires should be included (pain, sleep, mood, self-esteem, life
   events...) and others may need to be developed or adapted (sexuality,
   spirituality, coping with death); 2) among types of psychosocial
   management, hypnosis and/or learning of self-hypnosis appears to be a
   modality of choice since some results have already been obtained on
   immune pathologies and also on cancer. Mixed to an approach of clinical
   psychology, such a management could arouse behavior changes toward
   pathology but also promote an improvement of biological rhythms (action
   on sleep...) and perhaps, by the way, an immune rebound; 3) on a
   methodological point of view, trials cannot be double-blind. The effort
   must then concern sample sizes, that were often insufficient in many
   trials, but also targeted populations: palliative cancer patients with
   a good performance status seem more relevant for this type of
   investigation, since psychosocial interventions usually improve quality
   of life. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

AB BACKGROUND: To assess the value of positron emission
   tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with F-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose
   (FDG) in patients with head and neck carcinoma as compared with PET and
   conventional imaging alone, and to assess the impact of PET/CT on
   further clinical management.
   STUDY DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized study.
   SETTING: Ninety patients with head and neck tumors had 107 PET/CT
   examinations.
   RESULTS: The study analysis showed that PET/CT had a sensitivity of
   89%, specificity 95%, PPV 94%, NPV 90%, and accuracy of 92%. PET/CT
   altered management in 51 patients (56%). PET/CT eliminated the need for
   previously planned diagnostic procedures in 24 patients, induced a
   change in the planned therapeutic approach in 21 patients and guided
   biopsy in 6 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT is an imaging modality with high diagnostic
   performance in the assessment of head and neck cancer, and induced a
   change in further clinical management in more than half of the study
   population. (C) 2007 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck

TI VN-KIM IE: Automatic extraction of Vietnamese named-entities on the web
SO NEW GENERATION COMPUTING

AB The most fascinating advantage of the semantic web would be its
   capability of understanding and processing the contents of web pages
   automatically. Basically, the semantic web realization involves two
   main tasks: (1) Representation and management of a large amount of data
   and metadata for web contents; (2) Information extraction and
   annotation on web pages. On the one hand, recognition of named-entities
   is regarded as a basic and important problem to be solved, before
   deeper semantics of a web page could be extracted. On the other hand,
   semantic web information extraction is a language-dependent problem,
   which requires particular natural language processing techniques. This
   paper introduces VN-KIM IE, the information extraction module of the
   semantic web system VN-KIM that we have developed. The function of
   VN-KIM IE is to automatically recognize named-entities in Vietnamese
   web pages, by identifying their classes, and addresses if existing, in
   the knowledge base of discourse. That information is then annotated to
   those web pages, providing a basis for NE-based searching on them, as
   compared to the current keyword-based one. The design, implementation,
   and performance of VN-KIM IE are presented and discussed.

AB Under the title of anterior circulation aneurysms and the pterional
   approach, followings are presented and emphasized along with mentioning
   their historical development in our present performance status.
   Pterional approach: head positioning with Mayfield-Kees fixation
   apparatus using one pin around the processus matoideus and the other 2
   pins on the contralateral side behind the hair line the head turned 30
   degrees and reclined chin-up 15-20 grade. Skin incision beginning just
   in front of the tragus ending up at the midline hair line in a
   curvilinear fashion always including the superficial temporal artery
   STA in its frontal branch and the facial nerve (frontal branch) in the
   skin flap. A muscle fascial preparation is so fashioned such that a
   strip of myofascial cuff is left at the linea temporalis and the
   temporal musculature is reflected and retracted towards the
   postero-basal direction in order to expose the pterion, for which a
   small short myofascial incision is added parallel to the skin incision
   towards the tragus up to several cm above it to prevent postoperative
   trismus. Bone flap is sawed out usually using three burr holes, at the
   key hole just at the proximal part of the linea temporalis,
   frontomedially on the squama frontalis and on the sutura squamosa, so
   that the Sylvian fissure and the superior temporal gyros are exposed
   enough for further procedure. The sphenoid ridge is drilled away until
   the most lateral corner of the superior orbital fissure comes into
   view. Thus one has drilled away enough to do surgery in question at the
   skull base even at the time of "angry brain" due to subarachnoid
   hemorrhage SAH. This procedure can be followed by selective extradural
   anterior clinoidectomy SEAC in case of necessity. The dura is opened in
   a curvilinear fashion so that the dura can be reflected over the
   drilled sphenoid wing and so that the Sylvian fissure and the superior
   temporal gyros is exposed for the treatment of aneurysms of the
   internal carotid artery ICA, of the anterior communicating artery AcomA
   and the middle cerebral artery MCA. The dural incision is suitable also
   for doing other surgeries e.g. basilar bifurcation aneurysms and
   amygdalohippocampectomy AHE.
   Following points are emphasised in aneurysm surgery at the acute stage
   of SAH: 1) Artificial hypotension of the systolic pressure down to 100
   mmHg. 2) Use of temporary clipping (or trapping) method not only for
   the management of premature rupture but for complete dissection of
   aneurysms and for optimal neck clipping. 3) Opening of the lamina
   terminalis to gain slackness of "angry brain" and to insert an external
   ventricular drainage at the end of surgery for the intracranial
   pressure ICP registration and its regulation. 4) Importance of subpial
   approximation ("subpiale Annaherung") at the time of aneurysm
   dissection to take advantage of the strength of the pia mater over (the
   arachnoid) and the dome of aneurysm. 5) Use of oxycellulose Tabotamp(R)
   insertion technique between the aneurysm neck and neighbouring
   perforators to avoid inclusion of the latter ("Mitklippen") at the time
   of neck clipping. 6) Double clipping method at the time of incomplete
   neck clipping due to athromatous plaque. Combination of fenestrated
   clip and standard clip or "puncture and collapse" method at the time of
   aneurysm incorporation of parent and /or branching arteries. 7) Use of
   microDoppler to confirm patency of the parent arteries and their
   branches.
   For doing surgery of aneurysms of main cerebral arteries following
   points are discussed: 1) AcomA aneurysms; a) Aneurysms located lower
   than 1.5 cm above the level of the anterior clinoid process in the
   lateral view on digital subtraction angiography DSA can be managed with
   conventional pterional approach. b) Usually from the right side (non
   dominant hemisphere) but in the following situations from the left
   side: hematoma on the left side, concomitant unruptured aneurysms on
   the left side, left A1 dominancy at the acute stage of SAH and its
   dissection is considered to be difficult from the right side. c) Always
   rectal gyrus approach to the aneurysm with any direction. This also
   enables safety subpial approximation "subpiale Annaeherung" to
   aneurysms. d) No use of coagulation as much as possible. 2) ICA
   aneurysms; a) Performance of selective extradural anterior
   clinoidectomy SEAC for paraclinoid aneurysms not only for aneurysm
   dissection but for proximal control. b) Neither sacrifice nor
   Mitklippen of the posterior communicating artery at the time of
   ICA-PcomA aneurysms, not only for the prevention of the PCA infarction
   in case of its embryonal type but also for the prevention of
   tuberothalamic infarction due to compromise of the anterior
   thalamoperforating arteries originating from the PcomA. 0 Dissecting
   aneurysms of the ICA: difficulties of diagnosis or differentiation from
   paraclinoid anurysms. Difficulties of optimal direct clipping and
   resort to trapping or proximal ligation plus bypass. Its predilection
   site is at the medial anterior wall of the C1 portion but may occur
   also in any other portion of the ICA.
   3) Middle cerebral artery MCA aneurysms; a) For dissection, superior
   temporal gyrus ablation is not necessary but opening of the Sylvian
   fissure by retrograde tracing of a cortical artery on the surface of
   the temporal lobe. This cortical artery can be used as recipient when a
   bypass surgery turns out to be necessary with the use of a donor artery
   from the frontal branch of the STA. b) Importance of interpreting DSA
   or 3DCT angiography in regard to whether the aneurysm dome is outside
   (lateral) or inside (medial) of the MCA bifurcation. This helps in
   anticipating whether the aneurysm dome or MCA branches come into view
   first at the time of intraSylvian dissection. c) In case of presence of
   aneurysms at the contralateral MCA, accessibility from the ipsilateral
   side depends on the distance form the midline (for example early
   bifurcation), the relationship to the sphenoid wing (not below the
   level of the sphenoid wing) and no strong Sylvian vein darining into
   the sphenoparietal sinus being in the way.

AB Background: Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) has been proposed as specific
   biochemical marker for myocardial infarction in adults. Cardiac
   function in neonates could be influenced by the severity of respiratory
   distress and its ventilatory management. Objectives: To establish a
   normal range of cTnT in healthy neonates, compare troponin
   concentrations among healthy neonates and those in respiratory distress
   ( sick) and detect whether any correlation occurs between severity of
   respiratory distress and troponin concentrations. Methods:
   Concentrations of cTnT were compared between sick and healthy infants,
   accounting for confounding variables in a prospective investigation
   manner. Age at sampling, need for ventilation, duration of respiratory
   support, and inotropic use in addition to neonatal and maternal
   characteristics were assessed. Results: Samples were collected from164
   neonates ( 116 healthy and 48 sick). The medians [interquartile ranges]
   of cTnT in healthy and sick infants were 0.044 [0.027-0.073] mu g/l and
   0.121 [0.065-0.238] mu g/l, respectively, with p < 0.0001. The 99th
   percentile for healthy neonates was 0.244 mu g/l. Comparing both
   groups, there were significant differences concerning gestation, birth
   weight, Apgar at 5 min and admission to neonatal intensive care unit.
   Troponin concentrations in subgroups of sick infants including
   hypotensive, ventilated and dead infants were higher than other infants
   of the same subgroup. CTnT was positively correlated to the duration of
   respiratory support in ventilated neonates. Conclusion: CTnT may prove
   to be a useful early marker for cardiac and respiratory dysfunction in
   newborns. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Manufacturer rebates are commonly used as price discount tools for
   attracting end customers. In this study, we consider a two-stage supply
   chain with a manufacturer and a retailer, where a single seasonal
   product faces uncertain and price-sensitive demand. We characterize the
   impact of a manufacturer rebate on the expected profits of both the
   manufacturer and the retailer. We show that unless all of the customers
   claim the rebate, the rebate always benefits the manufacturer. Our
   results thus imply that "mail-in rebates," where some customers end up
   not claiming the rebate, particularly when the size of the rebate is
   relatively small, always benefit the manufacturer. On the other hand,
   an "instant rebate," such as the one offered in the automotive industry
   where every customer redeems the rebate on the spot when he/she
   purchases a car, does not necessarily benefit the manufacturer. (c)

AB Purpose: To explore the predictors of physical capacity and
   participation in older community-dwelling individuals living with
   multiple chronic diseases.
   Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional investigation of
   physical capacity (physiological potential) and physical activity
   participation (recorded engagement in physical activity). Multiple
   regression and odds ratios were used to investigate determinants of
   physical capacity (6-min walk test) and physical activity participation
   (Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities
   Questionnaire; pedometer steps per day).
   Results: Two hundred community-dwelling ambulatory participants living
   with two or more chronic diseases were assessed. Sixty-five percent
   (65%) were women, and the mean age was 74 +/- 6 yr (range 65-90 yr).
   Mobility (timed up and go) was a consistent determinant across all
   three primary outcomes. For the 6-min walk test, determinants included
   mobility, BMI, grip strength, number of medications, leg strength,
   balance, and Chronic Disease Management Self-Efficacy Scale (r(2) =
   0.58; P = 0.000). The determinants for the self-reported participation
   measure (Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical
   Disabilities Questionnaire) was mobility (r(2) = 0.04; P = 0.007). For
   the mean daily pedometer steps, the determinants included mobility,
   body mass index (BMI), age, and Chronic Disease Management
   Self-Efficacy Scale (r2 = 0.27; P 0.000). There were higher risks for
   inactivity associated with impairments compared with the presence of a
   chronic disease. In addition, more than a third of participants had
   sufficient physical capacity but did not meet minimal recommendations
   of physical activity.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that it is easier to predict an
   individual's physical capacity than their actual physical participation.

AB Acute aortic dissection of the thoracic aorta represents a medical
   emergency that, despite its rare occurrence, is characterized by severe
   morbidity and mortality Prompt diagnosis is the key to a desired
   outcome. According to current, clinical data, diagnosis is mostly based
   on a high index of suspicion and diagnostic imaging and less on
   clinical Manifestations. Oil the other hand, a biochemical approach to
   the entity is still falling short in terms of diagnostic practice,
   although optimistic efforts are being made towards the development of
   such methods. Myocin heavy-chain concentrations, D-dimer levels, and
   soluble elastin fragment measurement are some of the new promising
   tools emerging in the battle of acute diagnosis. Despite their
   potentials, all three still need to be reevaluated. More prospective
   clinical trials should be performed so as to improve and ensure a
   biochemical diagnostic method for acute aortic dissection of high
   sensitivity and specificity and thus of great clinical value.
   Search of the Literature: Two reviewers performed a literature search,
   identified the relevant studies to be included in this review, and
   extracted the data. Relevant studies for inclusion in this review were
   identified through PubMed as well as from references of the initially
   found articles. The search terms used were "myocin-heavy chains",
   "D-dimers", "soluble elastin fragments", "biochemical diagnosis",
   "aortic dissection", "sensitivity", "specificity", and "performance
   characteristics".

AB The ability of compensators (e.g., bow-tie filters) designed for kV
   cone-beam computed tomography (CT) to reduce both scatter reaching the
   detector and dose to the patient is investigated. Scattered x rays
   reaching the detector are widely recognized as one of the most
   significant challenges to cone-beam CT imaging performance. With
   cone-beam CT gaining popularity as a method of guiding treatments in
   radiation therapy, any methods that have the potential to reduce the
   dose to patients and/or improve image quality should be investigated.
   Simple compensators with a design that could realistically be
   implemented on a cone-beam CT imaging system have been constructed to
   determine the magnitude of reduction of scatter and/or dose for various
   cone-beam CT imaging conditions. Depending on the situation, the
   compensators were shown to reduce x-ray scatter at the detector and
   dose to the patient by more than a factor of 2. Further optimization of
   the compensators is a possibility to achieve greater reductions in both
   scatter and dose. (C) 2007 American Association of Physicists in

AB We consider two classical stochastic inventory control models, the
   periodic-review stochastic inventory control problem and the stochastic
   lot-sizing problem. The goal is to coordinate a sequence of orders of a
   single commodity, aiming to supply stochastic demands over a discrete,
   finite horizon with minimum expected overall ordering, holding, and
   backlogging costs. In this paper, we address the important problem of
   finding computationally efficient and provably good inventory control
   policies for these models in the presence of correlated, nonstationary
   (time-dependent), and evolving stochastic demands. This problem arises
   in many domains and has many practical applications in supply chain
   management.
   Our approach is based on a new marginal cost accounting scheme for
   stochastic inventory control models combined with novel cost-balancing
   techniques. Specifically, in each period, we balance the expected cost
   of overordering (i.e., costs incurred by excess inventory) against the
   expected cost of underordering (i.e., costs incurred by not satisfying
   demand on time). This leads to what we believe to be the first
   computationally efficient policies with constant worst-case performance
   guarantees for a general class of important stochastic inventory
   control models. That is, there exists a constant C such that, for any
   instance of the problem, the expected cost of the policy is at most C
   times the expected cost of an optimal policy. In particular, we provide
   a worst-case guarantee of two for the periodic-review stochastic
   inventory control problem and a worst-case guarantee of three for the
   stochastic lot-sizing problem. Our results are valid for all of the
   currently known approaches in the literature to model correlation and
   nonstationarity of demands over time.

AB Accurate estimation of River flow changes is a quite important problem
   for a wise and sustainable use. Such a problem is crucial to the works
   and decisions related to the water resources and management. In this
   study, an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
   approach was used to construct a River flow forecasting system. In
   particular, the applicability of ANFIS as an estimation model for River
   flow was investigated. To illustrate the applicability and capability
   of the ANFIS, the River Great Menderes. located die west of Turkey and
   the most important water resource of Great Menderes Catchment's, was
   chosen as a case study area. The advantage of this method is that it
   uses the input-output data sets. Totally 5844 daily data sets collected
   in 1985-2000 years were used to estimate the River flow. The models
   having various input structures were constructed and the best structure
   was investigated. In addition four various training/testing data sets
   were constructed by cross validation methods and the best data set was
   investigated. T-ie performance of the ANFIS models in training and
   testing sets were compared with the observations and also evaluated.
   The results indicated that the ANFIS can be applied successfully and
   provide high accuracy and reliability for River flow estimation. (C)

AB The flexible manufacturing system ( FMS) has attracted substantial
   amount of research effort during the last twenty years. Most of the
   studies address the issues of flexibility, productivity, cost, and so
   forth. The impact of flexible lines on product quality is less studied.
   This paper intends to address this issue by applying a Markov model to
   evaluate quality performance of a flexible manufacturing system. Closed
   expressions to calculate good part probability are derived and
   discussions to maintain high product quality are carried out. An
   example of flexible fixture in machining system is provided to
   illustrate the applicability of the method. The results of this study
   suggest a possible approach to investigate the impact of flexibility on
   product quality and, finally, with extensions and enrichment of the
   model, may lead to provide production engineers and managers a better
   understanding of the quality implications and to summarize some general
   guidelines of operation management in flexible manufacturing systems.

TI Implementation of the newsvendor model with clearance pricing: How to

AB The newsvendor model is designed to decide how much of a product to
   order when the product is to be sold over a short selling season with
   stochastic demand and there are no additional opportunities to
   replenish inventory. There are many practical situations that
   reasonably conform to those assumptions, but the traditional newsvendor
   model also assumes a fixed salvage value: all inventory left over at
   the end of the season is sold off at a fixed per-unit price. The fixed
   salvage value assumption is questionable when a clearance price is
   rationally chosen in response to the events observed during the selling
   season: a deep discount should be taken if there is plenty of inventory
   remaining at the end of the season, whereas a shallow discount is
   appropriate for a product with higher than expected demand. This paper
   solves for the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor model, assuming
   rational clearance pricing. We then study the performance of the
   traditional newsvendor model. The key to effective implementation of
   the traditional newsvendor model is choosing an appropriate fixed
   salvage value. (We show that an optimal order quantity cannot be
   generally achieved by merely enhancing the traditional newsvendor model
   to include a nonlinear salvage value function.) We demonstrate that
   several intuitive methods for estimating the salvage value can lead to
   an excessively large order quantity and a substantial profit loss. Even
   though the traditional model can result in poor performance, the model
   seems as if it is working correctly: the order quantity chosen is
   optimal given the salvage value inputted to the model, and the observed
   salvage value given the chosen order quantity equals the inputted one.
   We discuss how to estimate a salvage value that leads the traditional
   newsvendor model to the optimal or near-optimal order quantity Our
   results highlight the importance of understanding how a model can
   interact with its own inputs: when inputs to a model are influenced by
   the decisions of the model, care is needed to appreciate how that
   interaction influences the decisions recommended by the model and how
   the model's inputs should be estimated.

AB An 80% dysfunction rate at 2 years limits the use of transjugular
   intrahepatic portosystemic shunts ( TIPS) in the treatment of
   complications of portal hypertension. The use of covered stents could
   improve shunt patency; however, long- term effect and safety remain
   unknown. Eighty patients randomized to be treated by TIPS either with a
   covered stent ( Group 1) or an uncovered prosthesis ( Group 2) were
   followed- up for 2 years. Doppler US was performed every 3 months.
   Angiography and portosystemic pressure gradient measurement were
   performed every 6 months or whenever dysfunction was suspected.
   Actuarial rates of primary patency in Groups 1 and 2 were 76% and 36%
   respectively ( P = 0.001). Clinical relapse occurred in four patients (
   10%) in Group 1 and 12 ( 29%) in Group 2 ( P<0.05). Actuarial rates of
   being free of encephalopathy were 67% in Group 1 and 51% in Group 2 (
   P<0.05). Probability of survival was 58% and 45% at 2 years,
   respectively, in Groups 1 and 2 ( NS). The mean Child - Pugh score
   improved only in Group 1 ( from 8.1 +/- 1.6 to 7 +/- 2.2 at 2 years -
   P<0.05). We also compared the Doppler- US parameters between patent and
   dysfunctioning shunts. In patent shunts, the mean velocity within the
   portal vein was significantly higher but the performance of Doppler- US
   was not accurate enough to predict shunt dysfunction. In conclusion,
   the improvement in TIPS patency by using covered prostheses is
   maintained over time with a decreased risk of encephalopathy, while the
   risk of death was not increased.

ID DISORDERS
AB Academic underachievement is wide-spread in adolescence and proses a
   considerable risk for further development. Many youngsters are
   appropriately placed in school, but nevertheless show unsufficient
   school performance so that their ability to continue in school is in
   great danger. Often the relationship between the youngster and the
   parent is very much impaired due to the academic problems as well. The
   so far available guidebooks, self-help manuals, and training programs
   available to date for the treatment of achievement problems within
   adolescence have not been empirically evaluated. The treatment approach
   SELBST - a treatment program for adolescents with problems in
   self-esteem, achievement, and relationships - aims at tackling common
   problems in adolescence and takes into account particularities in the
   therapeutic work with youngsters. SELBST is not disorder specific,
   multimodal, and consists of adolescent, parent and teacher focused
   interventions. The module "achievement problems" is part of the
   treatment program and tries to enhance achievement motivation and
   organizational skills, to improve active participation during lessons,
   and to reduce gaps in knowledge. The therapeutic work is described on
   the basis of a case vignette, results of a clinical study are
   summarized.

TI Too old to benefit from sports? The cardiovascular effects of exercise

ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; AEROBIC EXERCISE; PULSE
   PRESSURE; RISK FACTOR; DISEASE; TRANSPLANTATION; GUIDELINES;
   MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY
AB Background: Hypertension in the elderly is commonly characterized by an
   elevation of pulse pressure. With regard to advanced arteriosclerosis
   and limited physical fitness, doubt was casted whether elderly patients
   still achieve relevant cardiovascular benefits by physical exercise.
   The present work examines the impact of pulse pressure as a footprint
   of vascular ageing on cardiovascular benefits of endurance training in
   elderly hypertensives. Methods: 54 patients >= 60 years with systolic
   24- hour ambulatory blood pressure ( ABP) > 140 mm Hg and/ or
   antihypertensive treatment and diastolic ABP <= 90 mm Hg were randomly
   assigned to sedentary activity or a 12- week treadmill exercise program
   ( target lactate 2.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/ l). Results: Exercise significantly
   decreased systolic and diastolic ABP by 8.5 +/- 8.2 and 5.1 +/- 3.7 mm
   Hg ( p < 0.001 each) and increased physical performance. Arterial
   compliance remained unchanged, whereas endotheliumdependent
   vasodilation - measured by flow- mediated dilation - significantly
   increased from 5.6 +/- 1.7 to 7.9 +/- 3.0% ( p < 0.007). After
   adjustment for initial systolic ABP, pulse pressure did not affect the
   change of BP. Conclusion: The exercise- induced reduction of BP, which
   is mediated by improved endothelial function, is independent of pulse
   pressure. Thus, physical exercise is a helpful adjunct to control BP
   even in old hypertensives with markedly increased arterial stiffness.

   distance; wildlife restoration
ID MENINGEAL WORM; PELLET-GROUP; HABITAT SELECTION; SCALE; POPULATION;

AB We used spatial data to identify potential areas for elk (Cervus
   elaphus) restoration in Arkansas. To assess habitat, we used locations
   of 239 elk groups collected from helicopter surveys in the Buffalo
   National River area of northwestern Arkansas, USA, from 1992 to 2002.
   We calculated the Mahalanobis distance (D) statistic based on the
   relationship between those elk-group locations and a suite of 9
   landscape variables to evaluate winter habitat in Arkansas. We tested
   model performance in the Buffalo National River area by comparing the
   D-2 values of pixels representing areas with and without elk pellets
   along 19 fixed-width transects surveyed in March 2002. Pixels with elk
   scat had lower D-2 values than pixels in which we found no pellets
   (logistic regression: Wald chi(2) = 24.37, P < 0.001), indicating that
   habitat characteristics were similar to those selected by the aerially
   surveyed elk. Our D-2 model indicated that the best elk habitat
   primarily occurred in northern and western Arkansas and was associated
   with areas of high landscape heterogeneity, heavy forest cover, gently
   sloping ridge tops and valleys, low human population density, and low
   road densities. To assess the potential for elk-human conflicts in
   Arkansas, we used the analytical hierarchy process to rank the
   importance of 8 criteria based on expert opinion from biologists
   involved in elk management. The biologists ranked availability of
   forage on public lands as having the strongest influence on the
   potential for elk-human conflict (33%), followed by human population
   growth rate (22%) and the amount of private land in row crops (18%). We
   then applied those rankings in a weighted linear summation to map the
   relative potential for elk-human conflict. Finally, we used
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) densities to identify areas
   where success of elk restoration may be hampered due to meningeal worm
   (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) transmission. By combining results of the
   3 spatial data layers (i.e., habitat model, elk-human conflict model,
   deer density), our model indicated that restoration sites located in
   west-central and north-central Arkansas were most favorable for
   reintroduction.

AB The correct assessment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes and
   subtypes by commercial assays is of utmost importance mainly for the
   therapeutic management of patients suffering from HCV infections. In
   this study, the performance characteristics of a newly designed
   genotyping assay were evaluated that does not rely exclusively on
   sequence information derived from the 5'untranslated region but also
   takes into account part of the HCV core. One hundred and ten clinical
   specimens were tested by this new assay prior to its commercialisation.
   The obtained typing results were compared to those recorded by the
   5'UTR-based Versant HCV Genotyping Assay, version 1, the core-related
   Gen-Efi K DEIA, and phylogenetic analyses of partial HCV core and NS5B
   sequences. The HCV genotypes and subtypes identified by the newly
   devised kit were completely in line with the assignments achieved by
   DEIA and phylogenetic analyses. In particular, all 64 HCV strains
   belonging to subtypes la or lb were recognised correctly, and HCV 6e
   and 6f isolates were adequately assigned to subtypes 6c-1. Thus, the
   second generation of the Versant genotyping assay could overcome the
   drawbacks of its exclusively 5'UTR-based predecessor and will turn out
   to be a reliable toot for HCV typing in clinical laboratories. (C) 2007

TI Angiography for blunt splenic trauma does not improve the success rate
   of nonapevative management
SO JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE

ID NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; ARTERY LIGATION; SELECTIVE EMBOLIZATION;
   NONSURGICAL MANAGEMENT; INJURED SPLEEN; BLOOD-FLOW; EXPERIENCE;
   SALVAGE; SPLENECTOMY; ARTERIOGRAPHY
AB Background. Splenic artery arteriography with possible therapeutic
   embolization (SAE) has been postulated to improve the success rate of
   nonoperative management of blunt splenic injuries and increase splenic
   salvage. Previous reports, however, have compared SAE with historical
   controls. We compared nonoperative success with SAE with a
   contemporaneous group treated nonoperatively without SAE.
   Methods: Patients who suffered blunt splenic trauma from 2000 to 2004
   were identified. Demographic and outcome data were abstracted. Data on
   the performance of SAE, type of vessel embolized, and success or
   failure of nonoperative management were collected. Analysis of
   variance, chi(2), and regression analysis were used to evaluate the
   impact of SAE on outcome.
   Results. There were 570 patients who suffered blunt splenic trauma and
   221 (39%) were treated operatively. There were 349 patients who were
   treated non-operatively and 46 (13.2%) underwent SAE. SAE was more
   frequently used for patients with spleen Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS)
   >= 3 (31 %) than AIS = 2 (6.7%). For patients with spleen AIS >= 3,,
   there was no difference in age, gender, Injury Severity Score, or
   admission blood pressure between those who did or did not undergo SAE.
   The nonoperative success rate was similar for patients who did (79.3%)
   and those that did not (78.8%) undergo SAE.
   Conclusions: Patients who underwent splenic arteriography did not have
   improved nonoperative splenic salvage rates compared with a
   contemporaneous control group of similarly injured patients. Subsets of
   patients with blunt trauma may benefit from SAE but further study will
   be required to define these patients.

TI Prehospital procedures before emergency department thoracotomy: "Scoop
   and run" saves lives
SO JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE

   HYPOTENSIVE PATIENTS; FLUID RESUSCITATION; PROMPT TRANSPORT;
   CARDIAC-ARREST; TRAUMA; SURVIVAL; TIME
AB Background. The role of prehospital healthcare personnel in the
   management of acutely injured patients is rapidly evolving. However,
   the performance of prehospital procedures on unstable, penetrating
   trauma patients remains controversial. The objective of this study is
   to test the hypothesis that survival of most critically injured
   penetrating trauma patients requiring emergency department thoracotomy
   (EDT) would be improved if procedures were restricted until arrival to
   the trauma bay.
   Methods. A retrospective chart review on 180 consecutive penetrating
   trauma patients (2000-2005) who underwent EDT was performed. Patients
   were divided into two groups by mode of transportation and compared on
   the basis of demographics, clinical and physiologic parameters,
   prehospital procedures, and survival.
   Results. Eighty-eight patients arrived by emergency medical services
   (EMS), and 92 were brought by police or private vehicle. Groups were
   similar with respect to demographics. Seven of 88 (8.0%)
   EMS-transported patients survived until hospital discharge, and 16 of
   92 (17.4%) survived after police or private transportation. Overall,
   137 prehospital procedures were performed in 78 of 88 (88.6%)
   EMS-transported patients, but no police- or private-transported patient
   underwent field procedures. Multivariate logistic regression analyses
   identified prehospital procedures as the sole independent predictor of
   mortality. For each procedure, patients were 2.63 times more likely to
   die before hospital discharge (OR = 0.38, 95 % CI = 0.18-0.79, p =
   0.0096).
   Conclusions: The performance of prehospital procedures in critical,
   penetrating trauma victims had a negative impact on survival after EDT
   in our study population. Paramedics should adhere to a minimal or
   "scoop and run" approach to prehospital transportation in this setting.

AB Background: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a severe disease
   that is often difficult to diagnose. A clinical scoring system, the
   '4Ts' score, has been proposed to estimate its probability before
   laboratory testing, and a particle gel immunoassay (H/PF4 PaGIA((R)))
   has also been developed for rapid detection of HIT antibodies. Aim: To
   evaluate the performance of both methods when HIT is suspected
   clinically. Methods: Two hundred thirteen consecutive patients were
   included in four centers. The probability of HIT was evaluated using
   the 4Ts score blind to antibody test results. HIT was confirmed only
   when the serotonin release assay (SRA) was positive. Results: The risk
   of HIT was evaluated by the 4Ts score as low (LowR), intermediate (IR)
   or high (HR) in 34.7%, 60.6% and 4.7% of patients, respectively. The
   negative predictive value (NPV) of the 4Ts score was 100%, as the SRA
   was negative in all LowR patients. PaGIA((R)) was negative in 176
   patients without HIT (99.4%, NPV) and the negative likelihood ratio
   (LR-) was 0.05. PaGIA((R)) was positive in 37 patients, including 21
   with HIT (positive predictive value = 56.8%), with a positive LR of
   11.4. A negative PaGIA((R)) result decreased the probability of HIT in
   IR patients from 10.9% before assay to 0.6%, whereas a positive result
   did not substantially increase the likelihood for HIT. Conclusion: The
   use of the 4Ts score with PaGIA((R)) appears to be a reliable strategy
   to rule out HIT.

AB Companies that are able to help clients make better decisions and
   enhance their business capabilities to flourish. However, there is
   often poor rapport between operating personnel who are in touch with
   end customers and executive personnel who make decisions. Through
   exploration and exploitation processes, new ideas and actions flow from
   the individual (i.e., operating personnel) to the organization (i.e.,
   the rest of individuals and groups that form pail of the organization).
   This paper examines the relative importance and significance of "the
   relationship memory" as a bridge between "exploration" and
   "exploitation" processes and its effects on the creation of "customer
   capital" through an empirical investigation of 139 small to
   medium-sized enterprises in the Spanish optometry sector using
   structural equation modeling validated by factor analysis.

AB Objective As surgical management of children with congenital heart
   disease (CHD) advanced, developmental outcome became the main focus of
   contemporary research. In this study, we specify the cognitive profile
   of children with CHD, 6 to 12 years postoperatively.
   Study design Patients with CHD (n = 43, mean age 8 years, 8 months) and
   healthy controls (n = 43, mean age 8 years, 11 months). were examined
   with an abbreviated intelligence scale (Weehsler Intelligence Scale for
   Children-3rd edition. Dutch version) and a developmental
   neuropsychological assessment battery (NEPSY [a developmental
   NEuroPSYchological assessment]).
   Results We identified significantly lower scores for the CHD group on
   Estimated Full Scale IQ (P < .01). Neuropsychological assessment
   revealed lowers,. ores for the CHD group on the cognitive domains of
   Sensorimotor Functioning (P < .001), Language (P < .001). Attent-on and
   Executive Functioning (P < .05), and Memory (P < .05). Children with
   CHD displayed more impulsive test behavior than healthy peers. No
   differences on IQ or cognitive domains were found between the cyanotic
   and tire acyanotic CHD group.
   Conclusions Six to 12 years postoperatively, children with CHD display
   a neuropsychological profile with mainly mild motor deficits and subtle
   difficulties with language tasks. Attention/executive functioning and
   memory also appear involved but to a lesser degree. Long-term follow-up
   of children with surgically corrected CHD, even when hemodynamically
   successful, is warranted. as they are at risk for neurodevelopmental
   delay at school age.

AB Populations of Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Picoides minor) are
   decreasing in size, necessitating management strategies. However, data
   on the reproductive biology of this species are scarce. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the influence of timing of breeding and
   nestling diet on the reproductive success of the Lesser Spotted
   Woodpecker and thereby contribute to an understanding of the
   determinants influencing its reproductive success. During 6 study years
   between 1996-2003, we investigated various variables of reproductive
   success in a Lesser Spotted Woodpecker population in the Taunus low
   mountain range, Germany. We observed nestling feeding at breeding holes
   to assess the composition of nestling diet and how it changes during
   the season. Clutch size, number of fledglings as well as body mass of
   the nestlings declined with the start of egg laying. Pairs composed of
   individuals that had breed together in previous years started egg
   laying earlier than newly established pairs. Nestling diet consisted
   mainly of aphids, caterpillars, craneflies and wood-living larvae. The
   composition changed considerably within the breeding season in both
   early and late broods. However, early broods were provided with
   caterpillars more frequently, whereas late broods received
   wood-dwelling larvae more often. Our results suggest that Lesser
   Spotted Woodpeckers time their breeding so as to coincide with the
   early nestling stage with the highest availability of caterpillars,
   since this is the time of highest energy demand. Moreover, food
   availability declines during the breeding season, and the decline in
   reproductive performance seems to be an effect of this development.

   RECOMMENDATIONS; ASSOCIATION; DISABILITY; IMPACT; COSTS
AB Objective: The objective of this study is to assess the magnitude of
   health-related lost productivity relative to medical and pharmacy costs
   for four employers and assess the business implications of a
   'full-cost" approach to managing health. Methods: A database was
   developed by integrating medical and pharmacy claims data with employee
   self-report Productivity and health information collected through the
   Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ). Information collected
   on employer business measures were combined with this database to model
   health-related lost productivity. Results: 1) Health-related
   productivity costs were more than four times greater than medical and
   pharmacy costs. 2) The full cost of poor health is driven 1 different
   health conditions than those driving medical and pharmacy costs alone.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Integrated Population Health
   & Productivity Management should be built on a foundation of Integrated
   Population Health & Productivity Measurement. Therefore, employers
   would reveal a blueprint for action for their integrated health and
   productivity enhancement strategies by measuring the full health and
   productivity costs related to the burdens of illness and health risk in
   their population.

AB Technology already exists that would allow future optical networks to
   support automatic lightpath configuration in response to dynamic
   traffic demands. Given appropriate commercial drivers, it is possible
   to foresee carrier network operators migrating away from semipermanent
   provisioning to enable on-demand short-duration communications.
   However, with traditional lightpath reservation protocols, a portion of
   the lightpath is idly held during the signaling propagation phase,
   which can significantly reduce the lightpath bandwidth efficiency in
   large wavelength-division multiplexed backbones. This paper proposes a
   prebooking mechanism to improve the lightpath efficiency over
   traditional reactive two-way reservation protocols, consequently
   liberating network resources to support higher traffic loads. The
   prebooking mechanism predicts the time when the traffic will appear at
   the optical cross connects, and intelligently schedules the lightpath
   components such that resources are only consumed as necessary. We
   describe the proposed signaling procedure for both centralized and
   distributed control planes and analyze its performance. This paper also
   investigates the aggregated flow length characteristics with the
   self-similar incident traffic and examines the effects of traffic
   prediction on the blocking probability as well as the ability to
   support latency sensitive traffic in a wide-area environment.

AB This article brings together the market for products, the market for
   talent, and firms' organizational form. While the organizational design
   determines the allocation of blame and fame within the firm, the value
   of a good reputation depends on the market structure. Consequently, the
   market structure dictates the optimal organizational design. If
   competition becomes tougher and the market thicker, transparent firms
   decentralize while nontransparent firms concentrate control,
   transparency itself is improved, corporations switch from unitary to
   multidivisional form, and the turnover of managers increases. The model
   rationalizes recent trends in both executive pay and organizational
   design.

AB Beginning in the 1980s, concerns about the deleterious effects of
   synthetic pesticides have driven a significant Southeast Asian research
   and development effort directed towards alternative pest control
   strategies, including the use of microbial control agents. Despite this
   effort, use of microbial control agents has grown slowly in the region.
   This is the result of an interplay between internal factors such as
   economics, national research programs, farmer education, manufacturing
   capabilities and regulatory frameworks, and external factors such as
   the influence of neighboring countries (particularly China), the
   availability of competitive pest control products, import regulations
   on pesticide residues and the activities of donor agencies. The role of
   these factors in providing both incentives and barriers to the adoption
   of microbial control are explored, and examples of promising projects
   are examined as a means of pointing the way forward towards increased
   progress in the future. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE manufacturing; scheduling; capacity planning; shop floor control
AB Production management, in batch type manufacturing environment, is
   regarded by the current research community as a very complex task. This
   paper claims that the complexity is a result of the system approach
   where management performance relies on decisions made at a too early
   stage in the manufacturing process. Decisions are made and stored in
   company databases by engineers who are neither economists nor
   production planner's experts. This paper presents a new method where
   engineer's task is not to make decisions but rather to prepare a
   knowledge-based "road map". The road map method does introduce
   flexibility and dynamics in the manufacturing process and thus
   simplifies the decision making process in production planning. Each
   user will generate a routine that meets his/her needs at the time of
   needs by using KBMS CAPP. Thereby this method increases dramatically
   manufacturing efficiency.

   system engineering tool, is applied as a knowledge capture
   (acquisition) tool in a generic NPD process. The acquired knowledge
   (identified in the DSM) is provided in the form of Questionnaires,
   which are organized into five performance indicators of the
   organization namely 'Marketing', 'Technical', 'Financial', 'Resource
   Management', and 'Project Management'. Industrial application is
   carried out for knowledge validation. It is found form the application
   that the acquired knowledge helps NPD teams, managers and stakeholders
   to benchmark their NPD endeavor and select areas to focus their
   improvement efforts (up to 80% valid).

ID SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; SIMULATION; FLOW
AB The various hydraulic and environmental problems related to the
   accumulation of solids have recently drawn increasingly attention to
   deposits in the management of sewer systems. Among the mechanical and
   hydraulic devices used for deposit removal, hydraulic flushing gates
   have proved to be a cost-effective solution and have been adopted in
   several sewer networks. This paper reports the results of an
   investigation on the scouring performance of flushing waves produced by
   hydraulic flushing gates. A numerical model based on the De Saint
   Venant-Exner equations in dimensionless form was validated by using
   data derived from laboratory experiments and was then utilized in this
   investigation. Simulations were carried out considering various values
   of the dimensionless parameters involved in the analysis, in order to
   obtain indications for the design and positioning of flushing devices
   in sewer channels. The problem of optimal flushing frequency was also
   investigated.

AB A simple, precise and sensitive reverse-phase high performance liquid
   chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method has been developed for the
   quantitation of atorvastatin calcium simultaneously with ezetimibe in
   pharmaceutical formulations. Chromatographic separation was achieved on
   a 250 x 4.6 mm, 5 mu Hypersil (R) phenyl-2 column. Eluent was monitored
   by absorbance at 242 nm using a mixture of 0.1 M ammonium acetate (pH
   6.5) and acetonitrile in the ratio of 28:72 (v/v). Calibration plots
   were linear in the concentration range of 12-52 mu g mL-1 for both
   atorvastatin calcium and ezetimibe with correlation coefficient (R2)
   between 0.9966 and 0.9993. The total run time is less than 5 min. The
   proposed method was validated by testing its linearity, recovery,
   selectivity, repeatability and LOD/LOQ values and it was successfully
   employed for the determination of atorvastatin calcium and ezetimibe in
   pharmaceutical tablet formulations.

AB Signaling is the most commonly cited explanation for stock repurchases
   in the academic literature. Yet, there is little evidence on whether
   managers intentionally use repurchases as signaling devices. Using a
   firm's financial reporting behavior to infer managerial intent, we find
   evidence suggesting that managers intentionally use fixed-price
   repurchase tender offers to signal undervaluation. In contrast, we find
   no evidence that managers use Dutch-auction tender offers to signal
   undervaluation. Instead, firms engaging in Dutch-auction repurchases
   act as if they are trying to deflate their earnings prior to the
   repurchases to further reduce the repurchasing price. (c) 2007 Elsevier

AB A monitoring and evaluation program was undertaken, involving six
   different styles of evaluation to determine whether a low-cost, eight
   month education campaign that operated within a small commercial
   district was successful at changing people's behavior and reducing
   stormwater litter loads. This project also tested newly developed
   guidelines for monitoring and evaluating all types of nonstructural
   stormwater quality best management practices (BMPs). The project
   evaluated: the extent and quality of the campaign's implementation; the
   degree to which it changed the awareness, attitudes, self-reported
   behavior and actual behavior of merchants and the public;, and the
   nature of changes in stormwater litter loads. Overall, the education
   campaign produced mixed results, with the net result being modestly
   positive. Specifically, it was: unsuccessful at significantly
   influencing the knowledge or attitudes of merchants or the public;
   modestly successful at influencing the behavior of merchants and the
   public; and modestly successful at reducing litter loads in stormwater.
   At a theoretical level, the project highlights how using different
   'styles' of BMP evaluation can help to build a more complete picture of
   a BMP's performance. At a practical level, the project helped to
   improve the monitoring and evaluation guidelines and produced
   evidence-based design guidelines for future campaigns that aim to
   reduce littering in commercial areas. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background and Purpose: The use of stone baskets for repositioning of
   stones or removal of fragment in conjunction with ureterorenoscopy has
   become widespread. We tested the performance of the ACMI Sur-Catch NT,
   Bard Dimension, Boston Scientific Zero-tip, and Cook N-Circle in a pig
   kidney model of flexible ureterorenoscopy.
   Materials and Methods: Opening characteristics of the basket were
   measured with mechanical calipers at 1-mm increments and compared with
   published reports to ensure the tested baskets were representative. Pig
   kidneys were placed in a basin and the ureters secured with a suture to
   a weight for stability. Flexible renoscopy was performed using a 16F
   flexible cystonephroscope. An 8-mm calculus was placed in the lower
   pole. Using each of four designs, the time necessary to grasp the
   stone, time to release the stone, and total time to move a stone from
   the lower-pole calix to the upper-pole were recorded. Total time
   experiments were repeated six times with each basket by three surgeons
   for a total of 18 attempts, and catch-and-release experiments were
   repeated six times by four surgeons for a total of 24 attempts per
   basket.
   Results: The Sur-Catch was significantly slower for catch and release
   (P < 0.001) and total time; P < 0.05) compared with all other baskets.
   There were no differences between the other baskets in either catch,
   release, or total times. There was no difference between surgeons (P <
   0.0634) or between attempts one through six (P = 0.538).
   Conclusions: Baskets with added complexity of the wire configurations
   (Sur-Catch) or a deflectable-wire mechanism (Dimension) offer no
   advantages and may slow capture and release of stones.

AB With the introduction of a protein milk payment system in New Zealand
   in 1988, there was an influx of North American (NA) Holstein-Friesian
   (HF) genetics into New Zealand (NZ) dairy herds, leading to an increase
   in the average percentage of NA genetics in NZ HF cows-from 2% in 1980
   to 38% in 1999. Of interest has been the effect this change has had on
   farm profitability and on the management required for these animals, as
   well as the phenotypic changes that have occurred within the national
   herd under the breeding programs operated in NZ from 1970 to 1990. The
   objective of this study was to quantify differences in body dimensions,
   body weights, and puberty- related parameters among 3 strains of HF,
   representing animals of NZ origin representative of the genetics
   present in 1970 and 1990 and of NA origin with 1990s genetics. A total
   of 172 animals born in 1999 were compared. The strains were 1) NZ70, a
   strain of NZ Friesian (average 7% NA genetics) equivalent to
   high-genetic-merit (high Breeding Worth) cows farmed in the 1970s; 2)
   NZ90, a strain of HF of NZ origin (average 24% NA genetics) typical of
   the animals present in the 1990s; and 3) NA90, a strain of HF of NA
   origin (average of 91% NA genetics) typical of animals present in the
   1990s. The differences in BW among all strains were significant at 6
   and 12 mo of age. At 15 and 24 mo, the 2 NZ strains were significantly
   lighter than the NA90 animals. At 24 mo of age (i. e., prior to first
   calving), the NA90 strain animals (BW = 515 kg) were 22 and 34 kg
   heavier than the NZ90 and NZ70 strains. The body length of the NA90
   strain was greater than either of the 2 NZ strains; the differences
   among the NA90 strain and the 2NZ strains varied from 2 to 6 cm, with
   the differences generally being greater at older ages. The trend in
   heart girth difference among strains was similar to that observed for
   body length. The wither height of the NA90 animals was greater than
   that of the NZ strains by 1 to 7 cm, although there was no significant
   difference between the NA90 and NZ90 strains at birth. At puberty the
   NA90 heifers were 20 d older and 20 kg heavier than the NZ90 heifers,
   which in turn were 25 kg and 25 d older than the NZ70 heifers. The NA90
   strain had a heavier mature body weight, and their older age at puberty
   suggested either that they mature later or that, under pastoral
   conditions, their growth rate is limited by their inability to consume
   sufficient metabolizable energy as grazed pasture, with a consequent
   delay in puberty. Results from this study will be useful in revising
   target BW in growing heifers of different germplasm.

TI New perspectives on the roles of nutrition and metabolic priorities in

   HEALTH TRAITS
AB Management, nutrition, production, and genetics are the main reasons
   for the decline in fertility in the modern dairy cow. Selection for the
   single trait of milk production with little consideration for traits
   associated with reproduction in the modern dairy cow has produced an
   antagonistic relationship between milk yield and reproductive
   performance. The outcome is a multifactorial syndrome of subfertility
   during lactation; thus, to achieve a better understanding and derive a
   solution, it is necessary to integrate a range of disciplines,
   including genetics, nutrition, immunology, molecular biology,
   endocrinology, metabolic and reproductive physiology, and animal
   welfare. The common theme underlying the process is a link between
   nutritional and metabolic inputs that support complex interactions
   between the gonadotropic and somatotropic axes. Multiple hormonal and
   metabolic signals from the liver, pancreas, muscle, and adipose tissues
   act on brain centers regulating feed intake, energy balance, and
   metabolism. Among these signals, glucose, fatty acids, insulin-like
   growth factor-I, insulin, growth hormone, ghrelin, leptin, and perhaps
   myostatin appear to play key roles. Many of these factors are affected
   by changes in the somatotropic axis that are a consequence of, or are
   needed to support, high milk production. Ovarian tissues also respond
   directly to metabolic inputs, with consequences for folliculogenesis,
   steroidogenesis, and the development of the oocyte and embryo. Little
   doubt exists that appropriate nutritional management before and after
   calving is essential for successful reproduction. Changes in body
   composition are related to the processes that lead to ovulation,
   estrus, and conception. However, better indicators of body composition
   and measures of critical metabolites are required to form precise
   nutritional management guidelines to optimize reproductive outcomes.
   The eventual solution to the reduction in fertility will be a new
   strategic direction for genetic selection that includes
   fertility-related traits. However, this will take time to be effective,
   so, in the short term, we need to gain a greater understanding of the
   interactions between nutrition and fertility to better manage the
   issue. A greater understanding of the phenomenon will also provide
   markers for more targeted genetic selection. This review highlights
   many fruitful directions for research, aimed at the development of
   strategies for nutritional management of reproduction in the
   high-producing subfertile dairy cow.

AB Colostrum composition and management were surveyed via sample and data
   collection from 55 dairy farms in Pennsylvania. Colostrum samples were
   analyzed for fat, protein, lactose, total solids, ash, Ig, lactoferrin,
   water- and fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals. Mean percentages of fat,
   protein, and lactose in colostrum were 6.7, 14.9, and 2.5,
   respectively. Concentrations of IgG(1), IgG(2), IgA, IgM, and
   lactoferrin were 35.0, 6.0, 1.7, 4.3, and 0.8 mg/mL, respectively. Mean
   concentrations of fat-soluble vitamins, including retinol, tocopherol,
   and beta-carotene, were 4.9, 2.9, and 0.7 mu g/g, respectively. Mean
   concentrations of water- soluble vitamins were 0.34, 0.90, 4.55, 0.60,
   0.15, 0.21, and 0.04 mu g/mL for niacin, thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin
   B-12, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine, respectively. Mean
   concentrations (mg/kg) of selected minerals in colostrum were also
   determined (Ca 4,716; P 4,452; Mg 733; Na 1,058; K 2,845; Zn 38; Fe
   5.3; Cu 0.3; S 2,595; and Mn 0.1). The findings of this study revealed
   that the mean concentrations of most nutrients in colostrum have
   increased when compared with values previously reported. Results also
   showed that management practices have improved over time, particularly
   with regard to colostrum storage and feeding. Additionally, we observed
   that herd size influenced colostrum management and quality. It can be
   inferred, based on these findings, that although improvements have been
   made with regard to colostrum management and quality, there is still a
   need to educate producers on issues related to storage and timely
   feeding of colostrum to increase passive transfer and decrease the rate
   of calf morbidity and mortality.

AB The objective of this study was to compare 2 strategies for the
   management of dairy cows having retained fetal membranes (RFM) with
   regard to clinical traits, milk yield, and reproductive performance. In
   contrast to recent studies evaluating optimal strategies for the
   management of cows with RFM, this trial was conducted on small dairy
   farms with 26 to 166 cows per herd. In the systemic (SYS) group (n =
   116), cows having RFM and a rectal temperature >= 39.5 degrees C were
   treated with 1 mg/kg of body weight of ceftiofur on 3 to 5 consecutive
   days. The RFM cows without fever remained untreated. In the
   intrauterine (IUT) group (n = 115), all RFM cows received an
   intrauterine treatment with 6 g of tetracycline on 3 consecutive days
   combined with an attempt to remove the fetal membranes manually. The
   IUT cows with a fever received an additional systemic treatment with 10
   mg/kg of body weight of amoxicillin on 3 to 5 consecutive days. Body
   temperature, daily milk yield, prevalence of vaginal discharge 28 to 35
   d in milk (DIM), and reproductive performance traits within 200 DIM
   were monitored. The proportion of cows experiencing fever within 5 d
   after enrollment was greater in SYS compared with IUT. The proportion
   of cows with mucopurulent or purulent vaginal discharge 28 to 34 DIM
   did not differ between the groups. Furthermore, no significant
   differences between groups were found in daily milk yield in the first
   10 d after enrollment, or in reproductive performance or proportion of
   cows culled. Significant differences in the proportion of cows with a
   fever in SYS and IUT have not been reported in studies with similar
   study designs conducted on large dairy farms. Further results on milk
   yield and reproductive performance, however, support findings that a
   management strategy for RFM based on a selective systemic treatment of
   feverish cows is at least as efficacious as a strategy based on
   intrauterine treatments of all cows and a systemic antibiotic treatment
   of feverish cows.

AB Feeding practices, ration composition, and body condition scores (BCS)
   were assessed in an observational casecontrast study of Norwegian dairy
   herds with low (n = 98) and high (n = 94) mastitis infection rates.
   Differences between the 2 groups of herds were associated with feeding
   practices and amount of roughage. More herds in the low-infection group
   were fed a reduced amount of roughage at drying off, and reduced
   rations during the dry period resulted in lower BCS at calving. Cows in
   the low-infection herds had significantly lower BCS in the last month
   before calving and the first month of lactation than cows in the
   high-infection herds. The significant associations between mastitis
   infection rates and BCS, frequency of concentrate feeding, and amount
   of roughage at drying off and during the dry period indicated that
   feeding practices may have an important influence on the risk of
   mastitis in Norwegian dairy cows.

AB The objective of this study was to explore the derivation of a
   mathematical model that adequately describes the intercalving body
   condition score (BCS) profile in dairy cows and is robust and
   applicable to different animal cohorts. The data used to generate the
   function were 75,352 daily BCS records across 3,209 lactations in 1,172
   cows from a research herd in New Zealand. Mean daily BCS (scale 1 to
   10) across all data were plotted and 4 distinct phases were observed.
   The functional form used to describe the pattern and quantify its
   features comprised the sum of the 4 phase functions created from
   intercepts, rates of change, approximate timing of phase transition
   points, and the sharpness of these transition points in the BCS
   profile. The generality and applicability of the described model were
   tested across substrata of BCS at calving and parity. A second data set
   consisting of a multiyear study comparing cows fed a total mixed ration
   (TMR) or grazing fresh pasture was compiled from a different research
   farm. This data set consisted of 4,112 BCS records from 211 lactations
   on 95 cows. The third data set was a collation of data from another
   multiyear experiment comparing animal performance under different
   stocking rates. The data set consisted of 12,414 BCS test-day records
   on 564 lactations from 287 cows. The presented model is robust and
   applicable to different animal cohorts, explaining between 29 and 79%
   of variation depending on the cohort studied. Anotable second period of
   negative energy balance was evident in all grazing cows during
   midlactation, irrespective of calving BCS, parity, or stocking rate,
   but did not appear in cows fed TMR. The amount of BCS lost postcalving
   and nadir BCS were positively correlated with calving BCS, with fatter
   cows at calving losing more BCS postcalving but remaining at a greater
   BCS at nadir. Primiparous cows calved at a greater BCS than multiparous
   cows, as dictated by management protocols, but they failed to regain
   BCS postnadir as effectively as their multiparous counterparts. Results
   may highlight the need for preferential feeding of younger cows during
   late lactation, at least in grazing systems, to ensure that they
   achieve the required calving BCS at second calving. Cows receiving TMR
   lost BCS at a slower rate than cows on pasture but for a longer period;
   the amount of BCS lost between calving and nadir did not differ between
   the different feeding treatments. Calving BCS declined with increasing
   stocking rate, and the rates of both loss and gain were negatively
   affected by stocking rate. The presented model accurately identified
   biological attributes of the intercalving BCS profile of different
   groups of cows.

AB The aims of this study were 1) to explore different motivating factors
   and to quantify their importance in decisions of farmers on improving
   mastitis management, 2) to evaluate different quality payment schemes
   as extra incentive mechanisms for farmers, and 3) to link the
   motivating factors to farmer characteristics. Data on characteristics
   of farmers were obtained through a traditional paper-based
   questionnaire (n = 100). Data on the factors motivating farmers to
   improve mastitis management were collected in a computer-interactive
   mode. Adaptive conjoint analysis was used to investigate perceptions of
   farmers of the importance of factors. Factors that are internal to the
   farm performance and the individual farmer provided more motivation
   than external factors implying esteem and awareness of the whole dairy
   sector performance. Internal nonmonetary factors relating to internal
   esteem and taking pleasure in healthy animals on the farm were equally
   motivating as monetary factors affecting farm economic performance. The
   identified difference in perceptions of farmers of importance of extra
   financial incentive based on bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC)
   depending on whether farmers think in terms of quality premium or
   penalty for a lower and a higher BMSCC, respectively, suggested that
   farmers are expected to be more motivated by a price decrease for milk
   with a greater BMSCC than by a price increase for milk with a lower
   BMSCC. In this respect, quality penalties were found to be more
   effective in motivating farmers than quality premiums. Two-stage
   cluster analysis of individual perceptions resulted in 3 distinct
   clusters according to motivation of farmers: premium-or
   penalty-oriented motivation, motivation to have an efficient
   (well-organized) farm that easily complies with regulatory
   requirements, and basic economic motivation. The obtained results
   highlight possible areas of improvement in incentive and educational
   programs aimed at improving mastitis management.

TI Performance evaluating model for construction companies: Egyptian case
   study
SO JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID BUSINESS FAILURE; PREDICTORS; INDUSTRY
AB The dynamic nature of today's construction industry compels
   construction partners to seek strategies in order to improve
   performance. Current research introduces a performance evaluation model
   for construction companies in order to provide a proper tool for a
   company's managers, owners, shareholders, and funding agencies to
   evaluate the performance of construction companies. The model developed
   helps a company's management to make the right decisions. Financial,
   economical, and industrial data are collected from Egyptian
   construction companies for nine consecutive years (1992-2000). Five
   indices (models) are developed: company performance score, economy
   performance score, industry performance score, performance index, and
   performance grade. The models developed consider companies in four
   construction sectors: general building, heavy, special trade, and real
   estate. These models accommodate the effect of macroeconomic and
   industry related factors and company size on the performance
   evaluation. The final outcome of current research is a performance
   grade, which provides the performance of a construction company. The
   developed model is validated, which shows robust results.

TI Job performance dimensions for improving final project outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTEXTUAL PERFORMANCE; ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT; TASK-PERFORMANCE;
   APPRAISAL; SELECTION; CONFLICT; BEHAVIOR; RATINGS; CURVES; MODEL
AB Job performance is argued to be substantially influential to project
   performance. However, existing construction management literature pays
   less attention to job performance issues, not to mention exploring the
   relationship between job performance and project performance. This
   study therefore aims at examining the effects of job performance on
   project performance. Four categories (task, behavior, management, and
   self) of job performance dimensions were extracted by means of an
   exploratory factor analysis. A hypothesized model is developed, which
   specifies the relationships between the four job performance categories
   (independent variables) and overall project performance (the dependent
   variable). The model was tested using path analysis. Results indicate
   that the task category of job performance (consisting of nine
   dimensions) is significantly related to final project outcomes.
   Specifically, for the success of a project, a construction company must
   consider how to ensure employees are equipped with such attributes as
   responsibility, quality of work, ability, job knowledge, experience,
   efficiency, accuracy, judgment, and initiative.

TI Magnetic resonance imaging of the axial skeleton for detecting bone

   cost-effectiveness and comparison with current detection strategies
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID WHOLE-BODY MRI; BREAST-CANCER; SPINAL METASTASES; SOLID TUMORS; FDG
   PET; SCINTIGRAPHY; MARROW; LESIONS; SCAN; CT
AB Purpose
   To evaluate the diagnostic performance, costs, and impact on therapy of
   one-step magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) of the axial skeleton (
   MRIas) for detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk
   prostate cancer ( PCa).
   Patients and Methods
   Sixty-six consecutive patients with high-risk PCa prospectively
   underwent MRIas in addition to the standard sequential work-up ( SW) of
   bone metastases ( technetium-99m bone scintigraphy [ BS] completed with
   targeted x-rays [ TXR] in patients with equivocal BS findings and with
   MRI obtained on request [ MRIor] in patients with inconclusive BS/ TXR
   findings). Panel review of initial and 6-month follow-up MRI findings,
   BS/ TXR, and all available baseline and follow-up clinical and biologic
   data were used as the best valuable comparator to define metastatic
   status. Diagnostic effectiveness of MRIas alone was compared with each
   step of the SW. Impact of MRIas screening on patient management and
   costs was evaluated.
   Results
   On the basis of the best valuable comparator, 41 patients ( 62%) had
   bone metastases. Sensitivities were 46% for BS alone, 63% for BS/ TXR,
   83% for BS/ TXR/ MRIor, and 100% for MRIas; the corresponding
   specificities were 32%, 64%, 100%, and 88%, respectively. MRIas was
   significantly more sensitive than any other approach ( P < .05,
   McNemar). MRIas identified metastases in seven ( 30%) of 23 patients
   considered negative and eight ( 47%) of 17 patients considered
   equivocal by other strategies, which altered the initially planned
   therapy. Economic impact was variable among countries, depending on
   reimbursement rates.
   Conclusion
   MRIas is more sensitive than the current SW of radiographically
   identified bone metastases in high-risk PCa patients, which impacts the
   clinical management of a significant proportion of patients.

AB Angus-crossbred steers (n = 216) were used in a 3-yr study to assess
   the effects of winter stocker growth rate and finishing system on
   finishing performance and carcass characteristics. During winter months
   (December to April) steers were randomly allotted to 3 stocker growth
   rates: low (0.23 kgmental unit, and year was considered a random
   effect. Winter stocker phase treatments resulted in differences (P <
   0.001) in final BW, ADG, and ultrasound LM area between all treatments
   for that phase. Pasture-finished cattle had lower (P < 0.001) final BW,
   ADG, HCW, LM area, fat thickness, KPH, dressing percent, USDA yield
   grade, and USDA quality grade. Winter stocker treatment influenced (P <
   0.05) final BW and HCW, with low and medium being less than high.
   Steers with low stocker gain had greater (P < 0.05) finishing ADG.
   Dressing percent was greater (P < 0.001) for high than low, and USDA
   quality grade was greater (P < 0.05) for high than low and medium.
   Carcass LM area, fat thickness, KPH, and USDA yield grade were not
   influenced (P > 0.05) by winter rate of gain. Cattle on low during
   winter exhibited compensatory gain during finishing but were unable to
   catch the high group regarding BW or HCW. The USDA quality grade was
   greater for high than low or medium. Animal performance during the
   winter stocker period clearly impacts finishing performance, carcass
   quality and beef production in both pasture-and feedlot-finishing
   systems, when cattle were finished to an equal-time endpoint.center dot
   d(-1)), medium (0.45 kg center dot d(-1)), or high (0.68 kg center dot
   d(-)1). Upon completion of the winter phase, steers were randomly
   allotted within each stocker treatment to a corn silage-concentrate or
   pasture finishing system. All steers regardless of finishing treatment
   were finished to an equal-time endpoint to eliminate confounding of
   treatments with animal age or seasonal factors. Upon completion of the
   finishing period, steers were slaughtered in 2 groups (one-half of
   pasture and one-half of feedlot cattle each time) and carcass data were
   collected. Winter data were analyzed as a completely randomized design,
   with winter treatment, pen replicate, year, and the winter x year
   interaction in the model. Finishing performance and carcass data were
   analyzed in a split-plot design with finishing system in the whole
   plot, and winter growth rate and winter x finish in the split-plot.
   Winter treatment mean within finishing replication was the experimental
   unit, and year was considered a random effect. Winter stocker phase
   treatments resulted in differences (P < 0.001) in final BW, ADG, and
   ultrasound LM area between all treatments for that phase.
   Pasture-finished cattle had lower (P < 0.001) final BW, ADG, HCW, LM
   area, fat thickness, KPH, dressing percent, USDA yield grade, and USDA
   quality grade. Winter stocker treatment influenced (P < 0.05) final BW
   and HCW, with low and medium being less than high. Steers with low
   stocker gain had greater (P < 0.05) finishing ADG. Dressing percent was
   greater (P < 0.001) for high than low, and USDA quality grade was
   greater (P < 0.05) for high than low and medium. Carcass LM area, fat
   thickness, KPH, and USDA yield grade were not influenced (P > 0.05) by
   winter rate of gain. Cattle on low during winter exhibited compensatory
   gain during finishing but were unable to catch the high group regarding
   BW or HCW. The USDA quality grade was greater for high than low or
   medium.
   Animal performance during the winter stocker period clearly impacts
   finishing performance, carcass quality and beef productin in both
   pasture- and feedlot-finishing systems, when cattle were finished to an
   equal-time endpoint.

TI Effects of frequent out-of-feed events on growth performance of nursery
   and grow-finish pigs
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE

DE feed availability; feed management; pig
ID BODY-COMPOSITION; RESTRICTION; PERIOD
AB Two experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of out-of-feed
   events on nursery and grow-finish pig performance. An out-of-feed event
   is a period of time that pigs do not have access to feed as a result of
   late feed delivery or bridging in bulk bins, feed lines, or feeders. In
   these studies, we created an out-of-feed event by removing the feeders
   from pens or preventing access to the feeder. In Exp. 1, 190 pigs
   (initially 6.4 +/- 1.6 kg and 21 +/- 3 d of age) were used in a 35-d
   growth study. Treatments involved a 20-h feed withdrawal for 1, 2, or 3
   randomly selected times or a control treatment where feeders were never
   withdrawn. Feeders were withdrawn on d 11 for pigs with 1 out-of-feed
   event, d 8 and 23 for pigs with 2 out-of-feed events, and d 9, 14, and
   20 for pigs with 3 out-of-feed events. There was a treatment (P < 0.06)
   effect only during weeks in which an out-of-feed event occurred. Growth
   rate was lower ( P < 0.05) for pigs with 1 out-of-feed event (d 11)
   compared with control in the d 8 to 14 period. During the same period,
   those pigs with the first of 2 ( 8) or 3 (d 9) out-of-feed events had
   intermediate ADG. In the d 15 to 21 period, only pigs with the second
   and third of 3 out-of-feed events (d 15 and 20) had lower growth
   performance compared with control pigs, whereas growth performance was
   similar to the control for those with 1 or 2 out-of-feed events. Pigs
   with 3 out-of-feed events had greater ADG and G:F (P < 0.05) compared
   with the other 3 treatments for the d 22 to 28 period. For the overall
   study ( d 0 to 35), there were no differences (P > 0.86) in growth
   performance among pigs with 0, 1, 2, or 3 out-of-feed events. In Exp.
   2, 479 pigs ( initially 41.6 +/- 4 kg) were used in an 85-d growth
   study. Treatments involved feed withdrawal (20 h) weekly for the
   duration of the study; feed withdrawn weekly from d 45 to 85; or a
   control treatment where pigs had access to feed for the duration of the
   experiment. Feed withdrawal occurred on a randomly selected day with
   the exception of Saturday, Sunday, or a day before a weigh day (
   usually a Thursday every other week). From d 0 to 45, 46 to 85, and the
   overall d 0 to 85 period, there were no differences ( P > 0.12) in ADG,
   ADFI, G: F, or average final BW among treatments. Results suggest that
   out of feed events of 20 h or less have no long-term detrimental
   effects on growth performance in nursery or grow-finish pigs.

AB A 3-yr study was conducted to evaluate the effects of calving system,
   weaning age, and postweaning management on growth and reproduction in
   beef heifers. Heifer calves (n = 676) born in late winter (average
   birth date = February 7 +/- 9 d) or early spring (average birth date
   April 3 +/- 10 d) were weaned at 190 or 240 d of age, and heifers born
   in late spring (average birth date May 29 +/- 10 d) were weaned at 140
   or 190 d of age. Heifers were managed to be first exposed to breeding
   at approximately 14 mo of age. After weaning, the calves were randomly
   assigned to treatments. Heifers on the constant gain treatment were fed
   a corn silage- and hay-based diet. Heifers on delayed gain treatments
   were placed on pasture but were fed grass hay or a supplement, or both,
   depending on the forage conditions. Three months before their
   respective breeding seasons, delayed gain heifers were moved to drylot
   and fed a corn silage- and barley-based diet (late winter or early
   spring) or moved to spring rangeland (late spring). The data were
   analyzed using mixed model procedures with calving system, weaning age,
   and postweaning management options creating 12 treatments. Average
   daily gain was 0.36 +/- 0.05 (SED) kg/d less (P < 0.001) for delayed
   gain heifers during the initial phase, whereas these heifers gained
   0.44 +/- 0.03 kg/d more (P < 0.001) than constant gain heifers during
   the last 90 d before breeding. Body weights at the beginning of the
   breeding season did not differ (P = 0.97) between constant gain and
   delayed gain heifers but were affected by calving system and weaning
   age, reflecting some of the differences in initial BW. Prebreeding BW
   for heifers weaned at 190 d of age were 36 +/- 6.4 kg heavier (P <
   0.001) for those born in late winter and early spring compared with
   late spring and were 388, 372, and 330 kg for heifers weaned in October
   at 240, 190, or 140 d of age (linear effect, P < 0.001). The proportion
   of heifers exhibiting luteal activity at the beginning of the breeding
   season was not affected (P = 0.57) by treatment. Approximately half of
   the heifers were randomly selected for breeding. Treatment had no
   effect (P = 0.64) on pregnancy rates. In conclusion, heifers from
   varied calving systems and weaning strategies can be raised to breeding
   using either constant or delayed gain strategies without affecting the
   percentage of heifers cycling at the beginning of the breeding season.
   These results suggest that producers have multiple options for
   management of heifer calves within differing calving systems.

AB A bioeconomic computer model was used to evaluate alternate calving
   seasons in a cow-calf enterprise under range conditions representative
   of the Northern Great Plains. The simulated ranch utilized a rotational
   breeding system based on Hereford and Angus and had a fixed forage base
   ( 4,500 animal unit months of native range, 520 t of grass hay, and 183
   t of alfalfa hay). Calving seasons studied were spring (SP, beginning
   March 15), summer (SU, beginning May 15), and fall ( FA, beginning
   August 15). Weaning dates were October 31, December 15, and February 1,
   for SP, SU, and FA. The SP system was also simulated with a 5% increase
   in calf mortality (SP-IM), and SU with early weaning on October 31
   (SU-EW). Herd size for the fixed resource was 509, 523, 519, 560, and
   609 cows exposed per year for SP, SP-IM, SU, SU-EW, and FA,
   respectively. Corresponding values for weight weaned per cow exposed
   were 206, 186, 193, 153, and 145 kg. Steer calves, nonreplacement
   heifer calves, and cull cows were sold at the time of weaning.
   Quarterly cattle and feed prices used were representative of the peak,
   descending, valley, and ascending phases of the 1990s cattle cycle
   adjusted for inflation. Estimates of ranch gross margin ( gross returns
   minus variable costs) were greatest for SP, followed by SP-IM, SU,
   SU-EW, and FA, and the ranks were consistent across phases of the
   cattle cycle. Differences between ranch gross margin for SP-IM and SU
   were small. In beef enterprises representative of the Northern Great
   Plains, with a restricted grazing season, limited access to low-cost,
   high-quality grazeable forage, and with calves sold at weaning,
   switching from early spring to a summer or fall calving date is not
   expected to improve profitability. If delaying calving improves calf
   survival, then calving in early summer may be a competitive choice.

AB Fifteen indigenous nondescript kids (8 center dot 2 kg; 8 months
   initial age), randomly allotted into three equal groups, were used to
   study the effects of supplementation of extra iodine on their
   performance when fed a leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal
   containing diet. Group I (CON) was fed a control concentrate supplement
   consisting of a conventional protein source whereas the other two
   groups (LL and LLI) were fed a concentrate containing leucaena leaf
   meal so as to supply 0 center dot 5 of the net crude protein (CP)
   requirements. Additionally, animals in group LLI were given
   supplemental iodine (as potassium iodide solution) at 0 center dot 25
   mg/head/day. Wheat straw was provided ad libitum as the sole source of
   roughage during the 120 days of the experimental period. A metabolism
   trial, conducted at the end of the feeding trial, revealed no variation
   in the dry matter intake (DMI) among the groups. A significant (P<0
   center dot 01) decline was evident in digestibility of CP in both the
   leucaena-fed groups (0 center dot 463 and 0 center dot 482 versus 0
   center dot 586) whilst that of the other organic components remained
   unaffected. Animals on the LL diet exhibited lower (P<0-01) nitrogen
   retention and average daily gain (ADG) in live weight (LW). Blood
   collected periodically was analysed for the thyroid hormones
   triiodothyronine (TO and thyroxine (T-4) as well as other biochemical
   parameters. At the end of the experimental feeding, the cell-mediated
   immune (CMI) response of the goats was assessed by intra-dermal
   inoculation of phytohaemagglutinin-P and measuring the change in skin
   thickness at various postinoculation hours. The results revealed that
   the serum concentration of glucose was significantly (P<0 center dot
   05) higher in the LLI group of animals fed leucaena with iodine. The
   concentration of cholesterol in serum of LL animals increased
   significantly (P<0 center dot 05) compared to the CON and LLI groups.
   No variation due to dietary interventions was evident in other indices
   of metabolic profile. While the concentration of circulating T-3
   remained unaffected due to dietary intervention, that of T4 reduced
   significantly (P<0 center dot 05) in the LL group. Moreover, the T4
   concentration in the LLI group remained similar to that of control
   indicative of positive impact of iodine supplementation. The immune
   response revealed that the skin thickness of animals in the LL group
   was lower (P < 0 center dot 05) as compared to the control, indicating
   a compromise of CMI response due to feeding of leucaena leaf meal.
   Supplementation of iodine appeared to be partially effective in
   potentiating the response. In conclusion, iodine supplementation could
   be adopted as a strategic management strategy to ameliorate the
   negative impacts of feeding leucaena leaf meal in growing kids.

AB Objectives: Point-of-care (POC) anticoagulation testing devices can
   potentially improve warfarin therapeutics in long-term care; however,
   there is variable accuracy reported for these devices and scant data
   when used in older adults. Accordingly, we undertook this study to
   determine the accuracy of a POC device (Hemosense IN-ratio) in
   long-term care settings and examine factors associated with discrepant
   results.
   Design: Case series.
   Setting: Two, demographically comparable continuing-care retirement
   communities in the Southeastern United States.
   Participants: Long-term (nursing home and assisted living) residents
   with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, or prior
   cerebrovascular accident (16 at site 1; 8 at site 2).
   Measurements: INR results calculated by the Hemosense device were
   compared with those determined by venipuncture-collected samples run in
   commercial laboratories. Patient demographic and clinical data were
   collected, as was performance by tester.
   Results: Correlation varied between sites and, at site 1, between
   testers. Accuracy at site 1 was comparable to published reports for 2
   of the 3 testers, with rather disconcerting discrepancy rates of 17.8%
   and 23.1%. However, correlation for the third tester was much better,
   with only a 7% discrepancy rate based on clinician rating of
   Hemosense-Reference lab differences. Correlation at site 2 was
   considerably worse than site 1, to the point that the Hemosense could
   not be safely adopted.
   Conclusion: POC devices may not be appropriate for commercial
   laboratory tests substitution without prior performance evaluation.
   Running POC lNRs concurrent with laboratory-determined INRS can
   determine test reliability. Timing of Hemosense testing in relation to
   when laboratory INRs were drawn is one likely explanation for our
   results, although user differences may also contribute significantly.
   Further research in larger, more diverse populations, using a variety
   of POC devices, and with direct comparison of older and younger
   patients is needed.

TI Heavy flow-based incident detection algorithm using information from

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE freeway incident detection; freeway traffic management; intelligent
   transport systems
ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB In heavy traffic flow conditions, vehicles have limited manouverability
   which affects the magnitude of response to incident-induced traffic
   disturbances and how fast changes in these traffic variables can signal
   the occurrence of an incident. Such characteristics are usually used to
   formulate a loop-based algorithm. A recent study reported that some
   existing algorithms were not able to maintain a desired level of
   effectiveness when these algorithms were used to detect incidents with
   a video-based detector system. Two new video-based automatic incident
   detection algorithms, the INdividual Detection Evaluation (INDE) and
   COmbined Detection Evaluation ( CODE) algorithms were, therefore,
   developed for the detection of lane-blocking incidents in heavy traffic
   flow conditions using the Central Expressway in Singapore as a case
   study. The algorithms detect incident-induced traffic speed and
   occupancy disturbances differently: INDE processes information at each
   individual detector station and CODE processes information at two
   adjacent detector stations. Both algorithms outperformed existing
   algorithms commonly used in incident management systems. Of these
   algorithms, the INDE algorithm raised fewer false alarms and gave
   slightly faster incident warnings. However, its performance was
   relatively less consistent when applied to a validation database.

AB PURPOSE: Breathing pattern retraining is frequently used for exertional
   dyspnea relief in adults with moderate to severe chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease. However, there is contradictory evidence to support
   its use. The study objective was to compare 2 programs of prolonging
   expiratory time (pursed-lips breathing and expiratory muscle training)
   on dyspnea and functional performance.
   METHODS: A randomized, controlled design was used for the pilot study.
   Subjects recruited from the outpatient pulmonary clinic of a
   university-affiliated Veteran Affairs healthcare center were randomized
   to: 1) pursed-lips breathing, 2) expiratory muscle training, or 3)
   control. Changes over time in dyspnea [modified Borg after 6-minute
   walk distance (6MWD) and Shortness of Breath Questionnaire] and
   functional performance (Human Activity Profile and physical function
   scale of Short Form 36-item Health Survey) were assessed with a
   multilevel modeling procedure. Weekly laboratory visits for training
   were accompanied by structured verbal, written, and audiovisual
   instruction.
   RESULTS: Forty subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [age
   = 65 +/- 9 (mean +/- standard deviation) years, forced expiratory
   volume 1 second/ forced vital capacity % = 46 +/- 10, forced expiratory
   volume 1 second % predicted = 39 +/- 13, body mass index = 26 +/- 6
   kg/M-2, inspiratory muscle strength = 69 +/- 22 cm H2O, and expiratory
   muscle strength (PEmax) = 102 +/- 29 cm H2O] were enrolled. No
   significant Group x Time difference was present for PEmax (P = .93).
   Significant reductions for the modified Borg scale after 6MWD (P = .05)
   and physical function (P = .02) from baseline to 12 weeks were only
   present for pursed-lips breathing.
   CONCLUSION: Pursed-lips breathing provided sustained improvement in
   exertional dyspnea and physical function.

TI Errors in predicting furrow irrigation performance using single

SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE

ID REAL-TIME; PARAMETERS; MANAGEMENT; ADVANCE; OPTIMIZATION; EQUATIONS;
   MODEL
AB Commercial performance evaluations of surface irrigation are commonly
   conducted using infiltration functions obtained at a single inflow
   rate. However, evaluations of alternative irrigation management (e.g.
   flow rate, cut-off strategy) and design (e.g. field length) options
   using simulation models often rely on this single measured infiltration
   function, raising concerns over the accuracy of the predicted
   performance improvements. Measured field data obtained from 12
   combinations of inflow rate and slope over two irrigations were used to
   investigate the accuracy of simulated surface irrigation performance
   due to changes in the infiltration. Substantial errors in performance
   prediction were identified due to (a) infiltration differences at
   various inflow rates and slopes and (b) the method of specifying the
   irrigation cut-off. Where the irrigation cut-off at various inflow
   rates was specified as a fixed time identified from simulations using
   the infiltration measured at a single inflow rate, then the predicted
   application efficiency was generally well correlated with the
   application efficiency measured under field conditions at the various
   inflow rates. However, the predictions of distribution uniformity (DU)
   were poor. Conversely, specifying the irrigation cut-off as a function
   of water advance distance resulted in adequate predictions of DU but
   poor predictions of application efficiency. Adjusting the infiltration
   function for the change in wetted perimeter at different inflow rates
   improved the accuracy of the performance predictions and substantially
   reduced the error in performance prediction associated with the cut-off
   recommendation strategy.

AB The performance of different indicators of plant water status as a tool
   for irrigation management was evaluated in mature field grown 'Golden
   Delicious' apple trees during the late summer of 1998. Control (C) and
   stress (S) treatments were studied. In the C treatment trees were
   irrigated daily at 100% ETc whereas in the S treatment water was
   withheld during 31 days (DOY's 236-266). Predawn water potential
   (Psi(pd)) and midday stem water potential (Psi(stem)) were measured
   several times a week during the experimental period. Three daily
   measurements of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and stem water potential
   were made during five consecutive days in mid-September. Trunk diameter
   changes (TDC) were recorded by LVDT sensors, and from these
   measurements, maximum daily shrinkage (MDS), daily growth (DG), and
   cumulative growth (CG) were calculated. Midday Psi(stem) showed the
   best ratio between the response to moderate water stress and tree
   variability ("signal/noise" ratio) among the indicators studied here,
   followed closely by Psi(pd). On the other hand, the poorest water
   status indicator was g(s). Due to the low trunk growth rate of the
   trees, and its high variability, DG and CG were not adequate
   indicators. MDS showed a lower sensitivity to water stress and a higher
   variability (CV = 0.19) than midday Psi(stem) (CV = 0.08) and Psi(pd)
   (CV = 0.10). However, MDS correlated well with ET0 and with midday
   Psi(stem) (R 2= 0.79) thus, making this parameter an interesting and
   promising tool for irrigation management in apple orchards. More
   research needs to be done in order to define reference values for MDS
   and plant water potential indicators, in relation to evaporative
   conditions and in different phenological periods, and to quantify the
   relationship between water status indicators values and apple tree
   yield and fruit quality.

AB Performance of WATCOM (a numerical model) and CRPSM (a simple water
   balance model) were assessed in simulating root zone water storage and
   water balance components under cowpea in Nigeria using a line source
   sprinkler system. Three sets of field data were collected: the first
   was used for calibration and model parameters' estimation and the other
   two for testing and comparisons. The simulated soil water storage and
   crop evapotranspiration with WATCOM and CRPSM were in good agreement
   with field-measured data though WATCOM performed significantly better
   (P < 0.05) under the stressed condition. The maximum average error
   between predicted and measured soil water storage was -0.95 and +1.47
   mm for WATCOM and CRPSM, respectively, while that between measured and
   predicted actual crop evapotranspiration was +2.7 and +11.38 mm,
   respectively, for the two models. WATCOM gave generally higher
   cumulative deep percolation and lower evapotranspiration than that of
   CRPSM for all irrigation levels (P < 0.05), and values of deep
   percolation for WATCOM were in better agreement with field data than
   that of CRPSM. This suggests that drainage below the field capacity
   needs to be included in CRPSM and that WATCOM will be a more useful
   management tool when detailed soil parameter is required and under
   variable water regime.

TI Performance management in the Baltic States and Russia: success against
   the odds?
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Latvia; Lithuania; public management reforms; Russia
AB This article analyses the public management reform process in Latvia,
   Lithuania and Russia, the only three post-Communist states that have
   sought to introduce comprehensive performance management systems in the
   public sector. The central premise of the article is that the
   introduction of such reforms can be successful even in public
   management systems that are not 'advanced'. This contradicts the widely
   held notion that performance-based public management systems are not
   suitable for 'developing' countries. The article concludes that if
   sufficient political support and a dedicated reform team in the civil
   service are present, and performance management systems are introduced
   in a step-by-step manner, significant improvement in the effectiveness
   and efficiency of public management systems can be achieved. The case
   of the two Baltic States studied in the article, which moved from being
   laggards in the EU accession process to among its best performing
   members, provides a strong argument that a more radical approach to
   public management reform can pay off, even in public management systems
   in development.

ID PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNMENT
AB Politicians have displayed a keen interest in the build-up of
   regulations and bureaucracies for quite some time now. A case in point
   is the Netherlands. The second Balkenende cabinet, though, vowed to
   downsize the number of rules as one of its main policy initiatives.
   Evaluating the success of such a policy requires the measurement of
   changes in rule volumes. Doing so is no easy task. Using higher
   education legislation as a case study, this article attempts to chart
   and explain developments in regulation volumes for the period
   1986-2004. For the time being, there appears to be no evidence that
   rule levels are on the decline in fact, the reverse is the case. We
   also provide evidence for a so-called ecology of law, suggesting that
   the rules-breed-rules mechanism is difficult to put to a halt.

AB To coordinate action, reduce bureaucratic in-fighting and favour the
   efficient implementation of the governmental agenda, governments are
   tending to use more collaborative and holistic tools. In Canada, within
   the federal and provincial governments, relatively integrated corporate
   management tools have been established for senior civil servants and
   their work. On the basis of interviews and discussions, this article
   presents the three types of tools used (a senior personnel secretariat
   reporting to the head of government, an integrated organizational
   system and the development of a community culture), which provide: a
   framework for the development, orientation, integration and support for
   the most senior managers; strategic, coordination and learning meetings
   for the entire group; and individualized HRM tools. Despite obstacles
   to it, and its risks, all of those surveyed conclude that this model is
   considered, in the Canadian context, both effective and satisfactory.

AB Lightweight metallic truss structures are currently being investigated
   for use within sandwich panel construction. These new material systems
   have demonstrated superior mechanical performance and are able to
   perform additional functions, such as thermal management and energy
   amelioration. The subject of this paper is an examination of the
   mechanical response of these structures. In particular, the retention
   of their stiffness and load capacity in the presence of imperfections
   is a central consideration, especially if they are to be used for a
   wide range of structural applications. To address this issue, sandwich
   panels with pyramidal truss cores have been tested in compression and
   shear, following the introduction of imperfections. These imperfections
   take the form of unbound nodes between the core and face sheets-a
   potential flaw that can occur during the fabrication process of these
   sandwich panels. Initial testing of small scale samples in compression
   provided insight into the influence of the number of unbound nodes but
   more importantly highlighted the impact of the spatial configuration of
   these imperfect nodes. Large scale samples, where bulk properties are
   observed and edge effects minimized, have been tested. The stiffness
   response has been compared with finite element simulations for a
   variety of unbound node configurations. Results for fully bound cores
   have also been compared to existing analytical predictions.
   Experimentally determined collapse strengths are also reported. Due to
   the influence of the spatial configuration of unbound nodes, upper and
   lower limits on stiffness and strength have been determined for
   compression and shear. Results show that pyramidal core sandwich
   structures are robust under compressive loading. However, the
   introduction of these imperfections causes rapid degradation of core
   shear properties. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge transfer constitutes a strategic area of knowledge management
   research. However, little is known about the circumstances under which
   one particular mechanism is the most appropriate and the other one is
   not. To address these issues, the present study reports the result from
   a large multinational corporation involved in software development.
   This paper yields some very interesting findings concerning knowledge
   transfer mechanisms in a real-world setting, investigating why its
   software engineers employ one mechanism than the other. The findings
   imply that the three key variables, namely status, personal ties, and
   proximity, act as a powerful force in exploring an appropriate
   knowledge transfer mechanism, which based on case evidence leads to an
   interesting decision tree of media user for different transfer
   situations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent decades an important set of articles on management has
   focused upon the marketing concept and the related construct of market
   orientation. The next challenge is to understand how this
   organizational orientation can be achieved and maintained. Using data
   from 451 companies and through structural equation models, this study
   considers that organizational learning represents the capacity of a
   company to move from a given situation to another desired situation of
   market orientation and performance. The results suggest that the
   influence of market orientation on performance is only significant when
   it is mediated by organizational learning. The results also indicate
   that organizational learning has a positive effect on performance. (c)

AB Traditionally, buying center research in business marketing has long
   focused on the role of various buying center members, including users,
   in influencing purchasing decisions. Recent studies have also
   established the important role users play in successfully implementing
   information technology (IT) initiatives of buying organizations and its
   influence on future relationships with sellers. Consequently, in order
   to ensure future business, marketers need users to evaluate their
   solutions favorably. This study attempts to understand the factors
   influencing user evaluation of performance of sellers' IT solutions.
   Based on an inter-disciplinary approach, a model of antecedent factors
   to explain user evaluation of suppliers IT solutions is proposed and
   tested. Results gleaned from a survey of 361 users of Internet-based
   technology in an automotive supply chain indicate that user attitudes
   toward technology, satisfaction with the new technology, users' overall
   understanding of supply chain management principles, and job-related
   consequences influence user evaluation of IT solutions. (c) 2006

AB There is growing recognition that firms in the contemporary business
   environment derive substantial and sustained competitive advantage from
   a bundle of intangible assets such as knowledge, networks and
   innovative capability. Measuring the return on such intangible assets
   has now become imperative for managers. The present manuscript focuses
   on the measurement of the return on marketing. We first discuss the
   conditions that make this task a high managerial priority. We then
   discuss measurement efforts to date, both in general management and
   marketing. We then offer a conceptual framework that places measurement
   efforts in a historical perspective. We conclude with a discussion on
   where the future of marketing metrics lies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All

TI Unions, work practices, and wages under different institutional
   environments: The case of Canada and England
SO INDUSTRIAL & LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGH-PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRIAL-RELATIONS; BRITAIN; MANAGEMENT
AB Using data collected in 2003-2004 in national telephone surveys of 750
   Canadian and 450 English workers, the author finds that alternative
   work practices (Awl's), such as autonomous teams, quality circles, and
   information sharing, provided meaningful pay gains for non-union
   workers but not union workers in both Canada and England. In Canada,
   non-union AWP payoffs approached union wage premia at even moderate
   levels of AWP adoption, suggesting that AWPs may serve as an
   alternative means to higher pay, one that is incompatible with unions
   and that could erode demand for union representation. In England, there
   was no meaningful union wage premium, suggesting that AWPs may have
   replaced pay bargaining as a means to higher pay; but an interaction
   term combining union representation and "best" HR practices bore a
   strong association with higher pay, consistent with a new economic role
   whereby unions achieve gains for their members through collaborative,
   performance-enhancing strategies.

AB One little-explored question concerning innovative human resources
   practices is how the intensity of their implementation affects their
   impact on establishment performance: is the relationship linear, or
   more complex? This analysis, using U.S. Census Bureau data for 1997
   from a sample of 1,212 private sector manufacturing establishments,
   investigates the possibility of non-linearities in the relationship
   between establishment performance and six human resource practices. The
   author finds departures from linearity that are both statistically
   significant and substantively meaningful for four of the six practices.
   He concludes that linear estimations of these relationships could
   mislead theorists and result in faulty recommendations to practitioners.
