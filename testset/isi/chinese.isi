TI Effects of Sulfation on the Physicochemical and Functional Properties
of Psyllium
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB The sulfation of psyllium was carried out with sulfur trioxide-pyridine
in dimethyl formamide. Three sulfated psyllium derivatives, named SP1,
SP2, and SP3, were characterized by sulfur content determination,
elemental analysis, FT-IR, and surface charge analysis. The sulfated
derivatives were also evaluated for their morphological and
rheological properties, water uptake capacities, swelling volumes, and
in vitro bile acid-binding abilities. The results showed that sulfation
reduced the gelling capacity of psyllium and the viscosity of its
solution, and significantly increased its bile acid-binding capacity.
Sulfation might also increase the water uptake ability of psyllium but
might decrease its swelling capacity. The three sulfated psyllium
derivatives had in vitro binding capacities against cholic and
chenodeoxycholic acids comparable to that of cholestyramine resin on
a per same as it is weight basis. The bile acid-binding capacity of
SP1 was about 8.4-fold of that observed for the original psyllium
preparation under the same assay conditions. The results from this
study suggest that sulfation is a possible approach to obtain novel
psyllium derivatives with desirable physicochemical, functional, and
biological properties for utilization in functional foods or
supplemental and pharmaceutical products.

TI EFFECT OF CROCETIN ON BLOOD PRESSURE RESTORATION AND SYNTHESIS OF
INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS IN HEART AFTER HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK IN
ANESTHETIZED RATS
SO SHOCK
AB Crocetin, a constituent of saffron, has been shown not only to prevent
reactive oxygen species-induced hepatotoxicity and genotoxicity but
also to increase whole-body oxygen consumption and survival. The
present study was to determine whether crocetin has beneficial effects
on cardiac injury caused by hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation in
rats. Anesthetized rats were bled to reduce mean arterial pressure
(MAP) to 35 +/- 5 mmHg for 60 min and then resuscitated with their
withdrawn shed blood and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Crocetin
was administered via the duodenum at 50 mg/kg 40 min after bleeding.
We investigated MAP, serum creatine kinase activity, the activity of
nuclear factor-kappa B, iNOS, and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD),
as well as levels of NO, malondialdehyde, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in the
heart at 2 h postresuscitation. Compared with control group, crocetin
significantly increased MAP from 10 min after administration to the
end of the protocol except the period between 75 and 90 min after initial
bleeding, whereas serum creatine kinase activity was dramatically
decreased at 2 h postresuscitation. Myocardial nuclear factor-kappa
B activity, iNOS activity, NO, malondialdehyde, TNF-alpha, and IL-6
were significantly elevated, whereas T-SOD activity was suppressed in
the control group if compared with those of sham animals. These
parameters tended to be normalized in rats administered crocetin. These
results suggest that crocetin blocks inflammatory cascades by
inhibiting reactive oxygen species production and preserving T-SOD
activity to ameliorate the cardiac injury caused by
hemorrhage/resuscitation.

TI The Targeting Behavior of Folate-Nanohydrogel Evaluated by Near
Infrared Imaging System in Tumor-Bearing Mouse Model
SO PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
AB Purpose. To synthesize
P[(Folate-Allylamine)-co-(N-isopropylacrylamine)-co-Acrylamide] (P
(FoAAnco-NIPA- AAm), folate-NHG) with appropriate diameter and lower
critical solution temperature (LCST) for targeting to folate receptor
(FR) expressing tumors.
Methods. Folate-NHG was synthesized by free-radical precipitation
polymerization method reported in our previous work and other reports.
LCST, diameter and morphology of folate-NHG were characterized by
UV-vis spectrophotometer, laser particle size analyzer (LPSA) and
transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively. No. 12 near
infrared dye (NIRD-12) was entrapped into folate-NHG by hydrophobic
association to trace the in vivo dynamic behavior of folate-NHG. This
process was evaluated by a homemade near infrared (NIR) imaging system.
Results. Spherical folate-NHG with diameter of about 50 nm and LCST
of about 40 C was successfully synthesized. The photo stability of
NIRD-12 was strengthened after being entrapped into folate-NHG, which
enabled NIRD-12 to better trace the in vivo dynamic process of
folate-NHG. Folate-NHG showed good targeting capability for all three
folate receptor expressing tumor models (SMMC-7721, Bel-7402 and HeLa)
with different sizes, and this accumulation could last for more than
96 h. D-folate-NHG, synthesized with double amount of FoAAn, showed
better targeting effect for SMMC-7721 tumor model than that of
folate-NHG.
Conclusions. Folate-NHG could actively accumulate in three models of
folate receptor positive tumors with different sizes and keep retention
for more than 96 h, which enables it to be used as a diagnostic reagent
or anti-tumor drug carrier for tumor therapy.

TI An oxidative analogue of gambogic acid-induced apoptosis of human
hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 is involved in its anticancer
activity in vitro
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION
AB The objective of this study was to investigate the apoptosis-inducing
effect of an oxidative analogue of gambogic acid (GA) on the human
hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and explore the related
molecular mechanisms. HepG2 cells were treated with the analogue of
GA and the growth inhibition was analysed by MTT assay. The
morphological changes in cells were observed under an inverted light
microscope and a fluorescence microscope. In addition, both the
cell-cycle arrest and the apoptosis rate were detected by flow
cytometry. Western blot was used to evaluate the alteration of protein
expression. The viability of HepG2 cells was markedly inhibited in a
concentration-dependent manner and obvious morphological changes were
confirmed, including condensed chromatin and reduced volume. Increased
percentage of apoptotic cells was displayed and altered expression
level of several apoptosis-associated proteins, P53, Bcl-2, Bax and
pro-caspase-3, was obtained. The newly synthesized analogue of GA
exhibited potential anticancer activity, induced remarkable apoptosis
in HepG2 cells, probably through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway,
and promised to be a new candidate for future cancer therapy. European

TI Synergistic effect of 5-fluorouracil and the flavanoid oroxylin A on
HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and on H-22 transplanted mice
SO CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB To investigate the synergistic inhibitory effects of the combination
of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with the natural flavanoid oroxylin A on human
hepatocellular carcinoma cells HepG2 in vitro and on transplanted
murine hepatoma 22 (H-22) tumors in vivo and the preliminary
mechanisms.
The inhibitory effects of 5-FU combined with the natural flavanoid
oroxylin A in vitro were detected by MTT assay and the effects in vivo
were investigated by transplanted H-22 mice model. DAPI staining and
Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining were used to detect
the cell morphological changes and apoptosis. The mRNA levels of
thymidine synthetase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)
in HepG2 cells after oroxylin A and 5-FU combination treatment were
observed by quantitative real-time PCR. Western blotting assay was used
to reveal the expressions of apoptotic-inducing proteins P53, cleaved
PARP, COX-2, Bcl-2, and pro-caspase3.
Oroxylin A in combination with 5-FU presented synergistic effect (CI
< 1) on HepG2 cells in vitro when the inhibitory rate was higher than
7.5%. The inhibitory rate on H-22 murine solid tumor in vivo in the
combination group was higher than monotherapy. 5-FU combined with
oroxylin A exerted stronger apoptotic induction in HepG2 cells than
either single drug treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR discovered
the downregulation of TS mRNA and DPD mRNA in HepG2 cells after
combination treatment. Western blotting assay revealed oroxylin A
enhanced 5-FU-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells by elevating the
expressions of apoptotic-inducing proteins P53 and cleaved PARP and
decreasing the expression of apoptotic-inhibitory proteins COX-2,
Bcl-2, and pro-caspase3.
The anti-hepatocellular carcinoma effects in vitro and in vivo of 5-FU
and oroxylin A combinations were synergistic and oroxylin A increased
the sensitivity of HepG2 cells to 5-FU by modulating the metabolic
enzymes of 5-FU and apoptotic-related proteins.

TI Bioassay-guided separation of the proinflammatory constituents from
the roots of Euphorbia kansui
SO JOURNAL OF NATURAL MEDICINES
AB In view of the toxic inflammatory reaction induced by Euphorbia kansui
roots, a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of edema,
ascites, and asthma, the 95% ethanol extract was found to have a
significant stimulating effect on inflammatory cells. Bioassay-guided
separation of the 95% ethanol extract from the roots of E. kansui led
to the isolation of five diterpenoids whose structures were identified
by H-1, C-13 NMR spectroscopy and HR-ESI-MS as kansuinine B (1),
kansuinine A (2), kansuiphorin C (3), 3-O-benzoyl-20-deoxyingenol (4),
and 3-O-(2'E,4'Z-decadienoyl)-20-O-acetylingenol (5). The
proinflammatory effect of compounds 1-5 was evaluated in vitro in
models of inflammation using exoteric mice splenic lymphocytes (SPL)
and rat peritoneal macrophages (PM phi). Compounds 1, 2, and 5 markedly
promoted SPL proliferation and NO production by PM phi at
concentrations from 0.78 to 12.50 mu g/mL. Hence the three compounds
are believed to be important proinflammatory components of the roots
of E. kansui.

TI Incorporation of liquid lipid in lipid nanoparticles for ocular drug
delivery enhancement
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The present work investigates the effect of liquid lipid incorporation
on the physicochemical properties and ocular drug delivery enhancement
of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and attempts to elucidate in
vitro and in vivo the potential of NLCs for ocular drug delivery. The
CyA-loaded or fluorescein-marked nanocarriers composed of Precifac ATO
5 and Miglyol 840 (as liquid lipid) were prepared by melting-emulsion
technology, and the physicochemical properties of nanocarriers were
determined. The uptake of nanocarriers by human corneal epithelia cell
lines (SDHCEC) and rabbit cornea was examined. Ex vivo fluorescence
imaging was used to investigate the ocular distribution of
nanocarriers. The in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo acute tolerance
were evaluated. The higher drug loading capacity and improved in vitro
sustained drug release behavior of lipid nanoparticles was found with
the incorporation of liquid lipid in lipid nanoparticles. The uptake
of nanocarriers by the SDHCEC was increased with the increase in liquid
lipid loading. The ex vivo fluorescence imaging of the ocular tissues
indicated that the liquid lipid incorporation could improve the ocular
retention and penetration of ocular therapeutics. No alternation was
macroscopically observed in vivo after ocular surface exposure to
nanocarriers. These results indicated that NLC was a biocompatible and
potential nanocarrier for ocular drug delivery enhancement.

TI Effect of oral immunization with Aeromonas hydrophila ghosts on
protection against experimental fish infection
SO LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB Aims:
To investigate whether oral immunization with Aeromonas hydrophila
ghosts (AHG) vaccine can elicit mucosal and systemic immune responses
of Carp (Carassius auratus gibelio) compared to conventional
formalin-killed bacteria (FKC).
Methods and Results:
Fish were fed diets coated with AHG, FKC or phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) alone, after immunization, more antigen-specific antibody was
significantly detected in serum and intestinal mucus in AHG group than
FKC group and PBS group. In addition, after challenged with the parent
strain J-1, the survival of bacterial ghost-vaccinated fish was higher
than PBS group and FKC group, the relative per cent survival (RPS) being
76 center dot 8%, 58 center dot 9%, respectively.
Conclusions:
Oral immunization with A. hydrophila ghosts can elicit systemic and
mucosal adaptive immune responses and has higher potential to induce
protective adaptive immunity than normal vaccine.
Significance and Impact of the Study:
Oral immunization with bacterial ghosts is a promising new solution
with potential application to prevent diseases in fish.

TI Emergence of noncollinear magnetic ordering in bimetallic Co6-nMnn
clusters
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Using spin-polarized density functional calculations, we have studied
the magnetic states including collinear and noncollinear magnetic
coupling in bimetallic Co6-nMnn clusters. The ground state of Co6-nMnn
clusters displays collinear magnetic ordering for n <= 3, whereas a
magnetic transition to noncollinear ordering occurs at n = 4 and the
noncollinear magnetic structure remains to be energetically favoured
afterwards. Moreover, the total magnetic moment of Co6-nMnn increases
with n by 2 mu(B) for n = 0-3 and decreases sharply from n = 3 to n
= 4, while the decreasing trend becomes smooth for n = 4-6. The
competition of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions
between the neighbouring magnetic moments induces the emergence of
noncollinear magnetic coupling in the small bimetallic clusters.

TI Formulation optimization of dihydroartemisinin nanostructured lipid
carrier using response surface methodology
SO POWDER TECHNOLOGY
AB Response surface methodology (RSM) using the central composite
rotatable design (CCRD) model was used to optimize formulations of
dihydroartemisinin nancistructured lipid carrier (DHA-NLC). The CCRD
consisting of three-factored factorial design with three levels was
used in this study The drug encapsulation efficiency (EE), drug loading
(DL) percentage and particle size of DHA-NLC were investigated with
respect to three independent variables including DHA concentration
(XI), lipid concentration (X-2) and ratio of liquid lipid to total lipid
(X-3). The result showed that the optimal formulation could be obtained
from this response surface methodology The optimal formulation for
DHA-NLC was composed of DHA concentration (X-1) of 1 g/l, lipid
concentration (X-2) of 1% and ratio of liquid lipid to total lipid (X-3)
of 0.1:1. DHA-NLC under the optimized conditions gave rise to the EE
of (98.97 +/- 2.3)%, DL of (15.61 +/- 1.9) mean diameter of (198 +/4.7) nm, polydispersity index (PI) of 0.146 and zeta potential value
of (-21.6 +/- 1.3) mV TEM of the optimized NLC showed spherical
particles. The in vitro experiments proved that DHA in the NLC released
gradually over the period of 48 h. This study showed that the RSM-CCRD
could efficiently be applied for the modeling of DHA-NLC. Published

TI Qualitative and quantitative analysis of steroidal saponins in crude
extracts from Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis and P. polyphylla var.
chinensis by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass
spectrometry
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
AB High performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray
ionization multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MSn) and
triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS),
respectively, had been employed for the simultaneous identification
and quantification of steroidal saponins in the rhizomes of Paris
polyphylla var. yunnanensis and A polyphylla var. chinensis, which are
the qualified plants of "Chonglou" in Chinese. The HPLC experiments
were performed by means of a reversed-phase C-18 column and a binary
mobile phase system consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid and
acetonitrile under gradient elution conditions. The characteristic
fragmentation patterns of diosgenin- and pennogenin-type steroidal
saponins were investigated using ESI-MSn in negative ion mode. The MSn
data of the [M-H](-) ions provided structural information on the sugar
sequence of the oligosaccharide chains and the aglycones of steroidal
saponins. As a result, ten and seven saponins were determined in A
polyphylla var. yunnanensis and P. polyphylla var. chinensis,
respectively, including four unknown compounds. One unknown compound
was tentatively identified as
diosgenin-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1 --> 4)
[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1 --> 2)]-beta-D-glucopyranoside and the
aglycones of the other three new compounds were reported from Chonglou
for the first time. The developed HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was validated
and found to be satisfactorily linear, selective and robust. The limits
of detection (LODs) and quantitation (LOQs) ranged, respectively, from
0.5 to 10 ng/mL and 2 to 34 ng/mL depending on six various compounds.
The intra- and inter-day precisions of the method were evaluated and
were less than 5.0%. Recoveries ranged from 92% to 104% for all
compounds. The established quality evaluation method was successfully
used for simultaneous quantification of six predominant steroidal
saponins in the rhizomes of these two Paris species. (C) 2009 Elsevier

TI Resveratrol Restores Lysophosphatidylcholine-induced Loss of
Endothelium-dependent Relaxation in Rat Aorta Tissue Coinciding with
Inhibition of Extracellular-signal-regulated Protein Kinase
Activation
SO PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB To investigate whether resveratrol could restore the
lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced loss of endothelium-dependent
relaxation in in vitro cultured rat aorta tissue, first the effect of
resveratrol on the loss of EDR was examined in this preparation. The
results showed that resveratrol effectively attenuated the inhibition
of LPC (10 mu m) on both endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF)
and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in a
concentration-dependent manner (1, 10, 100 mu m). In addition,
resveratrol inhibited elevated K+-induced vascular contracture, but
had no significant effects on ACh (1 mu m)-induced
endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR). A similar tendency was also
observed with PD 98059 (30 mu m), a selective inhibitor of ERK. When
the cells were exposed to LPC (20 mu M) the mRNA expression of eNOS
and COX-1 mRNA were down-regulated, followed by a local induction of
iNOS and COX-2. Resveratrol and PD 98059 successfully reversed the
effects of LPC on relative mRNA expressions. Both resveratrol and PD
98059 inhibited the activation of ERK induced by LPC. These findings
demonstrate that resveratrol can restore the LPC-induced loss of EDR
in rat aorta and protect the endothelium against LPC-induced injuries
via the inhibition of the inflammation-like response. Copyright (C)

TI Effects of chitosan coating on physical properties and pharmacokinetic
behavior of mitoxantrone liposomes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the physical properties and
in vivo circulation of chitosan (CH)-coated liposomes of mitoxantrone
(MTO). Changes in particle size and zeta potential confirmed the
existence of a coating layer on the surface of liposomes. The in vitro
release of adsorbed CH from the liposomes was significantly slower than
CH solution, indicating the stable interaction between CH and
liposomes. The physical stability of the CH-coated liposomes was
evaluated by measuring the change in particle size before and after
freeze-drying and rehydration. The smallest change was observed when
saturated adsorption of CH occurred (0.3%). The sustained release in
vitro of MTO from CH-coated liposomes confirmed the increased stability
of liposomes. Systemic circulation of CH-coated MTO liposomes was
examined. The 0.3% CH-coated liposomes showed the longest circulation
time. It could be concluded that the prolonged retention time of the
liposomes was closely related with CH coating and its stability effect.

AB Near infrared spectroscopy possess great potential for in vivo
quantitative monitoring of drugs in animal subject. The accuracy of
the measurements by near infrared technique should be evaluated by an
established method. In this study, a near infrared fluorescence dye,
cypate and its conjugation cypate-PEG were used as model drug for in
vivo dynamic study. The pharmacokinetics of the model drug in mice
subjects were investigated by near infrared spectroscopy and high
performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The results from the
two techniques were compared. The pharmacokinetic parameters
calculated based on the acquired data by DAS software showed that there
were no statistical differences between the two methods. The dynamic
distribution of the model drugs in mouse model imaged by NIR image
system indicated that cypate firstly accumulated in liver and was
cleared from the enteron system, while cypate - PEG clearance from the
urine system. Results indicated that NIR monitoring technique provide
a promising quantitative way for in vivo monitoring the dynamics of
drugs in animal subjects.

AB In this paper, we present a new facile and environmental friendly method
to prepare water-soluble near-infrared (NIR)-emitting PbS quantum dots
(QDs) at room temperature under ambient conditions, using
dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) as a stabilizer. The photoluminescence (PL)
emissions of the prepared DHLA-capped PbS QDs are tunable between 870
and 1010 nm. A PL quantum yield (QY) of similar to 10% can be achieved
under optimized conditions without any post-preparative treatment.
Here, we further use the produced DHLA-capped PbS QDs for NIR
fluorescence imaging in a mouse model. The obtained experimental
results showed that the NIR fluorescence of the PbS QDs in living
tissues generated from the excitation with semiconductor laser
(lambda(max)=765.9 nm) could penetrate living tissues and be detected
easily by the noninvasive in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging system. In
addition, the preliminary studies on the cytotoxicity and in vivo
toxicity of the QDs also indicates fully that these water-soluble
DHLA-capped PbS QDs are very lowly toxic, and as such they should have
greater potential in biological and medical applications especially
in noninvasive in vivo fluorescence imaging of mice, compared to other
existing highly toxic aqueous NIR-emitting quantum dots (CdTe, HgTe,
etc).

TI Structural Relationship and Binding Mechanisms of Five Flavonoids with
Bovine Serum Albumin
SO MOLECULES
AB Flavonoids are structurally diverse and the most ubiquitous groups of
dietary polyphenols distributed in various fruits and vegetables. In
this study, the interaction between five flavonoids, namely
formononetin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside, calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside,
calycosin, rutin, and quercetin, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was
investigated by fluorescence and UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy. In
the discussion, it was proved that the fluorescence quenching of BSA
by flavonoids was a result of the formation of a flavonoid-BSA complex.
Fluorescence quenching constants were determined using the
Stern-Volmer and Lineweaver-Burk equations to provide a measure of the
binding affinity between the flavonoids and BSA. The binding constants
ranked in the order quercetin > rutin > calycosin >
calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside approximate to
formononetin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside. The results of thermodynamic
parameters Delta G, Delta H, and Delta S at different temperatures
indicated that the hydrophobic interaction played a major role in
flavonoid-BSA association. The distance r between BSA and acceptor
flavonoids was also obtained according to Forster's theory of
non-radiative energy transfer.

TI Different Apoptotic Effects of Wogonin Via Induction of H2O2 Generation
and Ca2+ Overload in Malignant Hepatoma and Normal Hepatic Cells
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Wogonin, a major active constituent of Scutellaria baicalensis,
possesses potent anticancer activities both in vivo and in vitro. This
paper describes the different apoptotic effects of wogonin in HepG2
and L02 cells and the possible mechanism for the differences. Through
DAPI staining, Annexin-V/PI double-staining assay, JC-1 detection and
the expressions of the key apoptotic proteins, we find that wogonin
prefers to induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells through the mitochondrial
pathway, while has much less effects on L02 cells. Moreover,
overexpression of Bcl-2 can block wogonin-induced apoptosis in HepG2
cells. To illustrate the specific selective mechanism of wogonin in
apoptosis induction, H2O2, O-center dot(2)- and Ca2+ are measured by
2',7'-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate, dihydroethidium and Flou-3 AM
assay, respectively. The results show that the different apoptotic
effects of wogonin in HepG2 and L02 cells are due to the different
regulations to the redox balance of reactive oxygen species and the
Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum. IP3R-sensitive Ca2+ channels
are the key targets of the wogonin-increased H2O2. Besides, the
activation of PLC gamma 1 plays as a bridge between H2O2 signal
molecules and Ca2+ release. Taken together, wogonin preferentially
kills hepatoma cells by H2O2-dependent apoptosis triggered by Ca2+
overload. The results reveal that wogonin is a competitive anticancer
drug candidate for the malignant hepatoma therapy. J. Cell. Biochem.

TI Chemical Constituents and Effective Substances of Traditional Chinese
Medicinal Formula
SO PROGRESS IN CHEMISTRY
AB Traditional Chinese medicinal formula (TCMF) is an important clinic
guide for application of Chinese medicines. It is a reflection of both
diagnosis and treatment of traditional Chinese medical theory,
occupying a pivotal position in the system of Chinese medicine. At
present, TCMF is facing difficulties because its curative effects are
largely based on the prescribing doctor's experience and its effective
constituents and mechanisms of action are unclear, which seriously
restricts their development in the international market. Chemical
constituents and effective substance basis of TCMF are two important
parts of the study of Chinese medicines. In the recent years, the
development of modern biological and analytical techniques have
provided new techniques and approaches for the modern studies on
chemical constituents and effective substances in TCMF. In this paper,
we reviewed the latest progress of studying the chemical constituents
and effective substance basis of TCMF, and put forward basic thoughts
on improving research activities in the area.

TI Activation of AMP-activated Protein Kinase by Temozolomide Contributes
to Apoptosis in Glioblastoma Cells via p53 Activation and mTORC1
Inhibition
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Methylating drugs such as temozolomide (TMZ) are widely used in the
treatment of brain tumors including malignant glioblastoma. The
mechanism of TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell death and apoptosis,
however, is not fully understood. Here, we tested the potential
involvement of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in this process.
We found that methylating agents TMZ and
N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine induce AMPK activation in
primary cultured human glioblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines.
TMZ-induced O-6-methylguanine production is involved in AMPK
activation. O-6-benzylguanine, an O-6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor, enhances TMZ-induced O-6-methylguanine
production, leading to enhanced reactive oxygen species production,
which serves as an upstream signal for AMPK activation. Activation of
AMPK is involved in TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell death and apoptosis.
AMPK inhibitor (Compound C) or AMPK alpha siRNA knockdown inhibits
TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell death and apoptosis, whereas AMPK
activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside
enhances it. In further studies, we found that activation of AMPK is
involved in TMZ-induced p53 activation and subsequent p21, Noxa, and
Bax up-regulation. Activation of AMPK by TMZ also inhibits mTOR complex
1 (mTORC1) signaling and promotes anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2
down-regulation, which together mediate TMZ-induced pro-cell
apoptosis effects. Our study suggests that activation of AMPK by TMZ
contributes to glioblastoma cell apoptosis, probably by promoting p53
activation and inhibiting mTORC1 signaling.

flower heads of Chrysanthemum indicum L. from eight populations in
China were analyzed by GC/MS. A total of 169 compounds representing
88.79-99.53% of the oils were identified, and some remarkable
differences were found in the constituent percentages of the eight
populations. The predominant components of the essential oils were
1,8-cineole (0.62-7.34%), (+)-(1R,4R)-camphor (0.17-27.56%),
caryophyllene oxide (0.54-5.8%), beta-phellandrene (0.72-1.87%),
(-)-(1S,2R,4S)-borneol acetate (0.33-8.46%),
2-methyl-6-(p-tolyl)hept-2-ene (0.3-8.6%),
4,6,6-trimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-3-en-2-yl acetate (0.17-26.48%),
and hexadecanoic acid (0.72-15.97%). The chemotaxonomic value of the
essential-oil compositions was discussed according to the results of
cluster analysis (CA) and principal-component analysis (PCA). The
eight populations were divided into five groups as different chemotypes
(Groups A-E), and the scores together with the loadings revealed
clearly different chemical properties of each population. In
conclusion, GC/MS in combination with chemometric techniques provided
a flexible and reliable method for characterizing the essential oils
of different populations of C. indicum L.

prepared using oligonucelotide as coupling molecules. The resulted
bio-AgNPs could be used for visual detection for protein arrays by a
catalytical reaction with hydroquinone/AgNO3. To probe the feasibility
of visual detection, human IgG was used as a model protein sample to
be immobilized on the glass slides and bio-AgNPs were employed to couple
with the protein via stripavaidin labeled anti-human IgG. The results
show that the linear relationship of protein concentration is between
160 fg and 100 pg and the limit of detection is 160 fg(S/N = 3). Compared
with the method using SA-labeled gold nanoparticle or silver

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB In order to develop more potent, selective and less toxic steroidal
aromatase (AR) inhibitors, molecular docking, 2D and 3D hybrid
quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) study have been
conducted using topological, molecular shape, spatial, structural and
thermodynamic descriptors on 32 steroidal compounds. The molecular
docking study shows that one or more hydrogen bonds with MET374 are
one of the essential requirements for the optimum binding of ligands.
The QSAR model obtained indicates that the aromatase inhibitory
activity can be enhanced by increasing SIC, SC_3_C, Jurs_WNSA_1,
Jurs_WPSA_1 and decreasing CDOCKER interaction energy (E-CD),
IAC_Total and Shadow_XZfrac. The predicted results shows that this

TI Comparative study on the anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive
effect of Wilforlide A
SO FITOTERAPIA
AB Tripterygium Glycosides (TG) is effective in the treatment of patients
with a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, especially
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in clinical. Wilforlide A (T-1) serves as
a quality control standard of TG that be listed in Drug Standard of
Ministry of Public Health of the People's Republic of China. The
pharmacologic actions of T-1 remain to be unidentified. In this paper,
we studied the anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive effect of T-1,
and compared it with Triptolide (TP), which believed to be the major
active component of TG. Carrageenan-induced rat pedal swelling,
tampon-induced rat granulation, and mice ear inhibition rate of
swelling trail results show that high-dose T-1 has obvious
anti-inflammatory effect. Colorimetric detection contents of
hemolysin, carbon elimination from plasma of mice, mice delayed
hypersensitivity immune, and organ index were measured. The results
show that T-1 has no significant immune suppressive activity, and there
has a significant difference with TP and TG. Therefore, we think the
content of TP also should be controlled as a supplement standard in
order to ensure safe and effective medication. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

I by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
ARZNEIMITTEL-FORSCHUNG-DRUG RESEARCH
A A rapid and sensitive method based on liquid chromatography/tandem mass
B spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed and fully validated for the
quantitative determination of sodium tanshinone HA sulfonate (STS,
sodium
(1,6,6-trimethyl-10,11-dioxo-7,8,9-trihydrophenanthro[1,2-b]furan)
-yl-2- sulfonate) in rat biosamples including plasma and different
tissues using sodium tanshinone I sulfonate (sodium
(1,6-dimethyl-10,11-dioxo-phenanthro[1,2-b]furan)-yl-2-sulfonate)
as internal standard. Simple protein precipitation by acetonitrile was
utilized for extracting STS from the rat biosamples. Chromatographic
separation of the sample matrix from the analyte and the internal
standard was performed using a commercially available analytical
column with a mobile phase consisting of methanol-5 mmoL/L ammonia
acetate (70:30, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Detection was
performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer equipped with
an electrospray ionization source and operated in the negative-ion
mode. The intra- and inter-day precisions (RSD%) and deviations of the
assay accuracies were within 10.0% for STS. The extraction recovery
of STS was more than 86.5%. The limit of detection (LOD) of STS was
1.0 ng/mL. The method was successfully applied to the tissue
distribution study of STS intravenously administered to healthy
Sprague-Dawley rats. The tissue distribution results showed that
liver, kidney, lung, small intestine and duodenum were the major
distribution tissues of STS in rats, and that STS had difficulty in
crossing the blood-brain barrier. After 24 h, STS could be detected
only in the kidney, stomach and small intestine, indicating that there
was no long-term accumulation of STS in rat.

TI Effect of structural variations on sorption and desorption of
phenanthrene by sediment organic matter
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Sorption and desorption isotherms of phenanthrene (PHE) on sediment
organic matter (SOM) prepared at different combustion temperature were
studied to examine the impact of SOM structure on sorption and
desorption. With the increase of combustion temperature from 0 to 400
degrees C, the aromatic groups (-C=C) in SOM samples increased, while
the aliphatic groups (-CH, -CH2) and polar structures (-C-O, -OH)
decreased. When the combustion temperature increased to 500 degrees
C. aliphatic structures, polar structures and most aromatic structures
were burnt out, and the mineral materials were dominant in the sample.
The increase of combustion temperature decrease the sorption isotherm
nonlinearity index n value, and enhanced the adsorption capacity and
desorption hysteresis for PHE on SOM. However, higher n value, lower
sorption capacity and sorption irreversibility were presented in the
sample treated at 500 degrees C (T500). Positive correlations between
single-point organic carbon-normalized distribution coefficient log
K-oc values and aromatic carbon (p < 0.01) and negative correlations
between log K-oc values and aliphaticity or H/C ratios (p < 0.05) were
observed. There was a negative relation between hysteresis index (HI)
value and aromatic carbon (p < 0.01) and a negative trend of the sorption
isotherm nonlinearity index n values and aromatic carbon (p < 0.01).
The above results indicated the dominance of aromatic structures in
the sorption nonlinearity, sorption capacity and desorption hysteresis
of PHE on SOM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Antidiabetic and antioxidant effects of extracts from Potentilla
discolor Bunge on diabetic rats induced by high fat diet and
streptozotocin
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Aim of the study: Potentilla discolor Bunge, commonly found at the north
temperate and boreal zone, has been used for diabetes in China for a
long time. Flavonoids and triterpenoids are two major types of
compounds in P. discolor. This study was designed primarily to
investigate the effects of total flavonoids extract (TFE) and total
triterpenoids extract (TTE) of P. discolor Bunge on blood glucose,
lipid profiles and antioxidant parameters on diabetic rats induced by
high fat diet and streptozotocin.
Materials and methods: High fat diet-fed and streptozotocin-induced
diabetic rats were treated with the TFE and TTE for 15 days,
respectively. A range of parameters were tested including fasting blood
glucose (FBG), serum insulin (SI), blood lipid profile,
malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH),
glycosylated serum protein (GSP), and nitric oxide (NO).
Results: Diabetic rats treated with TFE or TTE had decreased
concentration of FBG and GSP compared with the control group.
Meanwhile, the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides
(TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in the TFE or TTE
treated diabetic rats were lower, and the high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-c) level was higher than in the control diabetic rats.
Furthermore, the extracts treatment decreased the MDA and NO level,
while increased SOD and GSH levels in diabetic rats. Histopathologic
examination also showed that the extracts have protective effects on
beta-cells in diabetic rats which are supported by the increase of SI.
Conclusions: All these experimental results highlighted the
hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties of the two extracts from
Potentilla discolor Bunge on diabetes and its complications, possibly
through a strong antioxidant activity and a protective action on
beta-cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA free acid) in rat plasma, urine and feces
by liquid chromatography with UV and tandem mass spectrometric
detection
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB BAPTA free acid was identified as the main metabolic product of
1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid
tetra(actoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM), a neuroprotective agent in
cerebral ischemia, in rats. In this paper, liquid
chromatography-ultraviolet (LC-UV) and mass spectrometry/mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were employed for the determination
of BAPTA free acid in rat urine and feces and rat plasma, respectively.
By liquid-liquid extraction and LC-UV analysis, a limit of quantitation
of 1000 ng/ml using 0.2 ml rat urine for extraction and 250 ng/ml using
1 ml rat fecal homogenate supernatant for extraction could be reached.
The assay was linear in the range of 1000-50,000 ng/ml for rat urine
and 250-10,000 ng/ml for rat fecal homogenate supernatant. Because the
sensitivity of the LC-UV method was apparently insufficient for
evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile of BAPTA in rat plasma, a
LC-MS/MS method was subsequently developed for the analysis of BAPTA
free acid. By protein precipitation and LC-MS/MS analysis, the limit
of quantitation was 5 ng/ml using 0.1 ml rat plasma and the linear range
was 5.0-500 ng/ml. Both methods were validated and can be used to
support a thorough preclinical pharmacokinetic evaluation of BAPTA-AM
liposome injection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Flavokawain B, the hepatotoxic constituent from kava root, induces
GSH-sensitive oxidative stress through modulation of IKK/NF-kappa B
and MAPK signaling pathways
SO FASEB JOURNAL
AB Kava (Piper methysticum Foster, Piperaceae) organic solvent-extract
has been used to treat mild to moderate anxiety, insomnia, and muscle
fatigue in Western countries, leading to its emergence as one of the
10 best-selling herbal preparations. However, several reports of
severe hepatotoxicity in kava consumers led the U. S. Food and Drug
Administration and authorities in Europe to restrict sales of
kava-containing products. Herein we demonstrate that flavokawain B
(FKB), a chalcone from kava root, is a potent hepatocellular toxin,
inducing cell death in HepG2 (LD50 = 15.3 +/- 0.2 mu M) and L-02 (LD50
= 32 mu M) cells. Hepatocellular toxicity of FKB is mediated by
induction of oxidative stress, depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH),
inhibition of IKK activity leading to NF-kappa B transcriptional
blockade, and constitutive TNF-alpha-independent activation of
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, namely,
ERK, p38, and JNK. We further demonstrate by noninvasive
bioluminescence imaging that oral consumption of FKB leads to
inhibition of hepatic NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in vivo and
severe liver damage. Surprisingly, replenishment with exogenous GSH
normalizes both TNF-alpha-dependent NF-kappa B as well as MAPK
signaling and rescues hepatocytes from FKB-induced death. Our data
identify FKB as a potent GSH-sensitive hepatotoxin, levels of which
should be specifically monitored and controlled in kava-containing
herb products.-Zhou, P., Gross, S., Liu, J.-H., Yu, B.-Y., Feng, L.-L.,

Voltammetry
SO ELECTROANALYSIS
AB This work described a novel type of bismuth/poly(bromocresol purple)
film modified glassy carbon electrode (denoted as Bi/Poly(BCP)/GCE)
for anodic stripping analysis of trace Cd2+. The Bi/Poly(BCP)/GCE was
fabricated in situ by depositing simultaneously bismuth and cadmium
by reduction at -1.20 V on the poly(BCP) film using a differential pulse
voltammetry. Under the optimum conditions, the anodic stripping peak
current response increased linearly with the Cd2+ concentrations in
a range of 2.0 x 10(-8)-1.0 x1.0(-7) M and 1.0 x 10(-7)-6.0x10(-6) M
in 0.1 M NaAc-Ac buffer solution (pH 5.0) with the detection limit of
6.5 x 10(-9) M (S/N =3). The Bi/poly(BCP)/GCE performed good
reproducibility and high sensitivity. Finally, this proposed method
was successfully applied to determine the concentration of Cd2+ in
water samples.

TI Radix Astragali (Astragalus): Latest Advancements and Trends in
Chemistry, Analysis, Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics
SO CURRENT ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Radix Astragali (Astragalus) has been used in Traditional Chinese
Medicine for over 2000 years, and still widely used in Asian countries
to enhance the immune system and to protect the body against various
stresses. In Europe and the United States, Astragalus is commonly used
as nutritional dietary supplements and additives to foods and
beverages. During the last several years, we have witnessed a steady
expansion in the number of publications made associated with this herb.
This review focuses on latest advancements and trends in chemistry,
analysis, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of Radix Astragali.
Several types of constituents including triterpene saponins,
flavonoids and astragalus polysaccharides have been summarized, and
astragalus polysaccharides are still a challenging issue. With the
rapid development of analytical techniques, a great number of methods
have been developed for the identification and quantification of the
plant material, extracts, and products of Radix Astragali. Separation
was achieved using thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), callipary electrophoresis (CE), and
high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC). Among these
techniques HPLC and hyphenated methods like HPLC with ultraviolet (UV),
evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD), or mass spectrometry
(MS) are by far the most employed. Radix Astragali has attracted
ever-increasing attention in a variety of biological activity studies;
its immunomodulatory effects, cardioprotective effects,
antihyperglycemic effects, hepatoprotective effects and anticancer
effects were strengthened in this review. Pharmacokinetic studies
showed that the flavonoids could be absorbed and metabolized in vivo,
and their major metabolic pathways are glucuronidation and sulfation,
while the bioavailability of saponins is extremely low.

on Recombinant Human-Insulin Absorption from Intratracheally
Administered Dry Powders in Diabetic Rats
SO CHEMICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the enhancement effect
of the natural pulmonary surfactant (PS) or its artificial substitute,
phospholipid hexadecanol tyloxapol (PHT) on the bioavailability and
hypoglycemic activity of recombinant human insulin (rh-insulin) in a
pulmonary delivery system. PS- or PHT-loaded insulin formulation was
administered to streptozotocin induced diabetic rats, at doses of 5
U/kg, 10 U/kg and 20 U/kg insulin, respectively. The hypoglycemic
effect caused by PS or PHT containing rh-insulin was analyzed and the
area above the curves (AAC) of scrum glucose levels versus time, the
minimum glucose concentration (C-min), the time to C-min (T-min) and
the pharmacological availability (PA%) were derived from the serum
glucose profiles. Results showed that PS and PHT caused significantly
decrease in serum glucose levels. The decrease in plasma glucose levels
continued for about 5 h after the nadir. The highest AAC value was
obtained when 20 U/kg rh-Insulin with PS or PHT as absorption enhancer
was administered to rats. AAC(0-360min) of PS- or PHT-loaded rh-insulin
was 2-3 times as much as that without PS or PHT and PA% increased by
1.3-2 fold. Thus, the extent of oral absorption of insulin from PSor PHT-loaded particles was significantly greater when compared with
that without them. In addition, PHT as well as PS did not change the
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, alkaline phosphatase (AKP)
activity and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucoaminidase (NAG) activity in bronch
fluid which are sensitive indicators of acute toxicity to lung cells
in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). It is concluded that PS and PHT is
a promising absorption enhancer for pulmonary delivery systems of large
molecule drugs as rh-Insulin.

TI Synthesis and biological evaluation of 3-[4-(amino/methylsulfonyl)
phenyl]methylene-indolin-2-one derivatives as novel COX-1/2 and 5-LOX
inhibitors
SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Fourteen new 3-[4-(amino/methylsulfonyl)
phenyl]methylene-indolin-2-one derivatives were synthesized. Six
compounds displayed potent inhibitory activities against COX-1/2 and
5-LOX with IC50 in the range of 0.10-9.87 mu M. Particularly, 10f
exhibited well balanced inhibitory action on these enzymes (IC50 =
0.10-0.56 mu M). More importantly, 10f and several other compounds had
comparable or stronger anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, but
better gastric tolerability in vivo, as compared with darbufelone
mesilate and tenidap sodium. Therefore, our findings may aid in the
design of new and safe anti-inflammatory reagents for the intervention
of painful inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis at
clinic. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Structural characterization and identification of oleanane-type
triterpene saponins in Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fischer by
rapid-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight
mass spectrometry
SO RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Oleanane-type triterpene saponins (OTS) are major active ingredients
in Glycyrrhiza uralensis. In this work, a rapid-resolution liquid
chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC/TOF-MS)
method has been developed to characterize and identify OTS from G.
uralensis. The major diagnostic ions and fragmentation pathways from
thirteen OTS have been characterized for the first time. At a low
fragmentor voltage of 120 V in positive ion mode, the precursor ion
[M + H](+) or/and [M + Na](+) was obtained for accurate determination
of molecular formula. When the fragmentor voltage was increased to 425
V, abundant characteristic fragment ions were observed for structural
characterization. Neutral losses of sugar moieties, such as glucuronic
acid (G1cA, 176 Da), glucose (G1c, 162 Da) and rhamnose (Rha, 146 Da),
were commonly observed in the MS spectra for prediction of the sugar
number and sequences. Other typical losses included AcOH (60 Da), CH2O
(30 Da), 2 x H2O (2 x 18 Da) and HCOOH (46 Da) from [Aglycone + H H2O](+)
(named [B](+)), corresponding to the presence of a C-22-acetyl group,
C-24-hydroxyl group, C-22-hydroxyl group or C-30-carboxyl group on the
aglycone moiety, respectively. In particular, characteristic ring
cleavages of the aglycone moieties on A- and B-rings were observed.
Based on the fragmentation patterns of reference compounds, nineteen
OTS have been identified in an extract of G. uralensis, thirteen of
which were unambiguously identified and the other six were tentatively
assigned. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Metallothioneins Are Required for Formation of Cross-Adaptation
Response to Neurobehavioral Toxicity from Lead and Mercury Exposure
in Nematodes
SO PLOS ONE
AB Metallothioneins (MTs) are small, cysteine-rich polypeptides, but the
role of MTs in inducing the formation of adaptive response is still
largely unknown. We investigated the roles of metallothionein genes
(mtl-1 and mtl-2) in the formation of cross-adaptation response to
neurobehavioral toxicity from metal exposure in Caenorhabditis
elegans. Pre-treatment with mild heat-shock at L2-larva stage
effectively prevented the formation of the neurobehavioral defects and
the activation of severe stress response in metal exposed nematodes
at concentrations of 50 and 100 mM, but pre-treatment with mild
heat-shock did not prevent the formation of neurobehavioral defects
in 200 mM of metal exposed nematodes. During the formation of
cross-adaptation response, the induction of mtl-1 and mtl-2 promoter
activity and subsequent GFP gene expression were sharply increased in
50 mu M or 100 mM of metal exposed Pmtl-1::GFP and Pmtl-2::GFP
transgenic adult animals after mild heat-shock treatment compared with
those treated with mild heat-shock or metal exposure alone. Moreover,
after pre-treatment with mild heat-shock, no noticeable increase of
locomotion behaviors could be observed in metal exposed mtl-1 or mtl-2
mutant nematodes compared to those without mild heat-shock
pre-treatment. The defects of adaptive response to neurobehavioral
toxicity induced by metal exposure formed in mtl-1 and mtl-2 mutants
could be completely rescued by the expression of mtl-1 and mtl-2 with
the aid of their native promoters. Furthermore, overexpression of MTL-1
and MTL-2 at the L2-larval stage significantly suppressed the toxicity
on locomotion behaviors from metal exposure at all examined
concentrations. Therefore, the normal formation of cross-adaptation
response to neurobehavioral toxicity induced by metal exposure may need
the enough accumulation of MTs protein in animal tissues.

TI Folate-Polyethylene Glycol Conjugated Near-Infrared Fluorescence
Probe with High Targeting Affinity and Sensitivity for In Vivo Early
Tumor Diagnosis
SO MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
AB The purpose of this study is to synthesize a folate-polyethylene glycol
(PEG) conjugated near-infrared fluorescence probe (fPI-01) for
diagnosis of folate receptor (FR)-overexpressed tumors with high
sensitivity and specificity.
fPI-01 was synthesized, purified, and characterized. Its cytotoxicity
and affinity to tumor cells were determined in vitro. The dynamics and
biodistribution of the probe was monitored in normal nude mice. And
the tumor-targeting capability was investigated in nude mice bearing
different tumor xenograft.
fPI-01 was successfully synthesized with strengthened optical
properties. Cells experiments showed the probe had high FR affinity
and without apparent cytotoxicity. Animal experiments indicated the
probe excreted through urine by kidney. And its tumor-targeting ability
was demonstrated on different tumor-bearing mice, with high
sensitivity and tumor-to-normal tissue contrast ratio (10:1).
fPI-01 is a promising optical agent for diagnosis of FR-positive
tumors, especially in their early stage.

TI 20(S)-Ginsenoside Rh2 Noncompetitively Inhibits P-Glycoprotein In
Vitro and In Vivo: A Case for Herb-Drug Interactions
SO DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION
AB P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-dependent efflux transporter highly
expressed in gastrointestinal tract and multidrug resistance tumor
cells. Inhibition or induction of P-gp can cause drug-drug interactions
and thus influence the effects of P-gp substrate drugs. Previous
studies indicated that 20(S)-ginsenoside Rh2 [20(S)-Rh2] could
synergistically enhance the anticancer effects of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents at a nontoxic dose. The aim of present study
was to investigate in vitro and in vivo whether 20(S)Rh2 was a P-gp
inhibitor and analyze the possible inhibitory mechanisms and potential
herb-drug interactions. Results showed that in vitro, 20(S)-Rh2
significantly enhanced rhodamine 123 retention in cells and decreased
the efflux ratio of digoxin, fexofenadine, and etoposide, which were
comparable to the effects of the established P-gp inhibitor verapamil.
However, the transport of 20(S)Rh2 suggested that 20(S)-Rh2 was not
a P-gp substrate. Further-more, the inhibitory effect persisted for
at least 3 h after removal of 20(S)-Rh2. Unlike P-gp substrates,
20(S)-Rh2 inhibited both basal and verapamil-stimulated P-gp ATPase
activities. It also significantly decreased UIC2 binding fluorescence,
a marker for conformational change of P-gp. In situ and in vivo
experiments showed that 20(S)-Rh2 increased the area under the plasma
concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration of digoxin,
fexofenadine, and etoposide significantly without affecting terminal
elimination half-time. Long-term treatment with 20(S)-Rh2 failed to
affect intestinal P-gp expression in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion,
20(S)-Rh2 is a potent noncompetitive P-gp inhibitor, which indicates
a potential herb-drug interaction when 20(S)-Rh2 is coadministered
with P-gp substrate drugs. It could increase the absorption of P-gp
substrate drugs without long-term induction of P-gp expression in rats.

TI Recent Advances in Quality Control of Traditional Chinese Medicines
SO COMBINATORIAL CHEMISTRY & HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING
AB Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have been used for disease
prevention and therapy in China for a long history and are becoming
increasingly popular over the world. However, TCMs are complex mixtures
and contain usually hundreds of chemically different constituents,
which make the quality control of crude drugs and their medical
preparations extremely difficult. Therefore, better analytical
strategies to assure their efficacy, safety and consistency are in
great demand. The present work provides an overview of the development
of quality control for TCMs based on microscopic and molecular
identification, quantitative and qualitative analysis, fingerprint,
combination of fingerprint and multi-component quantification, as well
as activity-integrated fingerprint over the last five years. The
biological fingerprinting analysis of TCMs with targeting absorption,
distribution, metabolism, excretion by chromatographic and
chemometric method are also highlighted due to its broad application
in the quality control of TCMs. The comprehensive methods analyzed with
modern hyphenated techniques are strongly recommended to assess the
authenticity, quality consistency and stability of TCMs.

TI Synthesis and Blocking Activities of a New Class of
alpha(1)-Adrenoceptor Antagonists
SO CHEMICAL BIOLOGY & DRUG DESIGN
AB Finding effective chemotherapeutic agents for clinical use is a
long-lasting goal in medicinal chemistry. In this study, we report a
new class of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (alpha(1)-AR) antagonists.
Specifically, we describe the synthesis and the blocking activities
toward alpha(1)-AR of
7-(2-hydroxypropoxy)-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one 1 and its
structurally perturbed analogs 2-11 that were designed according to
the principle of bioisosterism. Their structures were identified with
IR, 1H NMR, MS, HRMS and elemental analysis. The blocking activities
of compounds 1-11 were evaluated on isolated rat anococcygeus muscles.
The results indicated that these compounds showed moderate to good
activities. Among them, compound 1 exhibited the highest activity that
was comparable to those of known alpha(1)-AR antagonists tamsulosin
and DDPH (1-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamino)propane hydrochloride) and thus may be
exploitable as a lead compound for the discovery of promising
alpha(1)-AR antagonists.

TI Amphoteric hyaluronic acid derivative for targeting gene delivery
SO BIOMATERIALS
AB The study aimed to develop an amphoteric hyaluronic acid (HA)
derivative with polyethyleneimine (PEI) chains (HAP) for gene delivery
to overcome the disadvantages of PEI as gene carrier including the
cytotoxicity caused by excess of positive charge, non-special
interaction and aggregation in the blood, and non-target gene delivery.
The HAP was synthesized by an imine reaction between periodate-oxidized
HA and PEI. The HAP/DNA complex was prepared, and its characterization
was investigated. The size of complex with higher molecular weight HA
in PBS was about 200 nm at optimal charge ratio. No apparent aggregation
among the particles was observed. The HAPs also showed high protection
of DNA from nuclease, better dissociation of DNA from the complex and
lower cytotoxicity. It also exhibited higher transfection efficiency
in HepG2 cells than the PEI/DNA complex. Among all complexes, the
HAP50/DNA complex was especially found to be most efficient, yielding
comparable transfection efficiency with that of Lipofectamine/DNA
lipoplexes. Moreover, the HAP-IR820 obviously accumulated in tumor
after i.v. administration as compared to the PEI-IR820, which indicated
that the HAP could assist the DNA targeting to the tumor. Therefore,
HAP should be a promising non-viral gene vector. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Immunization with P277 induces vascular leak syndrome in C57BL/6 mice
via endothelial damage
SO AUTOIMMUNITY
AB Accumulating evidence established a positive association of anti-heat
shock protein 60 (HSP60) autoantibodies and the presence of
atherosclerosis. However, whether anti-P277 (HSP60 437-460)
autoantibodies may lead to the pathological increase in vascular
permeability, a vascular leak syndrome (VLS), is unknown. In the
present study, anti-P277 immunity was effectively induced in C57BL/6
mice, causing a marked increase in VLS in both normal mice and those
bearing melanoma as well. Further analysis of the pathological role
of anti-P277 immunity revealed that the B-cell epitopes located in P277
played a causal role in the development of VLS. Moreover, studies on
endothelial cells (ECs) showed that the anti-P277 antibodies could
cross-react with HSP60, highly expressed in both normal and stressed
ECs, and mediate damage to cells in the presence of complement. These
data suggested that humoral immune response induced by anti-P277
immunity mediates EC damage and induces VLS. These negative effects
may cast shadows on P277, used as a peptide vaccine.

3. Cryptotanshinone was shown to activate CYP3A-mediated midazolam
1-hydroxylation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast,
tanshinone IIA and tanshinone I did not activate this hydroxylation
reaction. In addition, tanshinone IIA activated CYP3A-mediated
testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation, whereas cryptotanshinone and
tanshinone I did not.
4. The results from our study enhance the understanding of CYP3A

SO PHARMACOGNOSY MAGAZINE
AB Background: Sophora flavescens Aiton is an important medicinal plant
in China. Early in vitro researches of S. flavescens were focused on
callus induction and cell suspension culture, only a few were concerned
with in vitro multiplication. Objective: To establish and optimize the
rapid propagation technology of S. flavescens and to generate and
characterize polyploid plants of S. flavescens. Materials and Methods:
The different concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP),
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and kinetin (KT) were used to establish and
screen the optimal rapid propagation technology of S. flavescens by
orthogonal test; 0.2% colchicine solution was used to induce polyploid
plants and the induced buds were identified by root-tip chromosome
determination and stomatal apparatus observation. Results: A large
number of buds could be induced directly from epicotyl and hypocotyl
explants on the Murashige and Skoog medium (MS; 1962) supplemented with
1.4-1.6 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 0.3 mg/l indole-3-acetic
acid (IAA). More than 50 lines of autotetraploid plants were obtained.
The chromosome number of the autotetraploid plantlet was 2n = 4x = 36.
All tetraploid plants showed typical polyploid characteristics.
Conclusion: Obtained autotetraploid lines will be of important genetic
and breeding value and can be used for further selection and plant
breeding.

AB Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole
time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) was
performed to study the fragmentation behaviors of steroidal alkaloids
from Fritillaria species the antitussive and expectorant herbs widely
used in traditional Chinese medicine We propose herein a strategy that
combining key diagnostic fragment ions and the relative abundances and
amounts of major fragment ions (the ions exceeding 10% in abundance)
to distinguish different sub-classes of Fritillaria alkaloids (FAs)
It was found that hydrogen rearrangement and induction effects result
in ring cleavage of the basic skeletons occurred in the MS/MS process
and produced characteristic fragment ions which are useful for
structural elucidation This method was finally used to investigate the
primary steroidal alkaloids in the extracts of eight major Fritillaria
species As a result 41 steroidal alkaloids (29 cevanine type 1 jervine
type 6 veratramine type and 5 secosolanidine type alkaloids) were

TI In vivo metabolism study of rhubarb decoction in rat using
high-performance liquid chromatography with UV photodiode-array and
mass-spectrometric detection A strategy for systematic analysis of
metabolites from traditional Chinese medicines in biological samples
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB High-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection
(HPLC-DAD) and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used for
separation and identification of metabolites in rat urine bile and
plasma after oral administration of rhubarb decoction Based on the
proposed strategy 91 of the 113 potential metabolites were tentatively
identified or characterized Besides anthraquinones metabolites gallic
acid (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin metabolites were also detected
and characterized in these biological samples Our results indicated
that glucuronidation and sulfation were the main metabolic pathways
of anthraquinones while methylation glucuronidation and sulfation were
the main metabolic pathways of gallic acid (-)-epicatechin and
(+)-catechin Phase I reactions (e g hydroxylation and reduction) played
a relatively minor role compared to phase II reactions in metabolism
of phenolic compounds of rhubarb decoction The identification and
structure elucidation of these metabolites provided essential data for
further pharmacological and clinical studies of rhubarb and related
preparations Moreover the results of the present Investigations
clearly indicated the relevance and usefulness of the combination of
chromatographic spectrophotometric and mass-spectrometric analysis to
detect and identify metabolites (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights

TI Evaluation of the enantioselectivity of glycogen-based dual chiral
selector systems towards basic drugs in capillary electrophoresis
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB Several chiral reagents including cyclodextrins (CDs) and derivatives
crown ethers proteins chiral surfactants and polymers have been
involved in dual selector systems for enantioseparation of a series
of chiral compounds by capillary electrophoresis (CE) In comparison
to the chiral reagents above-mentioned there is no report concerning
the use of polysaccharides in dual chiral CE system In this paper we
first investigate the enantioselectivity of polysaccharide-based dual
selector systems towards some chiral drugs During our recent work
glycogen belonging to the class of branched polysaccharides has been
used as a novel chiral selector in CE In this study three glycogen-based
dual chiral CE systems have been established for enantiomeric
separations of several racemic basic drugs consisting of duloxetine
cetirizine citalopram sulconazole laudanosine amlodipine propranolol
atenolol and nefopam These three dual systems combined glycogen
(neutral polysaccharide) with chondroitin sulfate A (CSA ionic
polysaccharide) beta-CD and HP-beta-CD respectively It was found that
the dual system of glycogen/CSA exhibited good enantioselective
properties toward the tested drugs More importantly compared to the
single selector systems synergistic effect was observed when glycogen
was used with CSA for most of the analytes This indicated the
enhancement of enantioseparation observed for these analytes in
glycogen/CSA system might be due to some favorable interaction effects
between glycogen and CSA Moreover in order to evaluate the
stereoselectivity of glycogen/CSA the influences of buffer pH and
selector concentration on enantioseparation of the studied drugs were
also investigated (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

TI Research and Application of Visual Detection Based on Quantum Dots
Coupled with Silver Enhancement
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB CdTe quantum dot probe modified with streptavidin ( SA) was synthesized
and prepared. A novel visual detection method based on the quantum dot
coupled with silver enhancement was successfully established. Combined
with the protein microarray analysis technique, this novel method did
well in the detection of the reverse phase protein microarray. To detect
the analytical performance, human IgG was used as a mode in this
experiment. First, human IgG was immobilized on Aldehyde slides, then
the optimized bio-goat anti-human IgG and CdTe-SA probe was added,
finally silver enhancement coloration was carried out for 15 min. The
results showed a good linear correlation between the signal gray level
and the logarithm of human IgG immobilized on slides from 100 pg to
1.6 ng with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.997 while its lowest
detectable limit was about 50 pg human IgG. This novel method could
be used to the sensitive detection of micro-amount protein and showed
the characteristics of the simple operation, lower request to the
instruments and the visual results.

TI Food effect on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir from dispersible
tablets following oral administration in healthy Chinese volunteers
SO ARZNEIMITTEL-FORSCHUNG-DRUG RESEARCH
AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of
food on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir (CAS 142217-69-4) from
dispersible tablets.
Methods: In an open-label, two-way crossover study, 12 healthy Chinese
volunteers randomly received a single oral dose of 1 mg entecavir
dispersible tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Blood samples were
collected and determined for pharmacokinetic analyses. A solid phase
extraction for sample preparation and a LC/MS method were developed
and validated for determination of entecavir in human plasma.
Results: The absorption of entecavir from dispersible tablets was
altered significantly with food intake, as evidenced by a decrease in
C m of 63%, a decrease in AUC(0-t) of 22%, and a delay in T-max of 1.5
h. The calibration curve was linear from 0.2 to 25 ng/mL, with a lower
limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.2 ng/mL.
Conclusion: Food intake has an obvious effect on the absorption of
entecavir from dispersible tablets. It is better to take entecavir
dispersible tablets on an empty stomach.

TI In Vitro Mitochondrial Toxicity of Metacavir, a New Nucleoside Reverse
Transcriptase Inhibitor for Treatment of Hepatitis B Virus
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Therapy with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) can
be associated with mitochondrial toxicity. In vitro studies have been
used to predict the predisposition for and characterize the mechanisms
causing mitochondrial toxicity. Metacavir (PNA) is a novel synthetic
nucleoside analog for oral administration with potent and specific
antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). We assessed the
potential for mitochondrial toxicity of PNA in long-term cultures of
HepG2 hepatoma cells by measuring mitochondrial function (through
lactate secretion), levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and the
activities of respiratory-chain complexes I to IV. Exposure of HepG2
cells to PNA at concentrations up to 50 mu M for 15 days resulted in
no deleterious effect on cell proliferation, levels of lactate or
mtDNA, or enzyme activities of respiratory-chain complexes I to IV.
In contrast, dideoxycytosine at 10 mu M and zidovudine at 50 mu M have
significant effects on cell proliferation, levels of lactate and mtDNA,
and enzyme activities of respiratory-chain complexes I to IV. However,
PNA at a supratherapeutic concentration of 250 mu M could result in
significant alterations in the levels of mtDNA and the activities of
respiratory-chain complex enzymes, revealing evidence of the potential
mitochondrial toxicity of PNA. In summary, these in vitro results
indicate that the potential for PNA to interfere with mitochondrial
functions is low.

TI HZ08, a great regulator to reverse multidrug resistance via cycle
arrest and apoptosis sensitization in MCF-7/ADM
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB In early studies, it was demonstrated that R-HZ08, S-HZ08 and the
racemate had strong reverse efficacy of multidrug resistance in vitro
and in vivo (Yan et al., 2008b). The effect was supposed to have direct
interaction with multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) in
MCF-7/ADM and P-glycoprotein in K562/A02. According to our latest
study, we found HZ08 could enhance chemotherapy induced apoptosis by
synergistic action on reactive oxygen species generation, GSH
depletion, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization,
cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Moreover, the potential
selective effect of HZ08 on resistant cells suggested that HZ08 have
specific targets for resistance reversal via apoptosis regulation.
Therefore, we traced individual influence of HZ08, not only on
apoptosis pathway per se but also on apoptosis related intracellular
regulation systems. Then we found HZ08 could increase cells in
G(0)/G(1) phase and regulate apoptosis related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax)
as well as upstream functional molecules (c-Myc and c-Fos), which are
usually abnormal in malignancy and responsible for multidrug
resistance in MCF-7/ADM. Thereby, chemotherapy induced apoptosis was
promoted. R-HZ08 showed better effect than S-HZ08 or the racemate did
in most of targets above. Furthermore, HZ08 did not change the
concentration of intracellular Ca2+ which means it would not have side
effect as verapamil does. Considering multidrug resistance is
multifactorial, HZ08, especially R-HZ08, which could sensitize
apoptosis by multiple improvements of upstream malignant characters,
will be a promising drug to enhance the effect of chemotherapy in the
treatment of multidrug resistant tumor. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Four series of dihydropyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines and
benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines were designed and synthesized as
dual KSP and Aurora-A kinase inhibitors for anti-cancer agents by
introducing some fragments of Aurora-A kinase inhibitors into our KSP
inhibitor CPUYL064. A total of 19 target compounds were evaluated by
two related enzyme inhibition assays and a cytotoxicity assay in vitro.
The results showed that some target compounds could inhibit both
enzymes, and several of them showed significant inhibition activity
against HCT116 cell line. Despite showing moderate KSP and Aurora-A
kinase inhibition, the lead compounds 6a and 6e displayed significant
cytotoxic activity in the micromolar range, especially against the
HCT116 cell line and HepG2 cell line. The results may be useful for
developing a new class of inhibitors having a dual function, KSP
inhibition and Aurora-A kinase inhibition, for the treatment of cancer.

TI Tumor Angiogenesis Inhibitors
SO PROGRESS IN CHEMISTRY
AB At present, drug inhibition of angiogenesis has become a hot topic in
the treatment of tumor and several tumor angiogenesis inhibitors (TAIs)
have been marketed. TAIs can suppress tumor growth and metastasis, and
even induce tumor regression. Research and development on TAIs holds
the promise of supplying drugs with high potency, low toxicity and
broad-spectrum antitumor activity for tumor patients. This review
summarizes recent research progress in TAIs. First of all, indirect
TAIs are introduced. Among indirect TAIs, VEGF inhibitors are the most
successful TAIs currently. Secondly, direct TAIs, which are unlikely
switch on the angiogenic rescue program, are introduced. Thirdly, in
the miscellaneous TAIs part, thalidomide and its derivatives, whose
mechanisms of activity have not been defined well, are described in
detail. Finally, several problems encountered in the research and
development of TAIs, such as challenge from novel theory of
anti-angiogenenic therapy and resistance, are analyzed and discussed,
and future research directions are pointed out.

TI Protein Kinase C Pathway is Involved in the Inhibition by Crocetin of
Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Proliferation
SO PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB Crocetin is a natural carotenoid compound isolated from Gardenia
jasminoids Ellis. Our previous study showed that crocetin inhibits
angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced proliferation of vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMCs). The present study investigated the involvement
of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway in the growth-inhibitory action
of crocetin in VSMCs. The findings showed that PKC activity in the
membrane fraction of VSMCs increased following stimulation with Ang
II, which was suppressed significantly by pretreating the cells with
crocetin. Inhibition of PKC activity by crocetin appeared to be
associated with growth inhibition in VSMCs, because chelerythrine
chloride, a specific PKC inhibitor, likewise decreased cell
proliferation. PKC-alpha, a conventional PKC isoform, was detected in
bovine aorta VSMCs by RT-PCR and western blotting analysis. Crocetin
inhibited Ang II-induced membrane translocation of PKC-alpha, and the
inhibition of crocetin on PKC activity in membrane fraction coincided
with its suppression on membrane translocation of PKC-alpha. In
addition, Ang II-induced mRNA expressions of c-fos, c-jun and c-myc
were also decreased by crocetin. Taken together, the data suggest that
the inhibition by crocetin of PKC activity, at least in part due to
inactivation of PKC-alpha, and the subsequent suppression of
proto-oncogene expressions might mediate its inhibitory effect on
VSMCs proliferation. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Octreotide-modification enhances the delivery and targeting of
doxorubicin-loaded liposomes to somatostatin receptors expressing
tumor in vitro and in vivo
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Octreotide is believed to be the ligand of somatostatin receptors
(SSTRs) which are widely used in tumor diagnosis and clinical therapy.
In the present work, a new targeting conjugate,
octreotide-polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine
(Oct-PEG-PE), was developed for the assembling of liposome, and the
effect of octreotide-modification on the enhancement of the delivery
and targeting of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes was investigated in
vitro and in vivo. Oct-PEG-PE was synthesized by a three-step reaction
involving two derivative intermediate formations of bis (p-nitrophenyl
carbonate)-PEG ((pNP)(2)-PEG) and pNP-PEG-PE. The Oct-modified and
unmodified liposomes (DOX-OL and DOX-CL) were prepared by the ammonium
sulfate gradient method. Both drug uptake assay and cell apoptosis
assay suggested that DOX-OL noticeably increased the uptake of DOX in
SMMC-7721 cells and showed a more significant cytotoxicity, compared
with DOX-CL. The effect of DOX-OL was remarkably inhibited by free
octreotide. In contrast, no significant difference in drug cytotoxicty
was found between DOX-OL and DOX-CL in CHO cells without obvious
expression of SSTRs. The study of ex vivo fluorescence tissues imaging
of BALB/c mice and in vivo tissue distribution of B16 tumor-bearing
mice indicated that DOX-OL caused remarkable accumulation of DOX in
melanoma tumors and the pancreas, in which the SSTRs are highly
expressed.

nanoparticles (SLNs) by a modified emulsion/solvent evaporation method
for transdermal delivery. Five independent processing parameters
including the lipid matrix, emulsifiers, co-emulsifiers,

to enhance the entrapment of DNa. The SLNs produced by optimal
formulation were submicrometre size with low polydispersity index, the
entrapment efficiency was about 89% and the drug loading was about 9.5%.
Shape and surface morphology were determined by transmission electron
microscopy, which revealed the fairly spherical and core-shell shapes
of the SLNs. The in vitro release of SLNs showed a two-step release
pattern: one initial burst release followed by a second slow-release
phase. In the in vitro cutaneous permeation studies, value of flux
obtained for DNa solution was higher than that of SLNs suspension. SLNs
had also been shown to improve the dermal localization of DNa.</.

AB Otilonium bromide (OB) degrades rapidly in plasma and readily undergoes
hydrolysis by the plasma esterase. In this paper, an LC-ESI-MS method
has been developed for the determination of OB in human plasma. The
rapid degradation of OB in plasma was well prevented by immediate
addition of potassium fluoride (KF, an inhibitor of plasma esterase)
to the freshly collected plasma before prompt treatment with
acetonitrile. The method was validated over the concentration range
of 0.1-20 ng/ml. The data of intra-run and inter-run precision and
accuracy were within +/- 15%. The mean extraction recoveries for OB
and the internal standard were higher than 93.0% and the matrix effects
were negligible. The method has been successfully used in a

TI Norisoboldine Inhibits the Production of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines
in Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells by Down-Regulating
the Activation of MAPKs but Not NF-kappa B
SO INFLAMMATION
AB Norisoboldine is the main isoquinoline alkaloid occurring in Radix
Linderae, the dry roots of Lindera aggregata (Lauraceae family). It
has been previously implicated to be able to ameliorate the synovial
inflammation and abnormal immune conditions in collagen-induced
arthritis of mice. To get insight to the potential anti-inflammatory
mechanisms of this alkaloid compound, the present study was undertaken
to explore the effects of norisoboldine on the production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages stimulated by
lipopolysaccharide. In vitro, norisoboldine substantially reduced the
production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as
well as interleukin (IL)-1 beta from RAW264.7 macrophage cells in a
concentration-dependent manner, whereas it only slightly reduced the
production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at both protein and transcription
levels. Of note, the preventive effects of norisoboldine on the release
of pro-inflammatory cytokines were correlated with the inhibitory
action on the phosphorylations of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinases including p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and
c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), but not on the activation and
translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). It can be
therefore concluded that norisoboldine inhibits the macrophage
activation and the resultant production of pro-inflammatory cytokines

TI Direct fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in Escherichia coli
with a target-specific quantum dot-based molecular beacon
SO BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
AB Quantum dots (QDs) are inorganic fluorescent nanocrystals with
excellent properties such as tunable emission spectra and
photo-bleaching resistance compared with organic dyes, which make them
appropriate for applications in molecular beacons. In this work,
quantum dot-based molecular beacons (QD-based MBs) were fabricated to
specifically detect beta-lactamase genes located in pUC18 which were
responsible for antibiotic resistance in bacteria Escherichia coil (E.
coli) DH5 alpha. QD-based MBs were constructed by conjugating
mercaptoacetic acid-quantum dots (MAA-QDs) with black hole quencher
2 (BHQ2) labeled thiol DNA vial metal-thiol bonds. Two types of
molecular beacons, double-strands beacons and hairpin beacons, were
observed in product characterization by gel electrophoresis. Using
QD-based MBs, one-step FISH in tiny bacteria DH5a was realized for the
first time. QD-based MBs retained their bioactivity when hybridizing
with complementary target DNA, which showed excellent advantages of
eliminating background noise caused by adsorption of non-specific
bioprobes and achieving clearer focus of genes in plasmids pUC18, and
capability of bacterial cell penetration and signal specificity in
one-step in situ hybridization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Enhanced Oral Absorption of Paclitaxel in N-Deoxycholic Acid-N,
O-Hydroxyethyl Chitosan Micellar System
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB The overall goal of this study was to develop a micellar system of
paclitaxel (PTX) to enhance its oral absorption. An amphiphilic
chitosan derivative, N-deoxycholic acid-N, O-hydroxyethyl chitosan
(DHC), was synthesized and characterized by FTIR, H-1 NMR, elemental
analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The degree of
substitution (DS) of hydroxyethyl group and deoxycholic acid group
ranged from 89.5-114.5% and 1.11-8.17%, respectively. The critical
micelle concentration (CMC) values of DHC decreased from 0.26 to 0.16
mg/mL as the DS of deoxycholic acid group increased. PTX was
successfully loaded in DHC micelles with a high drug loading (31.68
+/- 0.14%) and entrapment efficiency (77.57 +/- 0.51%). The particle
size of PTX-loaded DHC micelles ranged from 203.35 +/- 2.19 to 236.70
+/- 3.40 nm as the DS of deoxycholic acid group increased. After orally
administration of PTX-loaded DHC micelles, the bioavailability was
threefold compared with that of an orally dosed Taxol (R). The
single-pass intestinal perfusion studies (SPIP) showed that the
intestinal absorption of micelles was via endocytosis involving a
saturable process and a p-glycoprotein (P-gp)-independent way. All
these indicated that the DHC micelles might be a promising tool for
oral delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI Optimized Preparation, Characterization and Biodistribution in Heart
of Breviscapine Lipid Emulsion
SO CHEMICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB Breviscapine is a Traditional Chinese Medicine treating cardiovascular
diseases by promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. The
major active component of breviscapine has low aqueous solubility, poor
chemical stability, short biological half-life and rapid elimination
rate from the plasma. The use of a lipid emulsion formulation containing
breviscapine might improve chemical stability, increase drug loading,
exhibit sustained release profile. In the present study, we developed
an optimized formulation and technological method for the preparation
of sterile and stable breviscapine lipid emulsion (Bre-LE) for
intravenous infusion. The average particle size, polydispersity index,
zeta potential, stability constant (K-s) value and content of final
product were (225.3 +/- 8.8)nm, 0.221 +/- 0.020, (-29.6 +/- 1.5) mV,
(24.3 +/- 2.9)% and (94.5 +/- 0.6)% respectively (n=3). The results
of in vitro release experiment suggest that lipid emulsion as
breviscapine carrier showed a desirable sustained release profile.
Dilution stability and long-term stability were also researched in the
present paper. The results show the carrier could protect drug from
degradation after dilution by phosphate buffered saline and fetal calf
serum. And Bre-LE was stable for up to 6 months at room temperature
storage condition. The biodistribution of drug in heart of mice
increased dramatically after encapsulation into lipid emulsion which
was beneficial to heart disease therapy.

TI Expression and Purification of an Antitumor-Analgesic Peptide from the
Venom of Mesobuthus martensii Karsch by Small Ubiquitin-Related
Modifier Fusion in Escherichia coli
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS
AB To prevent protein aggregation, some proteins are usually expressed
as fusion proteins from which target proteins can be released by
proteolytic or chemical reagents. In this report, small
ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) linked with a hexa-histidine tag was
used as a fusion partner for the antitumor-analgesic peptide from the
venom of Buthus martensii (Karsch) scorpion (AGAP). The optimal
expression level of the soluble fusion protein, SUMO-AGAP, was up to
40% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by
Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease
(Ulp1) to obtain the recombinant AGAP (rAGAP), which was further
purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The purified final product
was >95% pure by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250.
Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the protein to be 7142.63 Dalton,
which equaled the theoretically expected mass. N-terminal sequencing
of rAGAP showed the sequence corresponded to the native protein. MTT
assay indicated the rAGAP could significantly inhibit the
proliferation of Jurkat and Hut 78 T lymphoma cell lines. The further
writhing experiment showed that the rAGAP had an intensive analgesic
effect. The expression strategy presented in this study allows
convenient high yield and easy purification of the rAGAP with native
sequences. (C) 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

SO SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
AB As a new family of nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit
unique properties such as their capacity to penetrate into the cells
and low immunogenicity, which have attracted increasing attention in
biomedical field and make their application in drug and gene transfer
systems being possible. So getting more information about the
interaction of CNTs with biomacromolecules is crucial for further
investigation of CNTs in therapeutic applications. The interaction
between CNTs and BSA under physiological condition was investigated
by fluorescence quenching, synchronous fluorescence and red edge
excitation shift (REES)method. The results showed that CNTs could
significantly decrease the fluorescence intensity of BSA. While the
results of synchronous fluorescence and REES indicated that CNTs almost
had no influence on the conformation of BSA. So the authors concluded
that the mechanism of interaction between CNTs and BSA was non-specific
adsorption.

TI Characterization and identification of saponins in Achyranthes
bidentata by rapid-resolution liquid chromatography with electrospray
ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry
SO RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB A rapid-resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC) method coupled with
electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass
spectrometry (Q-TOF MS/MS) has been developed for analysis of
oleanane-type triterpenoid saponins in Achyranthes bidentata.
Collision-induced dissociation techniques were used to fragment the
precursor molecular ions and the resulting product ions. A
retro-Diels-Alder rearrangement from the oleanane aglycone skeleton
in the MS/MS process yielded characteristic fragment ions in positive
ion mode. These characteristic ions were helpful in predicting the
aglycone structure. Losses of monosaccharide sequences, presence of
sugar-chain fragment ions, and cleavage of CO2 were observed for
important information on sugar types and attachment sequences.
Fragmentation rules of three major groups of saponins from A. bidentata
were summarized, and the possible fragmentation pathways were
proposed. A total of 22 compounds including both the target and unknown
oleanane-type triterpenoid saponins were rapidly screened and
predicted in the herbal extract by the developed method. The RRLC-Q-TOF
MS/MS method has provided a powerful approach for rapid separation,
target screening and structural elucidation of oleanane-type saponins,
and also opened perspectives for similar studies on other herbal
medicines. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Identification of an intermediate signature that marks the initial
phases of the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma transition
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB The colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence describes the stepwise
progression from normal to dysplastic epithelium and then to carcinoma.
Only a small proportion of colorectal adenomas (CRAs) progress to
colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). Endoscopic intervention is currently
being used on patients with high grade dysplasia CRAs, with diameters
of >1 cm, or villous components of >25% who are at higher risk than
other CRA sufferers. During the process, biopsy samples are taken for
conventional histological diagnosis, but poor pathomorphological
sensitivity and specificity greatly limit the diagnostic accuracy.
Unfortunately, there are no reliable molecular criteria available that
can predict the potential development of CRA to CRC. Gene expression
profiles of normal colorectal mucosa (NOR), CRA and different Dukes'
stages of CRC biopsy specimens, which represent the gradual progress
of the CRA to CRC sequence, were determined by Affymetrix technology.
Representative regulated genes were further analyzed by quantitative
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Intersectional analyses of discriminative expression signatures of CRC
vs. CRA and CRA vs. NOR allowed the identification of an intermediate
signature of 463 probe sets (psets) that mark the NOR -> CRA -> CRC
progression. This signature represents a reservoir of candidate
markers for the early diagnosis of higher-risk CRA, thus allowing for
timely therapeutic intervention and more selective treatment. A
further 279 CRC-specific psets pointing to the malignant transition
from CRA to CRC were identified and these could represent potential
therapeutic targets for CRC. The reliability of the results was further
confirmed by qRT-PCR and IHC analyses of the 4-gene sets randomly
selected from the 463 psets.

TI Antiobesity and Antihyperglycemic Effects of Ginsenoside Rb1 in Rats
SO DIABETES
AB OBJECTIVE Obesity and type 2 diabetes are national and worldwide
epidemics. Because currently available antiobesity and antidiabetic
drugs have limited efficacy and/or safety concerns, identifying new
medicinal agents, such as ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) as reported here,
offers exciting possibilities for future development of successful
antiobesity and antidiabetic therapies.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Changes in feeding behavior after acute
intraperitoneal administration of Rb1 and the effects of
intraperitoneal Rb1 for 4 weeks on body weight, energy expenditure,
and glucose tolerance in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats were
assessed. We also examined the effects of Rb1 on signaling pathways
and neuropeptides in the hypothalamus.
RESULTS Acute intraperitoneal Rb1 dose-dependently suppressed food
intake without eliciting signs of toxicity. This inhibitory effect on
feeding may be mediated by central mechanisms because Rb1 stimulated
c-Fos expression in brain areas involved in energy homeostasis.
Consistent with this, Rb1 activated the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/Airt signaling pathway and inhibited NPY gene expression in
the hypothalamus. Four-week administration of Rb1 significantly
reduced food intake, body weight gain, and body fat content and
increased energy expenditure in HFD-induced obese rats. Rb1 also
significantly decreased fasting blood glucose and improved glucose
tolerance, and these effects were greater than those observed in
pair-fed rats, suggesting that although Rb1's antihyperglycemic effect
is partially attributable to reduced food intake and body weight; there
may be additional effects of Rb1 on glucose homeostasis.
CONCLUSIONS These results identify Rb1 as an antiobesity and
antihyperglycemic agent. Diabetes 59:2505-2512, 2010

TI Synthesis and biological evaluation of furoxan-based nitric
oxide-releasing derivatives of glycyrrhetinic acid as
anti-hepatocellular carcinoma agents
SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB A series of novel furoxan-based nitric oxide (NO)-releasing
derivatives of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) were designed, synthesized,
and evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-tumor liver cells. Five
furoxan/GA hybrids, 7b-d, 7f, and 7g, displayed potent cytotoxicity
against HCC cells (IC50: 0.25-1.10 mu M against BEL-7402 cells and
1.32-6.78 mu M against HepG2 cells), but had a little effect on the
growth of LO2 cells, indicating that these compounds had selective
cytotoxicity against HCC cells. Furthermore, these compounds produced
high concentrations of NO in HCC cells, but low in LO2 cells and
treatment with hemoglobin partially reduced the cytotoxicity of the
hybrid in HCC cells. Apparently, the high concentrations of NO produced
by NO donor moieties and the bioactivity of GA synergistically
contribute to the cytotoxicity, but the NO is a major player against
HCC cells in vitro. Potentially, our findings may aid in the design
of new chemotherapeutic reagents for the intervention of human HCC at
clinic. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Regulation of NF-E2-Related Factor 2 Signaling for Cancer
Chemoprevention: Antioxidant Coupled with Antiinflammatory
SO ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING
AB Cancer chemoprevention is a process of using either natural or
synthetic compounds to reduce the risk of developing cancer.
Observations that NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-deficient mice lack
response to some chemopreventive agents point to the important role
of Nrf2 in chemoprevention. Nrf2 is a member of basic-leucine zipper
transcription factor family and has been shown to regulate gene
expression by binding to a response element, antioxidant responsive
element. It is generally believed that activation of Nrf2 signaling
is an adaptive response to the environmental and endogenous stresses.
Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 is suppressed by association with
Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), but is stimulated upon
exposure to oxidative or electrophilic stress. Once activated, Nrf2
translocates into nuclei and upregulates a group of genes that act in
concert to combat oxidative stress. Nrf2 is also shown to have
protective function against inflammation, a pathological process that
could contribute to carcinogenesis. In this review, we will discuss
the current progress in the study of Nrf2 signaling, in particular,
the mechanisms of Nrf2 activation by chemopreventive agents. We will
also discuss some of the potential caveats of Nrf2 in cancer treatment
and future opportunity and challenges on regulation of Nrf2-mediated
antioxidant and antiinflammatory signaling in the context of cancer
prevention. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 13, 1679-1698.

TI Integral pharmacokinetics of multiple lignan components in normal,

rats and correlations with hepatic injury biomarkers
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Although pharmacokinetic alternations by hepatic injury have been
extensively studied, little is known about the potential influence of
hepatoprotective agent's treatment. This study was aimed to
investigate the holistic pharmacokinetics of multiple lignans, CYP3A
regulations, and their correlations with hepatic injury biomarkers,
in hepatic Injured rats pretreated with or without schisandra lignan
extract (SLE) and dimethyl-diphenyl-bicarboxylate (DDB). Integral
pharmacokinetics of multiple lignans based on an AUC-weighting
approach was determined in normal, CCl4 induced hepatic injury rats
pretreated with or without SLE and DDB Protein expression and
activities of CYP3A were determined Pharmacokinetic parameters and
CYP3A activities were correlated with serum alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. CCl4 induced acute
hepatic injury resulted in a nearly 8-fold enhancement of integral
plasma exposures of multiple lignans, which was caused by the
significant down-regulation of CYP3A. SLE and DDB pretreatment
exhibited potent hepatoprotective effects, accompanied with the
restored expression and activity of CYP3A, and the recovery of the
respective and integral pharmacokinetics of lignans components. The
integral AUC(0-tn) and CYP3A activities correlated well with ALT and
AST. This study suggested that the pharmacokinetic regulating effects
of hepatoprotective agent's on themselves and co-prescribed drugs
should be of concern, and hepatic injury biomarkers may serve as good

TI Proliferation of retinal pigment epithelial cells induced by
(R,R)-XY-10 and (S,S)-XY-10 and their action mechanisms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB AIM: To investigate the mechanism of proliferation effect induced by
(R,R)-XY-10 and (S,S)-XY-10 on retinal pigmented epithelial cells
(ARPE-19).
METHODS: Human retinal pigmented epithelial cells (ARPE-19) and human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to investigate the
effect of (R,R)-XY-10 and (S,S)-XY-10 on cell growth, and their
mechanisms of proliferative action by using ERK, AKT, PI3K, Protein
kinase C (PKC) and Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors.
RESULTS: (R,R)-XY-10 and (S,S)-XY-10 dose-dependently increased
ARPE-19 cell proliferation, but not on HUVECs. When treated with
proliferative inhibitors, H-7 (5 mu mol/L), hyperidn (20 mu mol/L),
PD98059 (2 mu mol/L), LY294002 (50 mu mol/L), SH-5 (10 mu mol/L) and
L-NAME (100 mu mol/L), the proliferative effect was reduced by H-7,
hyperidn, PD98059 and LY294002, but not by SH-5 and L-NAME.
CONCLUSION: (R,R)-XY-10 and (S,S)-XY-10 can induce cell proliferation
through MAPK and PI3K dependent pathway.

TI Central Administration of Kisspeptin-10 Inhibits Water and Sodium
Excretion of Anesthetized Male Rats and the Involvement of Arginine
Vasopressin
SO ENDOCRINE RESEARCH
AB Aim. To investigate the effect of hypothalamus kisspeptin on water and
sodium excretion and the possible mechanism. Method. The
intracerebroventricular (icv) administration and radioimmunoassay
were used to observe the effect of kisspeptin-10 on urine flow, sodium
and potassium excretion, plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), and atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations in anesthetized male rats.
The mediation of renal sympathetic nerve was also investigated by
studies conducted on rats with bilateral renal sympathetic
denervation. Results. The urine flow, sodium excretion, and free water
clearance decreased significantly by icv injection of 5 nmol
kisspeptin-10 (p < 0.05) from 30 to 60 min post-injection. Meanwhile,
plasma AVP concentrations increased significantly 30 min after the icv
injection of 5 nmol kisspeptin-10 (p < 0.05), whereas the equal dose
of kisspeptin-10 did not significantly change plasma ANP
concentrations. The mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and
potassium excretion did not significantly change during the
experiment. Furthermore, pretreatment with 5 nmol kisspeptin-10 could
still significantly decrease urine flow and sodium excretion in renal
sympathetic denervated rats. Conclusion. Central administration of
kisspeptin-10 could inhibit sodium excretion and urine flow in
anesthetized male rats, which is probably mediated by increasing the
plasma AVP concentration and is independent of plasma ANP concentration
and renal sympathetic nerve activity.

TI Microsomal Cytochrome P450-Mediated Metabolism of Protopanaxatriol
Ginsenosides: Metabolite Profile, Reaction Phenotyping, and
Structure-Metabolism Relationship
SO DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION
AB Although the biotransformation of ginsenosides in the gastrointestinal
tract has been extensively studied, much less is known about hepatic
cytochrome P450 (P450)-catalyzed metabolism. The major aims of this
study were to clarify the metabolic pathway and P450 isoforms involved
and to explore the structure-metabolism relationship of
protopanaxatriol (PPT)-type ginsenosides in hepatic microsomes.
Efficient depletion of ginsenoside Rh1, Rg2, Rf, and PPT was found,
whereas the elimination of Re and Rg1, characterized by a glucose
substitution at the C20 hydroxy group, was negligible in microsomal
incubation systems. Based on high-performance liquid chromatography
hybrid ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, the
oxygenation metabolism on the C20 aliphatic branch chain was identified
as the predominant metabolic pathway of PPT ginsenosides in both human
and rat hepatic microsomes. By a comparison with authentic standards,
the C24-25 double bond was identified as one of the oxygenation sites
to produce the metabolites of C20-24 epoxide (ocotillol-type
ginsenosides). Both chemical inhibition and human recombinant P450
isoform assays indicated that CYP3A4 was the predominant isozyme
responsible for the oxygenation metabolism of PPT ginsenosides. Enzyme
kinetic evaluations in rat and human hepatic microsomes and human
recombinant CYP3A4 isozyme incubation systems showed generally
consistent results in that the intrinsic clearance ranked as Rf <= Rg2
< Rh1 < PPT, closely correlating with logP values and the number of
glycosyl substitutions. Results obtained from this study suggest that
CYP3A4-catalyzed oxygenation metabolism plays an important role in the
hepatic disposition of ginsenosides and that glycosyl substitution,
especially at the C20 hydroxy group, determines their intrinsic
clearances by CYP3A4.

TI Development of a Systematic Approach to Identify Metabolites for Herbal
Homologs Based on Liquid Chromatography Hybrid Ion Trap Time-of-Flight
Mass Spectrometry: Gender-Related Difference in Metabolism of
Schisandra Lignans in Rats
SO DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION
AB Metabolic research for herbal medicine (HM) is a formidable task, which
is still in its infancy due to complicated components in HM, complex
metabolic pathways, and lack of authentic standards. The present work
contributes to the development of a powerful technical platform to
rapidly identify and classify metabolites of herbal components based
on a liquid chromatography hybrid ion trap time-of-flight mass
spectrometry. Taking Schisandra lignans extract as an example, the
metabolic studies were completed both in vitro and in vivo. In the in
vitro study, metabolites for five representative Schisandra lignans
were identified and structurally characterized. The major metabolic
pathways were summed as demethylation, hydroxylation, and
demethylation and hydroxylation. In the in vivo study, 44 metabolites
were detected in rat urine. These metabolites were identified and
classified rapidly according to the metabolic rules obtained in the
in vitro studies, and hydroxylation was confirmed as the primacy
metabolic pathway for lignans in rat urine. In addition, "relative
cumulative excretion" (RCE) for the metabolites in female and male rats
were calculated according to their relative intensities in the urine
samples collected at 0 to 12, 12 to 24, and 24 to 36 h. As a result,
great gender-related difference on RCE was observed. For most
metabolites, RCE in female rats was significantly lower than that in
male rats. In conclusion, the presently developed methodology and
approach on metabolic research for Schisandra lignans will find its
wide use in metabolic studies for herbal medicines.

TI Extensive Intestinal First-Pass Elimination and Predominant Hepatic
Distribution of Berberine Explain Its Low Plasma Levels in Rats
SO DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION
AB Berberine, one of the most commonly used natural products, exhibits
a poor plasma concentration-effect relationship whose underlying
mechanisms remain largely unclear. This study was designed to test the
hypothesis that extensive first-pass elimination and abundant tissue
distribution of berberine may be its specific pharmacokinetic
properties. For that, four different dosing routes, intragastric,
intraduodenal, intraportal, and intravenous, were used to investigate
the gastric, intestinal, and hepatic first-pass elimination of
berberine. After intragastric dosing, approximately half of berberine
ran intact through the gastrointestinal tract and another half was
disposed of by the small intestine, leading to an extremely low extent
of absolute oral bioavailability in rats (0.36%). Moreover, the major
berberine metabolites were identified and quantified in rat enterocyte
S9 fractions, portal vein plasma, and intestinal perfusates; plasma
concentrations and tissue distribution of berberine and its major
metabolites were determined as well. Data indicated that M1, M2
glucuronide, and M3 were the major metabolites generated from the small
intestine and that there was a 70-fold increase in the ratio of the
area under the concentration-time curve value for berberine (liver
versus plasma). We conclude that intestinal first-pass elimination of
berberine is the major barrier of its oral bioavailability and that
its high extraction and distribution in the liver could be other
important factors that lead to its low plasma levels in rats.

TI Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of
1,5-Diaryl-1,2,4-triazole Derivatives as Selective Cyclooxygenase-2
Inhibitors
SO ARCHIV DER PHARMAZIE
AB A series of 1,5-diaryl-1,2,4-triazole derivatives were synthesized and
evaluated as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. The results of the
preliminary biological assays in vivo showed that eight compounds 5b,
6b, 6c, 7c, 8b, 8d, 9c, and 9d have potent anti-inflammatory activity
(P < 0.01), while compounds 6b, 6c, and 9c exhibit marked potency.
Compound 6c was then selected for further investigation. In the COX
inhibition assay in vitro, compound 6c was identified as a potent and
selective inhibitor of COX-2 (COX-2 IC50 = 0.37 mu M; SI = 0.018), being
equipotent to celecoxib (COX-2 IC50 = 0.26 mu M; SI = 0.015). In a rat
carrageenan-induced paw edema assay, 6c exhibited moderate
anti-inflammatory activity (35% inhibition of inflammation) at 2 h
after administration of 15 mg/kg as an oral dose. A docking study also
revealed that compound 6c binds in the active site of COX-2 in a similar
mode to that of the known selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-558.

TI Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients Sensitive and Resistant to Imatinib
Treatment Show Different Metabolic Responses
SO PLOS ONE
AB The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is highly effective for
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, some patients gradually
develop resistance to imatinib, resulting in therapeutic failure.
Metabonomic and genomic profiling of patients' responses to drug
interventions can provide novel information about the in vivo
metabolism of low-molecular-weight compounds and extend our insight
into the mechanism of drug resistance. Based on a multi-platform of
high-throughput metabonomics, SNP array analysis, karyotype and
mutation, the metabolic phenotypes and genomic polymorphisms of CML
patients and their diverse responses to imatinib were characterized.
The untreated CML patients (UCML) showed different metabolic patterns
from those of healthy controls, and the discriminatory metabolites
suggested the perturbed metabolism of the urea cycle, tricarboxylic
acid cycle, lipid metabolism, and amino acid turnover in UCML. After
imatinib treatment, patients sensitive to imatinib (SCML) and patients
resistant to imatinib (RCML) had similar metabolic phenotypes to those
of healthy controls and UCML, respectively. SCML showed a significant
metabolic response to imatinib, with marked restoration of the
perturbed metabolism. Most of the metabolites characterizing CML were
adjusted to normal levels, including the intermediates of the urea
cycle and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). In contrast, neither
cytogenetic nor metabonomic analysis indicated any positive response
to imatinib in RCML. We report for the first time the associated genetic
and metabonomic responses of CML patients to imatinib and show that
the perturbed in vivo metabolism of UCML is independent of imatinib
treatment in resistant patients. Thus, metabonomics can potentially
characterize patients' sensitivity or resistance to drug intervention.

TI Dihydroartemisinin loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (DHA-NLC):
Evaluation of pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution after
intravenous administration to rats
SO PHARMAZIE
AB A simple and rapid LC-MS/MS method was established for the
determination of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in plasma and tissues of
rats. Sample preparation was achieved by liquid liquid extraction with
aether and analysis was performed on LC-MS/MS in positive ion mode using
electrospray ionization (ESI) as an interface. Target compounds were
quantified in a single ion-monitoring (SIM) mode. DHA was monitored
at m/z 267.1 and the internal standard finasteride at m/z 305.2.
Chromatography was carried out using a Synergi fusion RP 80 column with
a mixture of ethanol and 0.1% formic acid mixture (75:25) as the mobile
phase. The pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution after intravenous
administration of DHA in nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) and in
solution were then compared. The mean residence times (MRT) of the
DHA-NLC was much longer than that of the DHA solution. In the tested
organs, the AUC values of the DHA-NLC were higher than that of the DHA
solution in liver, spleen, lung, brain and muscle, and lower than the
DHA solution in heart and kidney. DHA-NLC prepared in this study is
a promising sustained-release and drug-targeting system for antitumor
drugs. It may also allow a reduction in dosage and a decrease in systemic
toxicity.

TI PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A NEW PEPTIDE (S-8300) FROM SHARK
LIVER
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY
AB S-8300, a small (8200.901 Da) antidiabetic peptide, was purified and
characterized from shark livers (Chiloscyllium plagiosum). It was
isolated by extraction of the water-soluble fraction, dialysis,
ultrafiltration and dicthylaminoethyl Sepharose, Bio-Gel P-10 and fast
protein liquid chromatography monoQ chromatography. The new peptide
(S-8300) contained 17 amino acids and the 15 N-terminal amino acid
residues of S-8300 were
NH2-Met-Leu-Val-Gly-Pro-Ile-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Val-Val-Tyr-Glu-Gln-.
The new peptide was stable at 95C for 30 min and stable between pH 3.0
and 9.0. It was not inactivated by DNase and RNase, but totally
inactivated by trypsin and proteinase K digestion. In addition, S-8300
could remarkably protect the structure integrity and recover the damage
of NIT-1 cell after exposure to the toxin of streptozotocin. Homology
search of NH2-terminal sequence showed that S-8300 was a totally new
protein.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
The experiments suggested that S-8300 could reduce the adverse effect
of beta-cell toxins and protect the structure integrity and mitigate
the damage. S-8300 could markedly decrease the level of fasting plasma
glucose, glycohemoglobin-A1, triglyceride, cholesterol, free fatty
acid and malondialdehyde, increased the activity of superoxide
dismutase and attenuated the injury of beta-cell in pancreatic islet.
Therefore, S-8300 has a significant protective effect on diabetes in
mice. These might indicate that S-8300 could have clinical therapy
significance.

SO JOURNAL OF DRUG TARGETING
AB The purpose of this study was to develop and study the behaviors of
bifendate (DDB) liposome in vivo. DDB liposome was prepared by the
rotary evaporationextrusion method. The particle size,
zeta-potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE), and in vitro drug
release from liposome were determined and the in vivo studies were
tested in mice and rats. The concentrations of DDB in plasma and liver
at different sampling time points were determined by RP-HPLC. The liver
concentration time curves of DDB liposome and free drug solution in
mice were determined, and the pharmacokinetic parameters in rats and
mice were calculated and compared by statistical analysis. The average
liposome diameter was 323 +/- 29 nm (n=3) and the EE was 91.52 +/- 2.38%.
There were significantly different parameters of k10 and area under
the plasma concentrationtime curve (AUC(0-T)) between liposome and
solution. The mean residence time (MRT0-T) in plasma of liposomal
formulation was 3.72 times longer than that of solution. Compared with
solution, DDB liposome delivered about 2.57 times higher DDB into
liver. Thus, an optimum intravenous liposonne formulation for DDB could
be developed as an alternative to the commercial DDB preparations.

TI Targeting the Development of Resveratrol as a Chemopreventive Agent
SO DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB Tumor development consists of several separate, but closely linked,
stages: tumor initiation, promotion, and progression. This long and
complex process provides opportunities for intervention both in
preventing cancer initiation and in treating the neoplasm during its
premalignant stages. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound found in
many plant species, including grapes, peanuts, and various herbs, has
recently been investigated intensely for its cancer chemopreventive
property. The present work is an overview of the chemopreventive
mechanisms of resveratrol in anti-initiation, anti-promotion, and
anti-progression. These, together with the low toxicity of
resveratrol, suggest promise for novel chemopreventive agents.
However, the low bioavailability and rapid clearance of resveratrol
from the circulation require the design of new resveratrol-like
chemopreventive agents, the structural modifications and the structure
activity relationship of which are also discussed in this review. Drug

TI Synthesis, self-assembly, and characterization of PEG-coated iron
oxide nanoparticles as potential MRI contrast agent
SO DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRIAL PHARMACY
AB Aim: Investigated the self-assembly and characterization of novel
antifouling polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles
as nanoprobes for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent.
Method: Monodisperse oleic acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide
cores are synthesized by thermal decomposition of iron oleate. The
self-assembly behavior between iron oxide cores and PEG-lipid
conjugates in water and their characteristics are confirmed by
transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction,
thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
and vibrating sample magnetometer. Result: Dynamic light scattering
shows superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with PEG are
stable in water for pH of 3-10 and ionic strengths up to 0.3 M NaCl,
and are protein resistant in physiological conditions. Additionally,
in vitro MRI study demonstrates the efficient magnetic resonance
imaging contrast characteristics of the iron oxide nanoparticles.
Conclusion: The result indicates that the novel antifouling PEG-coated
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles could potentially be used
in a wide range of applications such as biotechnology, MRI, and magnetic
fluid hyperthermia.

and mucoadhesive in situ gelling ophthalmic system of azithromycin
(ATM). Poloxamer 407 (P407) and poloxamer 188 (P188) were used as
gelling agents. Addition of Carbopol 974P (CP 974P) to the gelling
systems could increase the solubility of ATM by salt effect and enhance
the mucoadhesive property of the systems. Gelation temperature of these
systems ranged from 31.21-36.31 degrees C depending on the ratio of
P407 and P188. Mucoadhesion force of the system composed of
P407/P188/CP 974P (21/5/0.3%, w/v) was 2.3-fold that without carbopol
974P. Viscosity of the formulation was in a suitable range at 25 degrees
C and pseudoplastic behavior was observed at 35 degrees C. The
formulation exhibited a 24-h sustained release of ATM. In vivo resident
experiments showed AUC(0-12) of ATM in rabbit tears increased by
1.78-fold for in situ gel compared with eye drop. At 12 h, tear
concentrations exceeded minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
breakpoint for the most common causative pathogens of bacterial
conjunctivitis by 2.8-fold. Results in vitro and in vivo indicated that
this droppable gel performed better than ATM eye drop did.

TI Image-Based Chemical Screening Identifies Drug Efflux Inhibitors in
Lung Cancer Cells
SO CANCER RESEARCH
AB Cancer cells with active drug efflux capability are multidrug resistant
and pose a significant obstacle for the efficacy of chemotherapy.
Moreover, recent evidence suggests that high drug efflux cancer cells
(HDECC) may be selectively enriched with stem-like cancer cells, which
are believed to be the cause for tumor initiation and recurrence. There
is a great need for therapeutic reagents that are capable of eliminating
HDECCs. We developed an image-based high-content screening (HCS)
system to specifically identify and analyze the HDECC population in
lung cancer cells. Using the system, we screened 1,280
pharmacologically active compounds that identified 12 potent HDECC
inhibitors. It is shown that these inhibitors are able to overcome
multidrug resistance (MDR) and sensitize HDECCs to chemotherapeutic
drugs, or directly reduce the tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells
possibly by affecting stem-like cancer cells. The HCS system we
established provides a new approach for identifying therapeutic
reagents overcoming MDR. The compounds identified by the screening may
potentially be used as potential adjuvant to improve the efficacy of
chemotherapeutic drugs. Cancer Res; 70(19); 7723-33. (C) 2010 AACR.

TI A novel compound modified from tanshinone inhibits tumor growth in vivo
via activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB A novel compound, acetyltanshinone IIA (ATA) was obtained from chemical
modifications of tanshinone TIIA (TIIA) isolated from a medicinal
plant, Salvia miltiorrhiza. ATA exhibited increased water solubility
and stronger apoptotic activity on multiple cancer cell lines than
TIIA. ATA displayed a higher growth inhibition ability on breast cancer
especially HER2 positive cells than normal cells and it inhibited
xenografted tumor growth in mice. Mechanistic studies showed that ATA
could induce significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, Bax
translocation to mitochondria, resulting in mitochondria damage,
cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death.
ATA-mediated ROS production and its downstream apoptotic events could
be blocked by an antioxidant agent, propyl gallate, indicating the
prominent role of ROS in ATA-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2
protein reduced ATA-induced cell death. In conclusion, ATA is a novel
anticancer agent with potent in vitro and in vivo anticancer ability.
ROS-mediated Bax activation should be the mechanism by which ATA
induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland

TI Flavonoid baicalein suppresses adhesion, migration and invasion of
MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB Baicalein is a widely used Chinese herbal medicine that has been used
historically in anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer therapy. However,
the molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer activity remains poorly
understood and warrants further investigations. The purpose of this
study is to verify the activity of baicalein to inhibit the invasion
of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The results indicated that
baicalein suppressed MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated
substrate, wound healing migration and invasion through the Matrigel
in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot and gelatin
zymography analysis showed that baicalein significantly inhibited the
expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 (MMP-2/9)
in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with
baicalein down-regulated the expression of MMP-2/9 involved
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway. Taken
together, baicalein had potential to suppress the adhesion, migration
and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells in vitro and it could serve
as a promising drug for the treatment of cancer metastasis. (C) 2010

AB An amorphous formulation of hypocrellin A for photodynamic therapy is
reported which can provide stable aqueous dispersion of such
hydrophobic photosensitizers. In vitro studies have demonstrated the
active uptake of amorphous formulation of hypocrellin A into the
mitochondria of tumor cells. Compared with Tween-80 micelle embedded
hypocrellin A, low dark-toxicity but similar light-toxicity of the

TI Density Functional Theory Study of the Interaction of Carbon Monoxide
with Bimetallic Co-Mn Clusters
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB Using spin-polarized density functional calculations, we have studied
the interaction of carbon monoxide (CO) with bimetallic ConMn (n = 1-6)
and ConMn6-n (n = 0-6) clusters. Various adsorption sites including
atop, hollow, and bridge adsorption patterns and different possible
spin states are considered. The CO molecule prefers to adsorb at the
Co site rather than at the Mn site. Atop adsorption structure is
energetically more favored over the hollow and bridge adsorption ones
for the bimetallic clusters with an exception of Co5Mn. Large
adsorption energy is found at Co3Mn, Co2Mn4, and Co3Mn3, associating
with the relative stability of the bare Co Mn clusters and the
electrostatic interactions as well as adsorption patterns. The
activation of the C-O bond and the red shift of the C-O stretching
frequency are sensitive to the adsorption sites and high chemical
activity is identified for Co-6, Co5Mn, and Mn-6 clusters. More
interestingly, the adsorption of CO has different influence on the
magnetism of the clusters: the magnetic moment remains unchanged for
CoMn and Co2Mn, while it is reduced by 2 mu(B) for ConMn (n = 3-6) and
Co Mn6-n (n = 0-5) and is enhanced by 2 mu(B) for Mn-6 when a CO molecule
is loaded to the cluster.

TI A novel lipoprotein-mimic nanocarrier composed of the modified protein
and lipid for tumor cell targeting delivery
SO JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE
AB Ursodeoxycholic acid (UA) modified protein-lipid nanocomplex (uP-LNC)
as a novel biomimetic nanocarrier was developed for tumor-targeting
delivery. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a model protein and
its amino groups were covalently modified by UA. Lipid nanoparticle
(LNP) composed of phospholipids, triglycerides and octadecylamine was
prepared by using solvent evaporation method and was used as the core.
UA modified BSA (uP) was attached onto the surface of LNP by post-insert
method and generated the protein-lipid nanocomplex. As the control,
cholesteryl hemiglutarate (CH), a non-targeting ligand was also used
to modify BSA and then formed CH modified protein-lipid nanocomplex
(cP-LNC). The combining efficiency of modified BSA with LNP, determined
by Bradford protein assay, increased with the enhancement of
substitution degree. The modified BSA and nanocomplex were
characterized for the substitute degree, average molecular weight,
surface tension, particle size and zeta potential by various
physicochemical analyses. In vitro dissolution tests and cell uptake
studies were performed by loading coumarin-6 as a fluorescent probe.
The results indicated that the UA modified protein attached on the
nanoparticles significantly decreased drug release from the
nanocomplex in pH 7.4 medium, The uptake of uP-LNC was higher in hepatic
carcinoma cells (HepG2 and Bel 7402) than in normal liver cells (L02).
Furthermore, the uptake of uP-LNC was significantly higher than that
of cP-LNC and LNP in these cells. The uptake was dependent on time,
temperature and concentration, and could be inhibited by free UA. In
addition, the MTT assay of uP-LNC and u(x)P with various degrees of
substitution showed very low cytotoxicity at tested concentrations in
all cells. The UA modification served to facilitate the specific
receptor and energy mediated endocytosis process of the protein-lipid
nanocomplex and enabled this nanocomplex to be a potential nanocarrier
for tumor-targeting drug delivery. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI The Mechanism of (R,R) ZX-5 on Increasing NO Release
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB (R,R) ZX-5 has been proven to have positive effects on choroidal blood
flow without affecting the sclera and ciliary bodies in New Zealand
white rabbits. This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms
of (R,R) ZX-5 on improving the choroidal blood flow and promoting NO
production. HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) were used
to determine the production of eNOS, p-eNOS, AKT and Erk1/2 by Western
blot analysis. iNOS and eNOS mRNA levels were investigated by RT-PCR
and the effect of (R,R) ZX-5 on NO production were determined by eNOS
activity assay. We found (R,R) ZX-5 upregulated protein expression of
eNOS and iNOS, increased NO production, and reduced ERK and Akt protein
level. Therefore, (R,R) ZX-5 may promote the choroidal blood flow in
New Zealand white rabbits without affecting the blood flow in the iris
or ciliary bodies via increasing NO production. These results suggest
that (R,R) ZX-5 may function to cure and prevent Age-related macular
degeneration (AMD).

TI Comparison of electron capture-atmospheric pressure chemical
ionization and electrospray ionization for the analysis of gambogic
acid and its main circulating metabolite in dog plasma
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Gambogic acid (GA), a promising anticancer candidate, is a
polyprenylated xanthone abundant in the resin of Garcinia morella and
Garcinia hanburyi. Electron capture-atmospheric pressure chemical
ionization (EC-APCI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) techniques,
both in the negative ion mode, were evaluated regarding ionization,
fragmentation patterns and sensitivity for simultaneous liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of GA and
its main circulating metabolite, 10-hydroxygambogic acid (10-OHGA) in
dog plasma. Both analytes underwent extensive in-source fragmentation
in EC-APCI, which was not desirable for reliable quantification of
these analytes, whereas the substitution of ESI for EC-APCI almost
eliminated the source instability of both analytes. Negative ion ESI
was, therefore, chosen for the development of an LC-MS/MS method for
simultaneous determination of these analytes. After protein
precipitation by acetonitrile, all analytes were separated on a Luna
C18 HST column (50 x 2.0 mm id., 2.5 mu m) with a mobile phase of 20
mmol L-1 ammonium acetate water solution containing 0.2% acetic
acid :acetonitrile (18:82, v/v). The detection was performed on a
tandem mass spectrometer using selective reaction monitoring mode.
Calibration curves were linear over the range of 10-6000 ng mL(-1) for
GA and 3-2000 ng mL(-1) for 10-OHGA. The method was successfully applied
to the pharmacokinetics study of GA injection in six beagle dogs.

TI Asiatic acid preserves beta cell mass and mitigates hyperglycemia in
streptozocin-induced diabetic rats
SO DIABETES-METABOLISM RESEARCH AND REVIEWS
AB Background Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the pancreas
produces little or no insulin due to the loss or dysfunction of
pancreatic beta cells. This study investigated the beneficial effects
of asiatic acid - a triterpenoid compound - preserved beta mass and
mitigated hyperglycemia in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats.
Methods Diabetes mellitus was induced in adult male Wistar rats by a
single intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (60 mg/kg body
weight). The diabetic rats were divided into untreated and asiatic acid
(25 mg/kg) groups. Controls were intraperitoneal injection with
citrate buffer. Blood glucose level, plasma insulin, and pancreas
immunohistochemistry analysis were examined after a 2-week
experimental period. AKT and Bcl-xL expression in the pancreatic islets
of rats were evaluated by Western blot methods.
Results Blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in rats
receiving asiatic acid after streptozocin administration. Asiatic acid
concomitantly increased serum insulin levels in diabetic rats.
Immunohistochemical staining revealed a marked preservation by asiatic
acid of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets of the
diabetic rats. Furthermore, asiatic acid in vivo induced pro-survival
Akt kinase activation and Bcl-xL expression in the pancreatic islets
of diabetic rats.
Conclusions These results suggest that asiatic acid exerts its
glucose-lowering effects, in part through influences on beta-cell
mass. Asiatic acid administration resulted in preservation and
restoration of beta-cell mass and function in diabetic rodent models.

TI SPE and LC for Analysis of the Tissue Distribution of Wogonin and Its
Metabolite in Tumor-Bearing Nude Mice
SO CHROMATOGRAPHIA
AB The tissue distribution of wogonin was investigated for study of its
anticancer activity. A robust, reliable, and sensitive LC method was
developed for simultaneous analysis of wogonin and its major
metabolite, wogonoside, in tissues of tumor-bearing nude mice. To reach
the required level of detection in different tissues, sample
pretreatment was by solid-phase extraction. Good LC separation was
achieved on a C-18 column with methanol-0.5% formic acid 68:32 (v/v)
as mobile phase. UV detection was performed at 275 nm and calibration
plots for both analytes were linear over the range 0.16-80.0 mu g g(-1)
for all the biological samples studied with correlation coefficients >
0.9980. Inter-day and intra-day precision were no more than 15% at the
limit of quantification and 10% at other concentrations; recovery from
all tissues was 92.3-101.4% for wogonin and 66.7-74.3% for wogonoside.
The method was ideal for this tissue distribution study and results
obtained reflect the potential of wogonin for further pharmaceutical
development as an anticancer agent.

TI Immunization with a recombinant GnRH vaccine fused to heat shock
protein 65 inhibits mammary tumor growth in vivo
SO CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
AB Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the prime decapeptide
hormone in the regulation of mammalian reproduction. Active
immunization against GnRH has been a good treatment option to fight
against hormone-dependent disease such as breast cancer. We designed
and purified a novel protein vaccine Hsp65-GnRH(6) containing heat
shock protein 65 (Hsp65) and six copies of GnRH in linear alignment.
Immunization with Hsp65-GnRH(6) evoked strong humoral response in
female mice. The generation of specific anti-GnRH antibodies was
detected by ELISA and verified by western blot. In addition, anti-GnRH
antibodies effectively neutralized endogenous GnRH activity in vivo,
as demonstrated by the degeneration of the ovaries and uteri in the
vaccinated mice. Moreover, the growth of EMT-6 mammary tumor allografts
was inhibited by anti-GnRH antibodies. Histological examinations have
shown that there was increased focal necrosis in tumors. Taken
together, our results showed that immunization with Hsp65-GnRH(6)
elicited high titer of specific anti-GnRH antibodies and further led
to atrophy of reproductive organs. The specific antibodies could
inhibit the growth of EMT-6 murine mammary tumor probably via an
indirect mechanism that includes the depletion of estrogen. In view
of these results, the protein vaccine Hsp65-GnRH(6) appears to be a
promising candidate vaccine for hormone-dependent cancer therapy.

TI Synthesis, structure, DNA binding and cleavage ability of a new copper
ciprofloxacin complex
SO JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY
AB The structure of 1 consists of [Cu(HCp)(phen)(H2O)]2+ (HCp is
ciprofloxacin and phen is 1,10-phenanthroline), two acetates, and four
free water molecules. In each cation, copper displays a distorted
square pyramid, coordinated to ring 3-carboxylate and 4-oxo oxygen from
HCp, two nitrogens from phen, and one water molecule. There are five
water molecules in each discrete complex with one coordinated to Cu
center, and the other four linked to each other by intermolecular
hydrogen bonds. Two uncoordinated acetates make the compound neutral.
The complex exhibits higher DNA binding compared to HCp at the same
conditions by fluorescence and viscosity measurements. Combining its
structure with the DNA-binding result, the binding mechanism may be
explained by intercalation. Moreover, 1 shows significant cleavage of
DNA in the presence of a reducing agent, such as ascorbate by gel
electrophoresis using supercoiled pBR322 DNA in Tris-HCl buffer (pH
7.4). The complex also has a higher activity against Gram-positive
bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella

TI Differences in metabolite profile between blood plasma and serum
SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB In metabolomic research, blood plasma and serum have been considered
to possess similar compositions and properties. Their perceived
equivalence has resulted in researchers choosing arbitrarily between
serum and plasma for analysis. Here, routine serum and plasma were
prepared and their low-molecular-weight compounds were determined
using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Principal
components analysis was applied to process the acquired data, and
marked differences in metabolite profiles were observed between serum
and plasma. Of the 72 identified compounds, 36 (50%) discriminate serum
from plasma, with 29 and 7 metabolites showing a significantly higher
abundance (t test, P < 0.05) in serum and plasma, respectively.
Incubation of blood had distinct effects on the analyte peak areas,
with the effects being more pronounced for plasma than for serum and
more pronounced for a shorter incubation than for a longer incubation.
These results highlight the importance in choosing serum or plasma as
the analytical sample and in stipulating the incubation time. Because
incubation affected the analyte peak areas less in serum than in plasma,
we recommend serum as the sample of choice in metabolomic studies. (C)

TI Characterization of anticancer hypocrellin A encapsulated with silica
nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB Hypocrellins, natural photosensitizers including hypocrellin A (HA)
and hypocrellin B (HB), have been used as a traditional Chinese herbal
medicine to cure various skin diseases. Hypocrellins have excellent
antiviral activity, which can inhibit the growth of human
immunodeficiency virus. They also exhibit significant light-induced
antitumor property. In this article, thermal analysis technologies
(e.g., differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry) are
employed to characterize whether the photosensitive hypocrellin A
could be encapsulated with silica nanoparticle (SN) material or not,
and evaluate the stability of inclusion complex. The results show that
the inclusion complex exhibits improved performance in both stability
and hydrophilicity than natural hypocrellin A. Fluorescence
spectrophotometry studies have also been performed to verify the
thermal analysis results. The results suggest that the thermal analysis
technology could be used as an effective and rapid tool to characterize
the encapsulation properties of the novel anticancer HA-SN complex.

TI Tectoridin, an isoflavone glycoside from the flower of Pueraria lobata,
prevents acute ethanol-induced liver steatosis in mice
SO TOXICOLOGY
AB In traditional Chinese medicine, the flower of Pueraria lobata
(Puerariae Flos) has been used in therapy to counteract the problems
associated with alcohol drinking and liver injury. In this study, we
investigated the hepatoprotective effects and its mechanisms of
tectoridin, an isoflavone glycoside from the flower of P. lobata
(Willd.) Ohwi. Ethanol (5 g/kg) was given orally every 12 h for a total
of three doses. 1 h after the last dose of ethanol, tectoridin (25,
50 and 100 mg/kg) was given intragastrically five times in three
consecutive days. The mice were sacrificed at 4 h after tectoridin
treatment. Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor alpha (PPAR
alpha), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c and their
target genes were evaluated by biochemical analysis and quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Mitochondria were isolated
for the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and membrane
potential (Delta Psi(m)) assay. Acute ethanol exposure resulted in the
significant increase of the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) and triglyceride (TG) levels and hepatic
mitochondria dysfunction shown as the increase of MPT and the decrease
of Delta Psi(m). However, tectoridin treatment dramatically attenuated
these effects. In addition, tectoridin remarkably alleviated the
over-production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance.
Furthermore, tectoridin inhibited the decrease of PPAR alpha
expression and its target genes, including medium-chain acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase (MCAD), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and cytochrome P450 4A
(CYP 4A) at mRNA and enzyme activity levels. These data showed that
tectoridin protected against ethanol-induced liver steatosis mainly
through modulating the disturbance of PPAR alpha pathway and
ameliorating mitochondrial function. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Site-specific modification of anti-angiogenesis peptide HM-3 by
polyethylene glycol molecular weight of 20 kDa
SO JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY
AB HM-3, an RGD modified endostatin-derived polypeptide, is a potent
angiogenesis inhibitor synthesized in our laboratory. Its robust
inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tumour growth have
been demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro activity assays. However,
the drug has relatively short half-life in vivo. For the purpose of
prolonging HM-3 half-life and retaining the safety and efficacy of the
peptide, the study chose methoxy-polyethylene glycol-Succinimidyl
Carbonate (SC-mPEG, molecular weight 20 kDa, named SC-mPEG(20k)) to
specifically modify its N terminus. Compared with HM-3, the
site-specific mono-PEGylated peptide PEG(20k)-HM-3 was shown the same
activity in the inhibition of B16F10 tumour in vivo (the inhibitory
effect of PEG(20k)-HM-3, HM-3 and Taxol were 44.35, 39.68%,
respectively), while the frequency of drug-administering reduced from
twice a day to once every 3 days. Its rate of in vitro degradation in
serum was markedly reduced (72.78% could still be detected after 132
h). Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that both
HM-3 and PEG(20k)-HM-3 induced large areas of continuous necrosis
within tumours and significantly reduced the vessel density compared
to control. It might be a breakthrough in PEG modification field to
modify a small peptide with a large PEG and reach a good result.

TI pH-Sensitive mPEG-Hz-Cholesterol Conjugates as a Liposome Delivery
System
SO JOURNAL OF BIOACTIVE AND COMPATIBLE POLYMERS
AB Hydrazone (Hz)-based pH-sensitive methoxy(polyethylene glycol)cholesterol conjugates (mPEG-Hz-Chol), were synthesized and used to
fabricate liposomes. The structures of the mPEG2000-Hz-Chol conjugate
were confirmed by FT-IR and H-1-NMR; they were stable at pH 7.4 but
sensitive to mild acid conditions (pH 5.5). Plain liposomes were also
prepared with S100PC/Chol, and the pH-insensitive liposomes with
S100PC/Chol/mPEG2000-Chol for comparison; all the liposomes were
similar in diameter similar to 20 0 nm. In vitro, the pH-sensitive
liposomes released more of the model drug, paclitaxel (PTX), than the
plain liposomes. The pH-sensitive liposomes were less toxic than the
plain liposomes and exhibited higher cellular uptake of PTX compared
with pH-insensitive liposomes by human breast cancer cells (MCF-7).
The pH-sensitive mPEG2000-Hz-Chol liposomes are now being investigated
as a potential new liposome drug delivery system.

TI Study on the binding of chiral drug duloxetine hydrochloride to human
serum albumin
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Duloxetine holds a special promise as an antidepressant, and its effect
depends on its binding to human serum albumin (HSA). For this reason,
the binding mechanism of duloxetine with HSA was investigated. The
specific binding site in HSA was identified and binding constants were
determined. Duloxetine could compete with dansyl-L-proline (DLP), a
site II marker for binding to site II. Binding constants between
duloxetine and HSA were 1.75 x 10(3) L mol(-1) and 3.74 x 10(3) L mol(-1)
at pH 7.4 and pH 8.5, respectively. The interaction process of
enantiomers and HSA was susceptible to pH change. It was concluded that
specific binding position of duloxetine was located in site II, and
the B conformation of HSA possibly excelled the N conformation in
identifying and binding to enantiomers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

gambogic acid (II): Synthesis and bioevaluation of gambogellic acid
and its derivatives from gambogic acid as antitumor agents
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Gambogic acid (GA) has been reported to be a potent apoptosis inducer.
The fact that it is amenable to chemical modification makes GA an
attractive molecule for the development of anticancer agents. We
firstly reported the synthesis of gambogellic acid, which was generated
under acid catalysis from readily available GA by a base-catalyzed
diene intramolecular annelation. Sequentially, thirteen new compounds
were synthesized and their inhibitory activity on HT-29, Bel-7402,
BGC-823, and A549 cell lines were evaluated in vitro by MTT assay, and
(38, 40)-epoxy-33-chlorogambogellic acid (4) was identified as a
BGC-823 cell apoptosis inducer through MTT cell assay, observations
of morphological changes, and Annexin-V/PI double-staining assay.
Compound 4 showed significant effects in inducing apoptosis and might
serve as a potential lead compound for discovery of new anticancer
drugs. Further structure activity relationships (SARs) of gambogic
acid derivatives were discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

TI Synthesis and Anti-cancer Activity of Nitric Oxide Donor-based Matrine
Derivatives
SO CHEMICAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE UNIVERSITIES-CHINESE
AB Matrine, one of the major active alkaloids isolated from the Sophora
alopecuroides L which is a useful Chinese herbal drug, possesses
antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and notable antiviral
activities, and has been used for the treatment of
lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury. Recently, it was reported
that matrine could inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Nitric oxide(NO),
a free radical molecule, is involved in numerous physiological and
pathological processes. High levels of NO usually are toxic to tumor
cells. It was therefore of interest to determine whether the hybrid
of matrine and NO donor furoxan would provide a hitherto unknown class
of matrine derivatives that possess potent anticancer activity. Herein
furoxan-based matrine compounds 11a-11m were designed and synthesized,
and their structures were confirmed by MS, IR, H-1 NMR spectra and
elemental analysis. All target compounds exhibited expectedly much
more stronger anti human hepatocellular carcinoma cells(HepG2 cells)
activity than that of parent compound matrine in vivo. Furthermore,
compounds 11a-11c, 11h and 11i had stronger cytotoxic activities than
that of control 5-flu-orouracil. The concept of designing NO
donor-based matrine derivatives that possess potent anticancer
activity warrants further investigation.

TI The chemical and digestive properties of a soluble glucan from
Agrobacterium sp ZX09
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB A salt-tolerant strain Agrobacteriurn sp. ZX09 produced a high
molecular mass, water-soluble extracellular polysaccharide (EPS)
composed of D-glucose. By examining periodate oxidation, H-1 NMR and
C-13 NMR spectra, it was proven that the EPS consisted of the following
repeating unit: -> 3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 -> 3)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1 ->
3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 -> 3)]3-alpha-D-Glcp-(1 -> 3)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1 -> .
In vitro the EPS was indigestible by alpha-amylase, and strongly
inhibited pancreatic alpha-amylase activity. Fasting mice fed on the
EPS failed to increase blood glucose levels. Experimental diets
containing the EPS suppressed steep increase in blood glucose
concentration. These results suggest that the novel water-soluble
glucan could be potentially useful for decreasing absorption of dietary
carbohydrate and postprandial blood glucose level. (C) 2010 Elsevier

SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB A modified high-performance liquid chromatography method of pre-column
derivatization with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) has been
established for high resolution separation and high sensitivity
determination of ten monosaccharides simultaneously, which frequently
occur in algae polysaccharides. The effects of volume proportion of
acetonitrile and pH value of mobile phase (0.1 M phosphate buffer
acetonitrile) on retention and separation of the monosaccharide
derivatives were investigated with Eclipse XPB-C18 column screened
out. The hydrolyzation condition of polysaccharides and derivatization
procedure of hydrolysates were also optimized. The modified analysis
method was used for the determination of monosaccharide compositions
in five polysaccharide fractions isolated from Duanaliella salina. The
results showed that PD1 and PD4a were acidic heteropolysaccharide
mainly containing glucose and galactose respectively, and PD4a
contained sulfated groups; PD2 and PD3 all were a glucan; while PD4b
was a complex of polysaccharide linked with nucleic acids by covalent

SO ARZNEIMITTEL-FORSCHUNG-DRUG RESEARCH
AB A randomized, two-way, crossover, bio-equivalence study in 6 beagle
dogs was conducted to compare the bioavailability of two peppermint
oil formulations, soft capsule and hard capsule. The drug was given
in a single dose of two capsules (total, 200 mg), and blood samples
were withdrawn during the 12 h after drug administration. Menthol (CAS
2216-51-5) as the main component of peppermint oil was determined by
a gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method after
cleavage with beta-glocuronidase. The following pharmacokinetic
variables were computed for the two formulations: maximum
concentration (C-max), time to maximum concentration (T-max),
half-life of elimination (t(1/2)), mean residence time (MRT), and areas
under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-t), and
AUC(0-infinity)). For calculation of the 90% confidence interval (CI),
an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out.
The results indicated that treatment and subject had statistically
significant effect on AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity) and C-max, and the 90%
CIs for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity) and C-max were outside the acceptable
bioequivalence range. The relative bioavailability was 121.4 +/- 10.6%
for AUC(0-infinity) Therefore, it can be concluded that the two
formulations are not bioequivalent and the bioavailability of soft
capsules is significantly higher than that of hard capsules.

TI Establishment of a Novel Model for Studying the Effects of Extracts
of Chinese Herb Medicine on Human Type II 5 alpha-Reductase in Vitro
SO YAKUGAKU ZASSHI-JOURNAL OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Human steroid 5 alpha-reductase type II (hSRD5A2) and
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) play important roles in benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH). The aim of our study was to establish a novel model
to investigate the inhibitory effects of extracts and compounds of
Chinese herb medicine on hSRD5A2. The gene, hSRD5A2, was artificially
synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (+) vector, which was transfected
into CHO cells by liposome. Transfected cells were screened through
G418 and MTX. The expressed protein of hSRD5A2 by cells was purified
and detected by western blotting. A minim reactive system comprising
hSRD5A2 and testosterone (T) as substrate together with NADPH as
hydrogen donor was established for screening inhibitors of hSRD5A2.
The reaction system was optimized in the concentrations of T, NADPH,
and hSRD5A2 and reaction temperature, time, and activity of hSRD5A2
were determined by the production of DHT. Furthermore, we screened some
extracts and compounds of Chinese herb medicine using this model. The
concentrations of T, NADPH, and hSRD5A2 were 0.02 mu M, 0.8 mM, and
0.05 U/mu l, respectively, in the model; maximum activity of hSRD5A2
was achieved at 37 degrees C and 60 min reaction, and mangiferin had
significant inhibitory effect on the activity of hSRD5A2. The model
in this study is convenient and reliable for screening and evaluation
of inhibitors of hSRD5A2; mangiferin may be a potential medicine for
the treatment of BPH.

TI Synthesis and Bioactivity Evaluation of Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV
Resistant Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Analogues
SO PROTEIN AND PEPTIDE LETTERS
AB Glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone displaying
glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and trophic effects
on the pancreatic beta-cells. However, GLP-1 is rapidly degraded to
GLP-1(9-36) by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), which removes the
N-terminal dipeptide His(7)-Ala(8). The rapid inactivation of GLP-1
in the blood circulation limits its clinical application. Hence, we
replaced the enzymatic hydrolyzation position Ala(8) with other
natural amino acids. The GLP-1 analogues were synthesized rapidly and
efficiently under microwave irradiation, using Fmoc/tBu orthogonal
protection strategy. Studies on blood-glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1
analogues in vivo were undertaken using 10-week-old male Kunming mice.
The metabolic stability was tested by incubation with dipeptidyl
peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). Generally, Xaa(8)-GLP-1 analogues exhibit
resistance to DPP-IV degradation in vitro and stronger hypoglycemic
effect than GLP-1. This may help to understand the structure-activity
relationship of GLP-1 analogues.

TI Synthesis and evaluation of chitosan-graft-polyethylenimine as a gene
vector
SO PHARMAZIE
AB The objective of this study was to prepare a series of
chitosan-graft-polyethylenimine (chitosan-g-PEI) copolymers as gene
carriers with high transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity.
Chitosan-g-PEIs with different molecular weights and segments were
successfully synthesized by both oxidation and imine reactions and then
characterized by H-1 NMR, IR, UV and DSC. All types of Chitosan-g-PEIs
prepared were found to interact efficiently with plasmid DNA
(pIRES2-EGFP-p53) on DNA retardation assays. The Chitosan-g-PEI/DNA
complex had a diameter of approximately 200 nm and a surface potential
of zeta = +10.0 mV when the N/P ratio was 15/1. Optimal transfection
efficiency of the chitosan-g-PEI/DNA complex was observed at N/P = 45/1
on HepG2 cells, with significantly lower toxicity compared with the
gold standard PEI 25 kd. Moreover, the results showed that the toxicity
increased with increasing molecular weight of the PEI segment in
chitosan-g-PEI. Based on these results, chitosan-g-PEI with different
chitosan and PEI segments of could be used for gene expression on
different levels, and some of them may appear as potential candidates
for gene delivery systems.

TI Selective toxicity of antimicrobial peptide S-thanatin on bacteria
SO PEPTIDES
AB S-thanatin, an analog of thanatin, was synthesized by substituting the
15th amino acid of threonine with serine, which showed a broad
antimicrobial activity against bacteria. We reported earlier that
membrane phospholipid was found to be the target for S-thanatin with
different mechanism from other antimicrobial peptides. In this study,
we have performed its structural characterization by circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD analysis showed that S-thanatin
retained its overall conformation beta-sheet in aqueous buffer,
beta-turn in 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE) and beta-hairpin in 0.4 mM
POPC-LUVs. In hemolysis assay, S-thanatin exhibited low hemolytic
activity and bacteria selectivity. We investigated the effect of the
presence of 33 mol percent cholesterol on the interactions of the
antimicrobial peptide S-thanatin with phosphatidylcholine (PC) model
membrane systems. The results showed that S-thanatin was more potent
at disrupting cholesterol-free bacterial than cholesterol-containing
eukaryotic membranes. Thus, in all respects, fluorescence dye leakage
experiments indicated that cholesterol inhibited the
S-thanatin-induced permeabilization of PC vesicles. Finally, flow
cytometry was used to monitor changes in bacterial cell membrane
potential and cell membrane integrity, with specific fluorescent dyes
DiBAC(4)(3) and PI. Adding the respiratory poison CCCP seemed to
prevent peptide-induced membrane damage, which suggested that
S-thanatin acted at the metabolic level on respiratory chain. These
findings might explain why S-thanatin was selective toxicity towards
bacteria, but low toxicity towards erythrocytes. It might be due to
three factors at least: electrostatic interaction (namely anionic
phospholipids); cholesterol; respiratory chain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI Synthesis of N-Heteroaroyl Aminosaccharide Derivatives as Fibroblast
Growth Factor 2 Signaling Modulators
SO CHEMICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) signaling plays an important role
in angiogenesis. Heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) is required for FGF2
signaling but heparin mimics either promotes or inhibits FGF2
signaling. To take advantage such properties of heparin mimics, a
series of N-heteroaroyl aminosaccharide derivatives were designed and
synthesized as FGF2 signaling modulators. The bioactivity was
determined in a FGF2 and heparin-dependent cell proliferation assay
using FGFR1c expressing BaF3 cells. We found that most of the compounds
inhibited heparin- and FGF2-dependent BaF3 cell proliferation while
three compounds promoted the cell proliferation. These results suggest
that the small molecular heparin mimics approach might be useful in
developing novel anti-angiogenic agents.

TI Dishevelled-DEP domain interacting protein (DDIP) inhibits Wnt
signaling by promoting TCF4 degradation and disrupting the
TCF4/beta-catenin complex
SO CELLULAR SIGNALLING
AB The TCF4/beta-catenin complex, the executor of canonical
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, is regulated by a variety of factors. Among
these, Dishevelled (Dvl) is a critical regulator that releases
beta-catenin from degradation and stabilizes TCF4/beta-catenin
complex. Here, we report that DDIP (Dishevelled-DEP domain Interacting
Protein, also named as Spats1. spermatogenesis associated, serine-rich
1), a novel protein that interacts with Dvl, regulates Wnt signaling.
We provide evidence that DDIP suppresses Lef-1 luciferase reporter
activity stimulated by Wnt1. Dvl2 or beta-catenin, interacts with the
TCF4/beta-catenin complex, and disrupts the interaction of TCF4 and
beta-catenin by promoting TCF4 degradation through the proteasome
pathway. Our results indicate that DDIP is a negative regulator of the
canonical Wnt signaling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Development and validation of a robust LC-MS-MS with atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization for quantitation of carbazochrome sodium
sulfonate in human plasma: application to a pharmacokinetic study
SO BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB A highly selective and sensitive liquid chromatography coupled with
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-APCI-MS-MS) was developed and validated for the quantitation and
pharmacokinetic study of carbazochrome sodium sulfonate in human
plasma. Protein precipitation with 14% perchloric acid solution was
selected for sample preparation, and amiloride hydrochloride was
employed as an internal standard. The analytes were separated on a
Hypersil ODS-2 column by a multiple-step linear gradient elution with
a mobile phase consisting of 0.2% formic acid solution and methanol
pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The determination was optimized
and carried out with positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
by selective reaction monitoring of the ion of m/z 148, the protonated
thermodegraded fragment of the free acidic form of carbazochrome sodium
sulfonate selected as the parent, and the ion of m/z 107 as the optimum
collision induced dissociation (CID) product. The method was fully
validated over a concentration range of 0.5-50 ng/mL, with the lower
limit of quantitation of 0.5 ng/mL. The application of the LC-MS-MS
method was demonstrated for the specific and quantitative analysis of
carbazochrome sodium sulfonate in human plasma from a pharmacokinetic
study in 24 healthy male Chinese volunteers after a single oral
administration of 90 mg carbazochrome sodium sulfonate capsules.

TI SCLM, total saponins extracted from Chaihu-jia-longgu-muli-tang,
reduces chronic mild stress-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus in
mice
SO PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY
AB Increasing evidence demonstrates that stress or depression can lead
to atrophy and cell loss in the hippocampus. In contrast,
antidepressant treatment significantly reduces apoptosis in the
dentate granule cell layer and subgranular zone in animal models of
depression. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective
action of SCLM, the total saponins extracted from
Chaihu-jia-longgu-muli-tang, a traditional Chinese medicinal formula
which was prescribed 1000 years ago, in the reduction of apoptosis in
hippocampal neurons using an experimental chronic mild stress (CMS)
model. Mice were subjected to the CMS procedure for a period of 21
consecutive days. SCLM (100 mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, p.o.)
was administered during the stress periods. CMS mice showed a decreased
sucrose intake over 21 days, and an increase in the number of
TUNEL-positive neurons as well as up-regulation of the
apoptotic-related factors, such as Bax and caspase-3 in the
hippocampus, compared with control mice. On the other hand, the
administration of SCLM (100 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) reversed
these effects induced by CMS, showing a significant increase of sucrose
intake and a dramatic reduction of TUNEL-positive neurons and decreased
expression of Bax and caspase-3 proteins. The present results suggest
that SCLM possesses a significant antidepressant-like property, and
this effect may be through protection against stress-induced neuronal
apoptosis by affecting the expression of Bax and caspase-3 proteins
in the hippocampus. These findings provide important information that
the anti-apoptotic effect of herbal medicine therapy may be beneficial
for the treatment of depression.

TI Ruscogenin Mainly Inhibits Nuclear Factor-kappa B but Not Akt and
Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling Pathways in Human Umbilical
Vein Endothelial Cells
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Our previous results suggested that ruscognin inhibited tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced leukocyte adhesion, which correlated
with its suppression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
expression in endothelial cells. In the present studies, we further
examined its effects on the main signaling pathways involved in
upregulation of ICAM-1 induced by TNF-alpha in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results showed that ruscogenin
significantly suppressed p65 phosphorylation, I kappa B-alpha
phosphorylation and degration, and inhibited I kappa B kinase alpha
(IKK alpha) and IKK beta activation induced by TNF-alpha. However, it
exerted weak effects on TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylations of p38,
JNK, ERK1/2, and Akt. Overall, our results indicated that
downregulation of ICAM-1 expression by ruscogenin in HUVECs might be
mediated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), but not by
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt signaling pathways.

TI His-Oriented Peptide Hydrolysis Promoted by cis-[Pt(en)(H2O)(2)](2+):
a New Specific Peptide Cleavage Site
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB The new specific hydrolysis of histidine-containing peptides promoted
by cis-[Pt(en)(H2O)(2)](2+) was investigated by electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometry (NMR). MS determination demonstrated that
cis-[Pt(en)(H2O)(2)](2+) anchors to AcGHG with the stoichiometry of
either 1:1 or 2:1 (Pt/peptide), but only with 1:1 stoichoimetiy to
AcGHL. Cis-[Pt(en)(H2O)(2)](2+) is able to promote the cleavage of the
first downstream peptide bond from histidine at 60 degrees C and pH
2.65, and Pt-anchored peptides are the essential intermediates for the
promoted hydrolysis. Moreover, the larger amount of Pt(II) complex
results in higher fragmental yield and higher hydrolysis rate. In the
presence of 1 equiv of Pt(II) complex, H-1 NMR determination confirmed
the apparent first-order kinetics of the Pt(II)-promoted hydrolysis
and the hydrolysis rate for AcGHG and AcGHL is 0.20 day(-1) and 0.14
day(-1), respectively. Moreover, Pt(II) coordinating to histidine
imidazole is the key step to form the Pt(II)-anchored peptides. The
Pt(II)-activating the first His-downstream carbonyl group via synergic
coordinating to His imidazole and carbonyl O atom has been proposed
for the Pt(II)-promoted his-oriented peptide hydrolysis. The lower
rate for AcGHL should be correlated to the steric hindrance of Leu side
chain to the second Pt(II) coordinating to tripeptide. In addition,
the newly confirmed specific His-oriented peptide cleavage site
implies a new potential strategy for target cleavage of peptides or
proteins.

TI Peoniflorin Prevents the Adhesion Between Inflammatory Endothelial
Cells and Leukocytes Through Inhibiting the Activation of MAPKs and
NF-kappa B
SO DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB The vascular endothelium can be activated by multiple factors,
including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) functioning as a key component of
the inflammatory response. Activated endothelium promotes the
recruitment of leukocytes mainly by releasing various adhesion
molecules and amplifies inflammation via a feedback loop. Peoniflorin,
the main active constituent of the roots of Paeonia lactiora Pall.,
possesses anti-inammatory, anti-infective, and anti-platelet
aggregative properties. To elucidate the anti-inammatory mechanism of
peoniflorin, the present study was conducted to address its effects
on the adhesion of inflammatory endothelial cells to leukocytes.
Peoniflorin substantially reduced adhesion of either human acute
monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) or human acute promyelocytic leukemia
cells (HL-60) to LPS-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs). It also markedly down-regulated the expression of E-selectin
at both the gene and protein levels. However, peoniflorin only slightly
reduced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).
Signal pathway analysis indicated that peoniflorin reduced
phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase, as
well as the phosphorylation and degradation of I kappa B-alpha in
HUVECs. These findings suggest that prevention of the adhesion between
inflammatory endothelial cells and leukocytes contributes, at least
partially, to the anti-inflammation action of peoniflorin. The
anti-adhesion mechanisms of peoniflorin were involved in the
down-regulation of the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), and a reduction of
adhesion molecule expressions in endothelial cells. Drug Dev Res

TI Effects of a Novel Class III Antiarrhythmic Agent, CPUY11018, on Rat
Atrial Fibrillation
SO DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB CPUY11018 has anti-atrial fibrillation (AF) effects in rats. The
effects of CPUY11018 on the transient outward K+ current (I-to) and
ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K+ current (I-Kur) were studied using
whole-cell patch clamp techniques and an acetylcholine (ACh)-CaCl2
induced AF model. CPUY11018 inhibited I-to and I-kur in a
concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 18.5 and 1.7 mu M,
respectively. Inhibition was independent of the depolarizing voltage.
In the AF ACh-CaCl2 model, AF duration was effectively shortened after
treatment with 5 mg/kg CPUY11018 for 4 days. These results indicate
that CPUY11018 is effective in treating AF partly by blocking I-to and

TI PKSolver: An add-in program for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
data analysis in Microsoft Excel
SO COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
AB This study presents PKSolver, a freely available menu-driven add-in
program for Microsoft Excel written in Visual Basic for Applications
(VBA), for solving basic problems in pharmacokinetic (PK) and
pharmacodynamic (PD) data analysis. The program provides a range of
modules for PK and PD analysis including noncompartmental analysis
(NCA), compartmental analysis (CA), and pharmacodynamic modeling. Two
special built-in modules, multiple absorption sites (MAS) and
enterohepatic circulation (EHC), were developed for fitting the
double-peak concentration-time profile based on the classical
one-compartment model. In addition, twenty frequently used
pharmacokinetic functions were encoded as a macro and can be directly
accessed in an Excel spreadsheet. To evaluate the program, a detailed
comparison of modeling PK data using PKSolver and professional PK/PD
software package WinNonlin and Scientist was performed. The results
showed that the parameters estimated with PKSolver were satisfactory.
In conclusion, the PKSolver simplified the PK and PD data analysis
process and its output could be generated in Microsoft Word in the form
of an integrated report. The program provides pharmacokinetic
researchers with a fast and easy-to-use tool for routine and basic PK
and PD data analysis with a more user-friendly interface. (C) 2010

TI Enantiomeric Separation of Nefopam Hydrochloride by Affinity
Electrokinetic Chromatography Using Chondroitin Sulfate A as Chiral
Selector and Its Chiral Recognition Mechanism
SO CHROMATOGRAPHIA
AB In this study, a new approach to the enantioseparation of nefopam
hydrochloride by means of affinity electrokinetic chromatography
(AEKC) with chondroitin sulfate A belonging to linear ionic
polysaccharides has been developed. The difference in the
antinociceptive activity of the enantiomers of nefopam was
demonstrated in some studies, and the method established in this paper
allowed complete separation of nefopam. Especially, there are no
reports concerned with the enantioselective separation of nefopam
using chondroitin sulfate A as chiral selectors in CE. During the course
of this work, both migration time and enantioseparation of nefopam were
influenced by several parameters such as pH of the BGE, selector
concentration, capillary temperature and applied voltage.
Consequently, these parameters were systematically optimized in order
to obtain the optimum enantioseparation of nefopam. Moreover,
comparison of the influences of the studied parameters was further
investigated using univariate analysis of variance as a calculation
method by Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) in this
paper. Finally, a mechanism of enantiorecognition in AEKC towards the
enantiomers of nefopam with chondroitin sulfate A was described.

TI Bioscreening of phage display antibody library and expression of a
humanized single-chain variable fragment antibody against human
connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2)
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Excessive expression of CTGF (connective tissue growth factor)/CCN2
has been observed in many fibrotic diseases. The inhibition of the
CTGF/CCN2 by antibody has been shown to be clinically useful for the
management of fibrosis. A phage display humanized single-chain Fv
antibody library was screened using CTGF/C (CTGF/CCN2 C-terminal
domain) as the target. A phage ELISA was performed after four rounds
of biopanning, and ten positive clones were further evaluated by ELISA
and were chosen for DNA sequencing. The DNA encoding scFv (single-chain
variable fragment) containing a full-length variable domain fragment
of heavy chain and light chain of human immunoglobulin was inserted
into pET-32(a)+ vector, and the fusion protein (TrxA-scFv) containing
a thrombin cleavage site was expressed mainly in soluble form. The scFv
was obtained by purified fusion protein digested with thrombin and then
separated from the fusion partner TrxA by gel-filtration
chromatography. An immunological assay showed that the purified scFv
reacted with CTGF/CCN2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The result
of the cell migration assay demonstrated that the scFv at 100 ng/ml
could effectively inhibit the migration of HUVEC (human umbilical-vein
endothelial cells) caused by CTGF/C. The number of migratory cells was
significantly decreased as compared with the negative control (1062
+/- 92 versus 3269 +/- 288, P < 0.001) and the inhibition rate was 90.5%.

TI Intestinal absorption mechanisms of ginsenoside Rh2:
stereoselectivity and involvement of ABC transporters
SO XENOBIOTICA
AB 1. This study investigated the absorption mechanism of ginsenoside Rh2
to clarify the reasons for its poor absorption. Transepithelial
transport across Caco-2 cell monolayers, cellular uptake, and in situ
rat intestinal perfusion were examined.
2. Cellular uptake of Rh2 was linear from 1 to 50 mu M at 4 degrees
C, whereas it was saturated when the concentration exceeded 10 mu M
at 37 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, the uptake at 10 mu M was linear in
60 min. Intracellular exposure in 240 min was 2173.70 and 979.38 ng .
min/mu g for S and R isomers, respectively.
3. Transepithelial permeability of Rh2 was about 10(-8) to 10(-7) cm/s.
Efflux ratios were above 1.5. Sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium citrate,
and sodium deoxycholate had no effect on Rh2 permeability.
4. After intestinal perfusion for 3 h, 9.1% of 20(R)- Rh2 and 15.7%
of 20(S)- Rh2 were absorbed.
5. Cyclosporine, quercetin, and probenecid could improve the cellular
uptake, absorptive permeability, and intestinal absorption.
Carrier-mediated transport was the major absorption mechanism. Rh2 was
a substrate of ABC transporters.
6. The ABC-transporter-mediated efflux and the poor permeability were
the major reasons for Rh2 poor absorption. 7. The stereoselective
absorption was significant. R isomer exhibited lower absorption
profiles in all the experiments, possibly due to more potent efflux.

TI Wogonin potentiates the antitumor effects of low dose 5-fluorouracil
against gastric cancer through induction of apoptosis by
down-regulation of NF-kappaB and regulation of its metabolism
SO TOXICOLOGY LETTERS
AB Traditional Chinese medicines have been recognized as a new source of
anticancer drugs or chemotherapy adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of
chemotherapy and to ameliorate the side effects. Wogonin (WOG) has a
potential for therapeutic use in the treatment of antitumor and
chemoprophylaxis 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a key systemic chemotherapy
drug and widely use in the treatment of solid tumors In this study,
we found that combination of WOG and 5-FU inhibited the viability of
MGC-803 cells in a concentration-dependent manner and exhibited a
synergistic anticancer effect (Cl < 1) when 5-FU was used at relatively
low concentrations. The pro-apoptotic activity of two-drug combination
was much stronger than single. Furthermore, WOG could decrease the mRNA
levels of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the metabolic enzymes
of 5-FU WOG could inhibit the NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and
I-kappa B phosphorylation. Moreover, combined treatment caused
significantly growth inhibition of human tumor xenografts. in
addition, WOG markedly enhanced the antitumor activity of low dose 5-FU
(i p 10 mg/kg/day), however there is no toxicity and influence on diet
consumption in experimental animals. Taken together, our data's showed
that WOG increased 5-FU retention for a prolonged catabolism by
modulating 5-FU metabolic enzymes and sensitized the MGC-803 cells to
5-FU induced apoptosis by inhibiting the NF-kappa B nuclear
translocation. The anti-gastric cancer effect of two-drug combination
was much stronger than that of WOG or 5-FU alone. These results may
be relevant to design new clinical therapeutic strategies against
gastric cancer in future (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights

TI Breviscapine-induced Apoptosis of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell
Line HepG2 was Involved in its Antitumor Activity
SO PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB Breviscapine is a flavonoid constituent isolated from a traditional
Chinese herb Erigerin breviscapus (Vant.) Hand-Mazz. To investigate
the apoptosis-inducing effect of breviscapine on human hepatocellular
carcinoma cell line HepG2 and explore the relative molecular
mechanisms. HepG2 cells were treated with breviscapine at different
concentrations and the inhibitory rate was analyzed by MTT assay. The
morphological changes in cells were observed under an inverted light
microscope and a fluorescence microscope and the apoptosis rate were
detected by flow cytometry. Western blot was used to evaluate the
protein expression. The viability of HepG2 cells was markedly inhibited
in a concentration-dependent manner and obvious morphological changes
were confirmed, including condensed chromatin and reduction in volume.
The increased percentage of apoptotic cells was displayed by flow
cytometry and the altered expression level of several
apoptosis-associated proteins, Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3, was detected
by western blot. It is first discovered that breviscapine exhibited
potential antitumor activity, induces remarkable apoptosis in HepG2
cells and promises to be a new candidate in future cancer therapy.

TI Self-assembled liquid crystalline nanoparticles as a novel ophthalmic
delivery system for dexamethasone: Improving preocular retention and
ocular bioavailability
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
AB The object of this study was to design novel self-assembled liquid
crystalline nanoparticles (cubosomes) as an ophthalmic delivery system
for dexamethasone (DEX) to improve its preocular retention and ocular
bioavailability DEX cubosome particles were produced by fragmenting
a cubic crystalline phase of monoolein and water in the presence of
stabilizer Poloxamer 407. Small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXR)
profiles revealed its internal structure as Pn3m space group,
indicating the diamond cubic phase. In vitro, the apparent permeability
coefficient of DEX administered in cubosomes exhibited a 4.5-fold (F1)
and 3 5-fold (F2) increase compared to that of Dex-Na phosphate eye
drops Preocular retention studies revealed that the retention of
cubosomes was significantly longer than that of solution and carbopol
gel, with AUC(0 -> 180min) of Rh B cubosomes being 2-3-fold higher than
that of the other two formulations In vivo pharmacokinetics in aqueous
humor was evaluated by microdialysis, which indicated a 1 8-fold (F1)
increase in AUC(0 -> 240min) of DEX administered in cubosomes relative
to that of Dex-Na phosphate eye drops, with about an 8-fold increase
compared to that of DEX suspension Corneal cross-sections after
incubation with DEX cubosomes demonstrated an unaffected corneal
structure and tissue integrity, which indicated the good
biocompatibility of DEX cubosomes In conclusion, self-assembled liquid
crystalline nanoparticles might represent a promising vehicle for
effective ocular drug delivery Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

TI Structure-Based Virtual Screening and Electrophysiological Evaluation
of New Chemotypes of K(V)1.5 Channel Blockers
SO CHEMMEDCHEM
AB Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent nonfatal cardiac rhythm
disorder associated with an increased risk of heart failure and stroke.
Considering the ventricular side effects induced by anti-arrhythmic
agents in current use, K(v)1.5 channel blockers have attracted a great
deal of deliberation owing to their selective actions on atrial
electrophysiology. Herein we report new chemotypes of K(v)1.5 channel
blockers that were identified through a combination of structure-based
virtual screening and in silico druglike property prediction including
six scoring functions, as well as electrophysiological evaluation.
Among them, five of the 18 compounds exhibited >50% blockade ratio at
10 mu m, and have structural features different from conventional
K(v)1.5 channel blockers. These novel scaffolds could serve as hits
for further optimization and SAR studies for the discovery of selective
agents to treat AF.

TI Gambogic acid triggers DNA damage signaling that induces
p53/p21(Waf1/CIP1) activation through the ATR-Chk1 pathway
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB Gambogic acid (GA) has been wildly studied to show potent anti-tumor
effects in vivo and in vitro. We have confirmed that GA stabilized and
activated p53 through down-regulating the expression of MDM2 in variety
of cancer cell lines. However, GA-induced p53 activation could be
partially reversed by caffeine, a PI3k inhibitor. Therefore, questions
of whether GA induces post-translational modifications of p53 and
subsequent activation of p53; and if that is the case, which upstream
signaling pathway(s) is (are) responsible for that are proposed. Here,
the relationship between p53 activation and its post-translational
modifications was investigated in the human cancer cell lines HepG2
and A549 in response to GA or adriamycin treatment. GA induces p53
phosphorylation at sites Ser15 and Ser20 in a concentration- or
time-dependent way, which was a direct result of DNA damage, as
gamma-HA2X foci and 'comet' DNA fragments were detected. GA induces
p53 phosphorylation through activation of an ATM- and Rad3-related
pathway, and GA-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 is also involved. Upon
treatment with GA, AIR activation is clearly associated with p53
phosphorylation, as well as activation of its target gene
p21(Waf/CIP1). Furthermore, we found the dephosphorylation of Cdk1 at
Thr161 induced by GA was abrogated, followed by a remarkable disruption
of G2/M arrest when the cells were pre-incubated with caffeine.
Interestingly, the sensitivity to caffeine enhanced the cytotoxicity
of GA as well. Taken together, these data showed an important role of
the DNA damage response mediated by ATR-Chk1 in p53/p21(Waf/CIP1)
activation and downstream G2/M arrest during GA treatment. (C) 2010

TI Reactive oxygen species-mitochondria pathway involved in
LYG-202-induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG(2)
cells
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB Previously, we demonstrated that LYG-202, a newly synthesized
flavonoid with a piperazine substitution, exhibited obvious antitumor
activity in vivo and in vitro. The exact mechanism of this new compound
remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of
LYG-202 on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the downstream
signaling pathway in the apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma
HepG2 cells. Pretreatment with NAC (N-acetylcysteine), a ROS
production inhibitor, partly inhibited the apoptosis induced by
LYG-202 via blocking the ROS generation. Further data revealed that
LYG-202 induced ROS accumulation followed by a decrease in
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c (Cyt
c) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to cytosol, which induced
apoptosis of the cells. Moreover, the mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPK), the downstream effect of ROS accumulation including
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, could be activated by
LYG-202. Taken together, the generation of ROS might play an important
role in LYG-202-induced mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which
provided further support for LYG-202 as a novel anticancer therapeutic
candidate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Apoptosis induction of ZBB-006, a novel synthetic diterpenoid, in the
human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 in vitro and in vivo
SO CANCER BIOLOGY & THERAPY
AB Diterpenes, present in many medicinal plants, have been the focus of
continuous studies for the development of new anticancer agents.
ZBB-006 is a new synthetic diterpenoid derivative which exhibited
significant anti-proliferation activity against various cancer cell
lines in our previous study. Here, we investigated the antitumor effect
of ZBB-006 and its potential mechanisms in the human hepatocellular
carcinoma cell line HepG2, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that
oral administration of ZBB-006 effectively suppressed the growth of
HepG2 xenograft tumor in nude mice without body weight decline,
compared with the control group. Meanwhile, the growth inhibitory
effect of ZBB-006 on HepG2 cells was observed with MTT assay. Then
apoptosis induced by ZBB-006 in HepG2 cells was evidenced by DAPAPI
staining and Annexin V/PI double staining assay. ZBB-006 also
dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m)
apparently as revealed by JC-1 staining. Furthermore, the cleavage of
PAPARP, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 but not caspase-8 was
demonstrated by western blot assay both in vitro and in vivo.
Additionally, the proapoptotic protein Bax was markedly elevated,
while the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was downregulated. Collectively,
our data indicated that ZBB-006 exerted a strong antitumor effect on
HepG2 cells by initiating the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, and
it has potential to be explored as a new promising therapeutic agent
against human hepatoma.

SO VACCINE
AB GnRH is a promising target in hormone-dependent cancer immunotherapy.
In our previous study, we have designed and purified a peptide vaccine
GhM (GnRH3-hinge-MVP) by use of the bioprocess system based on
asparaginase. Active immunization with GhM in the presence of CFA/IFA
evoked strong humoral response. In this study, the motif NRLLLTG with
high affinity to nanoparticle carrier VLP HBc Delta-SBD was fused to
the C terminus of GhM to form a new peptide vaccine GhMNR
(GnRH3-hinge-MVP-NRLLLTG). The fusion protein ansB-C-GhMNR was
controlled by vigorous T7lac promotor and expressed effectively as
inclusion bodies after induction by lactose and then purified by means
of cell disruption, washing and cold ethanol fractionation. After
hydrolyzed for 72 h, GhMNR was liberated from the fusion partner ansB-C
and purified by CM52 cation exchange chromatography. These results
suggested that the bioprocess system is suitable for large-scale
expression and purification of the peptide vaccine GhMNR, and even some
other proteins or peptides which may be important for industrial or

TI Inhibitory effect on protein kinase C theta by Crocetin attenuates
palmitate-induced insulin insensitivity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Epidemiologic and experimental studies have pointed to an etiologic
role of elevated plasma free fatty acids in insulin resistance, which
is frequently associated with a state of low-grade inflammation. In
this study, we investigated the effects of Crocetin, a unique
carotenoid, on insulin resistance induced by palmitate in 3T3-L1
adipocytes. Exposure of palmitate led to an increase in insulin
receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) serine(307) phosphorylation as well as
activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and inhibitor kappa B
kinase 3 (IKK beta), concomitantly with reductions of IRS-1 function
and glucose metabolism. Interestingly, pretreatment with Crocetin
almost reversed all of these abnormalities in a dose-dependent manner.
IRS-1 serine(307) phosphorylation was significantly reduced by JNK or
IKK beta inhibitor, especially by combination of these two inhibitors.
Moreover, palmitate treatment induced activation of protein kinase C
theta (PKC theta) while blocking PKC theta significantly inhibited JNK
and IKK beta activation induced by palmitate or phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PKC activator, PMA), and attenuated the palmitate-induced
defects in insulin action. Crocetin demonstrated an impressive
suppression in the activation of PKC theta induced not only by palmitate
but also by PMA in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, Crocetin
inhibited JNK and IKK beta activation via suppression of PKC theta
phosphorylation, attenuating insulin insensitivity induced by
palmitate in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Production and purification of an analog of glucagon-like peptide-1
by auto-induction and on-column cleavage in Escherichia coli
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB As a promising type 2 anti-diabetic agent, glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) is attracting more and more interest. Mutated GLP-1 (mGLP-1)
is an analog of native GLP-1. To facilitate the production and
purification of mGLP-1, auto-induction and on-column cleavage was
employed in this study. By using auto-induction system, after 24 h of
shaking culture, about 12.6 g wet bacterial cells could be obtained
from 1 l medium, and this was about 3.6 times more than that of the
IPTG-induction group. After disruption and centrifugation, the fusion
protein was directly purified and cleaved on Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow
column. Then, RESOURCE15 RPC column was used for further purification.
By using these two steps of purification, about 1.58 mg of mGLP-1 with
the purity of up to 98% could be obtained from 1 g wet bacterial cells.
In the bioactivity study, mGLP-1 displayed a significant and
dose-dependent glucose-lowering activity. These results suggested
that auto-induction and on-column cleavage could facilitate the
production and purification of mGLP-1. These methods could also be
applied to the preparation of other proteins and peptides.

TI Therapeutic effect of norisoboldine, an alkaloid isolated from Radix
Linderae, on collagen-induced arthritis in mice
SO PHYTOMEDICINE
AB The alkaloid fraction of Radix Linderae, the main active component of
this herb drug, has been proven to exhibit anti-inflammatory,
analgestic and antimicrobial activities. The present study was
undertaken to investigate the therapeutic potential of norisoboldine,
the major isoquinoline alkaloid present in Radix Linderae, in collagen
II -induced arthritis (CIA) of mice as well as the possible mechanisms.
CIA was induced in mice by immunization with chicken type II collagen
(II). After boosted on day 21, mice were treated with norisoboldine
(10, 20, 40 mg/kg) for twenty consecutive days. The clinical scores,
body weight changes and joint histopathology were evaluated.
Norisoboldine treatment significantly alleviated the severity of the
disease, based on the reduced clinical scores and elevated the lowered
body weights of model mice. Meanwhile, this alkaloid dose-dependently
reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells, synovial hyperplasia
and protected joint from destruction. Additionally, the serum level
of anti-CII IgG and the CII-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation were
remarkably decreased in the groups administered with norisoboldine.
An assessment of Th1 function using the delayed-type hypersensitivity
model confirmed that norisoboldine also significantly suppressed the
enhanced T cell responses in vivo. These findings suggest that
norisoboldine might be a potential therapeutic agent for rheumatoid
arthritis, and it functions through protecting joint destruction as
well as regulating the abnormal immune responses. (C) 2010 Elsevier

TI Potential antidepressant properties of Radix Polygalae (Yuan Zhi)
SO PHYTOMEDICINE
AB Radix Polygalae ("Yuan Zhi", the roots of Polygala tenuifolia Willd.,
YZ) is an important herb used in traditional Chinese medicine to mediate
depression. The present study was designed to verify the antidepressant
effects of the standardized YZ ethanol extract (YZE) and its four
fractions YZ-30, YZ-50, YZ-70 and YZ-90 on the tail suspension (TST)
and forced swimming test (FST). Furthermore, the standardization of
the fractions obtained from the separation procedures was carried out
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fingerprint. The
YZ-50 fraction (Oligosaccharide esters - enriched, oral (200 mg/kg)
showed a significant anti-immobility like effects. The data of YZ-50
on the corticosterone-induced injure of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma
cell indicated that YZ-50 may have biological effects on
neuroprotection. Proliferation of cell lines was assessed by
dimethylthiazoldiphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) and
5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays. It was found that
YZ-50 and its two bioactive compounds, 3,6'-di-o-sinapoyl-sucrose
(DISS) and tenuifoliside A(TEA) showed protection activities in SY5Y
cells from the lesion. By using bioassay-screening methods, our results
indicate that the presence of oligosaccharide esters such as DISS and
TEA in this herb may be responsible for the cytoprotective activity
effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI In silico binding characteristics between human histamine H-1 receptor
and antagonists
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING
AB It is widely acknowledged that the H-1 receptor antagonists have
important therapeutic significance in the treatment of various
allergic disorders, but little was known about the binding mode between
the receptor and antagonists since the crystal structure of G-protein
coupling receptors (GPCRs) were hard to obtain. In this paper, a
theoretical three-dimensional model of human histamine H-1 receptor
(HHR1) was developed on the basis of recently reported high resolution
structures of human A(2A) adenosine receptor, human
beta(2)-adrenoceptor and turkey beta(1)-adrenoceptor. Furthermore,
three representative H-1 receptor antagonists were chosen for docking
studies. Subsequently, a qualitative pharmacophore model was developed
by Hiphop algorithm based on the docking conformations of these three
antagonists. In this paper, active environment, certain key residues,
and the corresponding pharmacophore features of H-1 receptor were
identified by such combinations of receptor-based and ligand-based
approaches, which would give sufficient guidance for the rational
design of novel antihistamine agents.

TI Investigation on the morphological protective effect of
5-hydroxymethylfurfural extracted from wine-processed Fructus corni
on human L02 hepatocytes
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Aim: To determine the mode of action of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF)
extracted from wine-processed Fructus corni on hepatoprotective
activities, the effects of 5-HMF on H2O2-induced human L02 hepatocytes
injury was examined.
Mthods: Hepatocytes L02 injured by H2O2 was treated by 5-HMF. The
morphological changes of the cells were observed under inverted
phase-contrast, fluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy
and the activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were tested by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent detector.
Results: It revealed that 5-HMF improved the morphology of H2O2-treated
human L02 hepatocytes, and also inhibited the level of caspase-9 and
caspase-3 of them.
Conclusions: These results suggested a morphological hepatocyte
protective effect and the anti-apoptosis mechanism by 5-HMF. (C) 2010

TI A validated stability-indicating HPLC method for the determination of
PEGylated puerarin in aqueous solutions
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB The aim of this study was to develop a validated specific
stability-indicating HPLC method for the quantitative determination
of PEGylated puerarin (PEG-PUE) in aqueous solutions. The method was
validated by subjecting PEG-PUE to forced degradation under stress
conditions of acid, alkali, water hydrolysis, and oxidation. Both
PEG-PUE and puerarin (PUE) were simultaneously determined and
separated on CAPCELL PAK C18 column by gradient elution with 0.2%
aqueous phosphoric acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. The flow
rate was 1.0 mL min(-1) and detection wavelength was set at 250 nm.
Both calibration curves showed good linear regression (r >= 0.9998)
within test ranges. The LOD and LOQ of PEG-PUE were determined to be
3 and 9 mu g mL(-1) respectively. Degradation of PEG-PUE followed
pseudo-first-order kinetics with t(1/2) of 59 min at pH 9.0 and 17.79
h at pH 7.4. However, at pH 5.0 and 2.0, there was no significant
degradation of PEG-PUE over time. In conclusion, the method was
observed to have the necessary specificity, precision, and accuracy,
and to be suitable for quantity monitoring the degradation process of
PEG-PUE during stability studies. The degradation studies may give
insight into useful information for formulation development of
PEG-PUE. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

and its application to pharmacokinetic study
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB We have developed and validated a sensitive liquid
chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric
(LC-ESI-MS) method for the quantification of verticinone, a major
active constituent from Fritillaria hupehensis Hsiao et KC Hsia., in
rat plasma. Verticinone and the internal standard (IS), hupehenine,
were extracted from plasma samples by a simple liquid-liquid extraction
with ethyl acetate after being alkalified by 1 M ammonia hydroxide.
Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C-18 column using a
gradient elution program with methanol and water as the mobile phase.
The detection was performed by selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode via
positive electrospray ionization (ESI) interface. The lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) was 0.1 ng/mL. The calibration curves were linear
(r(2) > 0.998) over the concentration range of 0.1-200 ng/mL. Withinand between-run precision was less than 6.5% and accuracy was within
+/- 10.7%. The validated method was applied to the pharmacokinetic
study of verticinone in rats after a single oral administration of 1
mg/kg. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Upregulated NADPH Oxidase Contributes to Diabetic Testicular
Complication and is Relieved by Strontium Fructose 1,6-Diphosphate
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & DIABETES
AB Diabetes is frequently associated with declining sexual function
resulting from oxidative damage. NADPH oxidase is a major resource of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the testes and is likely related to
an activated endothelin-1 (ET-1) system. An activation of NADPH oxidase
- ET-1 pathway was hypothesized in diabetic testopathy. We verified
the hypothesis and tested if strontium fructose 1,6-diphosphate
(FDP-Sr) could relieve these changes in diabetic testis as compared
to testosterone propionate (TP) and sildenafil. Diabetes was produced
in male Sprague-Dawley rats 8 weeks after a single injection of
streptozotocin (STZ), and interventions with testosterone propionate
(TP), sildenafil and FDP-Sr were conducted in the last 4 weeks. Blood
glucose, testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),
luteinizing hormone (LH) and expressions of NADPH oxidase subunits and
the ET system were measured. Decreased insulin, FSH, LH and
testosterone in serum were found associating with testicular oxidative
stress in STZ-injected rats. Additionally, over-expressions of NADPH
oxidase p22, p47, p67 subunits and the ET pathway were significant in
the diabetic testis relative to normal and were completely abolished
by FDP-Sr. Both TP and sildenafil were not beneficial to diabetic
testopathy except serum androgen raised by TP. Activated NADPH oxidase
and ET system are significant contributing to testis injury and are
responded to FDP-Sr only, against both TP and sildenafil, by restoring
the testis function and the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis. It is
due to its extra-energy supply and an antioxidant activity of FDP-Sr.

TI Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Between Quantumn Dots
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The fluorescent resonance energy transfer(FRET) between two kinds of
quantum dots(QDs) with different surface-charge was researched.
Green-emission QDs was modified with amphiphilic surfactants (CTMAB)
and red-emission QDs was modified with thiolglycolic acid (TGA)
separately. The experiments proved that both CTMAB and TGA both could
well turn the oil-soluble QDs into water-soluble ones, as well as
opposite electric charges on the surface. Then the water-soluble QDs
were characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis, fluorescence image
and quantum yield. Taking advantage of the interaction between the
opposite charges, fluorescent resonance energy transfer(FRET) was
detected between two kinds of QDs in phosphate buffer solution(pH 7.5)
with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm, and the FRET efficiencies were
satisfied (quenching efficiency was 0.54 and enhance efficiency was
0.27).

TI Novel pH-sensitive chitosan-derived micelles loaded with paclitaxel
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB A series of pH-sensitive graft copolymers,
N-octyl-N-(2-carboxyl-cyclohexamethenyl) chitosan derivatives were
synthesized and characterized by FTIR, H-1 NMR and elemental analysis,
and their physical properties were measured with differential scanning
calorimetry and X-ray diffraction spectrometry. The critical micelle
concentrations (CMCs) of the modified chitosan determined by using
pyrene as a hydrophobic probe in fluorescence spectroscopy were from
11 to 72 mu g/ml. The graft polymers can form micelles solubilizing
paclitaxel, with drug-loading rate ranging from 30.47% to 48.10% and
entrapment efficiency from 42.22% to 59.24%. Cytotoxicities of carrier
against tumor cells estimated that carriers were nearly non-cytotoxic.
Additionally, the results of pH-sensitivity and drug release
experiments showed that the micelles were highly sensitive to mild
acidic conditions (pH 5.5) while reasonably stable at physiological
conditions (pH 7.4). Therefore, chitosan-derived micelle may be a
potential anti-tumor drug delivery system for chemotherapy of cancer.

TI Fragmentation study of iridoid glycosides and phenylpropanoid
glycosides in Radix Scrophulariae by rapid resolution liquid
chromatography with diode-array detection and electrospray ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry
SO BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB Rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC) coupled with diode array
detection (DAD) and electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (ESI-TOF MS) method was applied to the mass spectral study
of a series of naturally occurring iridoid glycosides and
phenylpropanoid glycosides in Radix Scrophulariae, which provides
higher speed and increased sensitivity without loss of resolution. With
dynamic adjustment as the key role of the fragmentor voltage and
confirmed with authentic standards, valuable structural information
regarding the nature of both the glycoside skeletons was thus obtained.
Most compositions were found to possess organic acid moiety such as
cinnamoyl, caffeoyl and ferulyol. Besides extensive fragmentation of
the carbohydrate moiety, losses of the hydroxyl and glucose residue
units showed in the spectra, permitting the exploration of the skeleton
and the identity of substituents in the molecule. Ten major iridoid
glycosides and 10 phenylpropanoid glycosides were identified or
tentatively characterized based on their retention times, UV and TOF
MS data. The major fragmentation pathways of PGs in Radix Scrophulariae
obtained through the MS data was schemed systematically for the first
time, which provides a reference for other PGs derivatives. Copyright

TI Differential regulations of blood pressure and perturbed metabolism
by total ginsenosides and conventional antihypertensive agents in
spontaneously hypertensive rats
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To investigate the regulatory effects of total ginsenosides and
the conventional antihypertensive agents (captopril, amlodipine,
terazosin and hydrochlorothiazide) on the blood pressure and perturbed
metabolism in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and to analyze
the cause-effect relationships between high blood pressure and the
metabolic disorders of hypertension.
Methods: SHRs were administrated with total ginsenosides or the
antihypertensive agents for eight weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SP)
was measured every week and low-molecular-weight compounds in blood
plasma were quantitatively analyzed using a nontargeted
high-throughput metabolomic tool: gas chromatography/time of flight
mass spectrometry (GC/TOFMS). The metabolic patterns were evaluated
using principal components analysis and potential markers of
hypertension were identified.
Results: Total ginsenosides and the antihypertensive agents
differentially regulated SP and the metabolic pattern in SHRs. Total
ginsenosides caused a progressive and prolonged reduction of SP and
markedly normalized the perturbed metabolism with 14 of 27 (51.8%)
markers of hypertension which were regulated toward normal. Total
ginsenosides also reduced free fatty acids' level toward normal levels.
In contrast, captopril, amlodipine and terazosin efficiently depressed
SP, but had little effect on metabolic perturbation with only 8 (29.6%),
4 (14.8%), and 4 (14.8%) markers, respectively, which were regulated.
Conclusion: The metabolic changes persisted when the blood pressure
was lowered by the conventional antihypertensive agents, suggesting
that hypertension may not be the cause of the metabolic perturbation
in SHRs.

SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To generate a polyclonal antibody against sarsasapogenin and to
develop an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(IC-ELISA) method for the pharmacokinetic study of Sarsasapogenin in
rats.
Methods: The antigen of sarsasapogenin was produced using an active
ester method and subsequently used for raising polyclonal antibodies
in rabbits. The specificity and sensitivity of the antibody were
measured by IC-ELISA. Using the ELISA method, sarsasapogenin levels
were measured in the serum of rats after an oral dose of 100 mg/kg.
Results: Polyclonal antibodies raised against sarsasapogenin-bovine
serum albumin were generated and showed a high reactivity to
sarsasapogenin. The antibodies exhibited minor cross-reactivity to
ruscogenin (23%), diosgenin (22%), 25 (R, S) ruscogenin
I-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->2)][beta-D-xylopyranosyl
(1-->3)]-beta-D-fucopyranoside (26%) and no cross-reactivity to
diammonium glycyrrhizinate and notoginseng R1. The detection range of
sarsasapogenin by this ELISA method was approximately 2.4-760 ng/mL.
The recovery rates of 10 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, and 500 ng/mL were in the
range of 91.0%-96.2% for intra-assay and 89.0%-92.0% for inter-assay.
The coefficients of variation (CV%) for intra-and inter-assays at the
three different sarsasapogenin levels were 3.1%-8.3% (n=6) and
6.0%-14.1% (n=6), respectively.
Conclusion: The IC-ELISA method is a sensitive test for the
determination of sarsasapogenin concentration in rat plasma and for
pharmacokinetic (PK) studies.

TI Novel vehicle based on cubosomes for ophthalmic delivery of
flurbiprofen with low irritancy and high bioavailability
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To develop a novel vehicle based on cubosomes as an ophthalmic
drug delivery system for flurbiprofen (FB) to reduce ocular irritancy
and improve bioavailability.
Methods: FB-loaded cubosomes were prepared using hot and high-pressure
homogenization. Cubosomes were then characterized by particle size,
zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, particle morphology, inner
cubic structure and in vitro release. Corneal permeation was evaluated
using modified Franz-type cells. Ocular irritation was then evaluated
using both the Draize method and histological examination. The ocular
pharmacokinetics of FB was determined using microdialysis.
Results: The particle size of each cubosome formulation was about 150
nm. A bicontinuous cubic phase of cubic P-type was determined using
cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) observation and
small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis. In vitro corneal
permeation study revealed that FB formulated in cubosomes exhibited
2.5-fold (F1) and 2.0-fold (F2) increase in P-app compared with FB PBS.
In the ocular irritation test, irritation scores for each group were
less than 2, indicating that all formulations exhibited excellent
ocular tolerance. Histological examination revealed that neither the
structure nor the integrity of the cornea was visibly affected after
incubation with FB cubosomes. The AUC of FB administered as FB cubosome
F2 was 486.36+/-38.93 ng.mL(-1).min.mu g(-1), which was significantly
higher than that of FB Na eye drops (P<0.01). Compared with FB Na eye
drops, the T-max of FB cubosome F2 was about 1.6-fold higher and the
MRT was also significantly longer (P<0.001).
Conclusion: This novel low-irritant vehicle based on cubosomes might
be a promising system for effective ocular drug delivery.

TI New features on the fragmentation patterns of homoisoflavonoids in
Ophiopogon japonicus by high-performance liquid
chromatography/diode-array detection/electrospray ionization with
multi-stage tandem mass spectrometry
SO RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB Homoisoflavonoids, a special class of flavonoids, are mainly
distributed in the Liliaceae family and have various biological
activities. Previously, very little research has been reported on the
gas-phase fragmentation patterns of homoisoflavonoids by electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry. In this paper, we report the use of
high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode-array detector
(HPLC-DAD) and electrospray ionization multi-stage tandem mass
spectrometry (ESI-MSn) to study the fragmentation behavior of 11
homoisoflavonoid standards and to analyze homoisoflavonoids in
Ophiopogon japonicus. In total, 28 homoisoflavonoids (including seven
novel constituents) were characterized. The deprotonated [M-H](-)
molecules of the homoisoflavonoids containing a saturated C2-C3 bond
afforded the A or B product ion (base peak) according to whether the
B-ring was substituted with a hydroxyl group. For the homoisoflavonoids
containing a C-2-C-3 double bond, the product ions (A or C ion) were
created from the precursor [M-H](-) ion as the base peak when the B-ring
was substituted with a hydroxyl group. The homoisoflavonoids carrying
a formyl group in the A-ring readily eliminated one molecule of CO to
form the product ion [M+H-CO](-) (base peak) irrespective whether the
C-2-C-3 bond was saturated or not. This product ion afforded the
[M-H-CO-B-ring-CH2+H](-) ion by cleavage of the C3-C9 bond. This latter
product ion always appeared in tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra of type I
homoisoflavonoids. The common features of flavonoids observed during
the gas-phase fragmentation mechanisms were the loss of the following
groups: 15 Da (CH3), 18 Da (H2O), 28 Da (CO), 44 Da (CO2) and 46 Da
(CH2O2). A retro-Diels-Alder (RDA)-like cleavage was also observed for
the homoisoflavonoids. The different gas-phase fragmentation routes
were characterized for the deprotonated molecules obtained from the
various homoisoflavonoids and collision-induced dissociation (CID)
fragmentation differences were noted for the different locations of
the various substituents. In conclusion, we can say that this study

TI Crocetin Inhibits Cell Cycle G(1)/S Transition through Suppressing
Cyclin D1 and Elevating p27(kip1) in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells
SO PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB Crocetin is a natural carotenoid compound isolated from Gardenia
jasminoids Ellis. Our previous study shows that crocetin inhibits
angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)
proliferation. To further explore the mechanism by which crocetin
inhibits VSMCs proliferation, in the present study we examined the
effect of crocetin on cell cycle progression and cell cycle regulatory
proteins. Flow cytometry analysis showed that Ang II elicited
significant increase in the percentage of VSMCs in the S phase, with
a concomitant decline in the percentage of VSMCs in the G(0)/G(1) phase.
However, on pretreatment of VSMCs with crocetin, the percentage of
VSMCs in the S phase decreased, while that in the G(0)/G(1) phase
increased significantly. In addition, Ang II-induced increase of cell
proliferation index was also decreased by crocetin. Western blotting
analysis indicated that crocetin markedly inhibited the protein
expression of cyclin D1 but not cyclin E. Crocetin also increased the
level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p27(kip1) but not
CDKI p27(waf1/cip1). In conclusion, our present results suggest that
the inhibition of cell cycle G(1)/S transition in VSMCs by crocetin
can be attributed, at least in part, to its suppression of cyclin D1
and elevation of CDKI p27(kip1). Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons,

TI Synthesis and characterization of self-assembled CdHgTe/gelatin
nanospheres as stable near infrared fluorescent probes in vivo
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
CT 21st International Symposium on Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis

CL Orlando, FL
AB This work presented a kind of novel near infrared emitting
CdHgTe/gelatin nanospheres which were synthesized with Cd(NO3)(2),
Hg(NO3)(2). NaHTe and a thiol stabilizer in gelatin solution The
self-assembled nanospheres were megranate-like and nearly 40 nm in
diameter, with CdHgTe QDs uniformly embedded in gelatin matrix. They
exhibited strong fluorescence ranging from 580 to 800 nm that could
be tuned by molar ratios of Hg2+ and gelatin. The full widths at
half-maximum of the emission spectra were in the range of 60-80 nm.
Compared with bare CdHgTe QDs, the photostability of this compact
complex nanostructure remarkably improved. Moreover, the fluorescence
of CdHgTe/gelatin nanospheres was much more resistant to the
interference from certain kinds of endogenous biomolecules such as HSA,
transferrin and hemoglobin Further applications of living cells and
mouse imaging were demonstrated with an in vivo near infrared
fluorescence imaging system The Inherent advantages of high stability
as well as high fluorescence intensity make the nanospheres particular
interested NIR bioprobe candidates for in vivo imaging studies (C) 2010

TI Chemical markers' fishing and knockout for holistic activity and
interaction evaluation of the components in herbal medicines
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB A strategy based on chemical markers' fishing and knockout has been
proposed for holistic activity and interaction evaluation of the
bioactive components in herbal medicines (HMs). It was devised to
screen bioactive-compound group that represents the efficacy of HM,
estimate the bioactivity contribution of each component and elucidate
the interactions of multi-components. This strategy was accomplished
through the following steps: (1) screen out the chemical markers
(target peaks) in a HM fingerprint using online two-dimensional
turbulent flow chromatography/liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry technique, (2) fish target peaks and knockout any
interested peak, and (3) evaluate the bioactivities of fishing and
knockout portions. After comparison of the bioactivities of samples
containing different target peaks, the efficacy of target-peak group,
bioactivity contribution of each compound, and the interactions of
multi-components are elucidated. Using Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
and Bulbs of Lycoris radiata (L. Herit.) Herb. (BLR) as the experimental
materials, four target peaks were screened out as the AChE binders.
By target peaks' fishing and knockout, combined with activity
evaluation, we observed that the bioactivity of the four-peak mixture
is similar with the global bioactivity of BLR extract, and there are
significant suppressive actions among these four target peaks. These
results indicate that this proposed strategy is a useful approach for
holistic screening of bioactive-compound group and elucidation of the
multi-component interactions in HM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Regioselective Glucuronidation of Tanshinone IIa after Quinone
Reduction: Identification of Human UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases,
Species Differences, and Interaction Potential
SO DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION
AB We have previously identified that the predominant metabolic pathway
for tanshinone IIa (TSA) in rat is the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase
1 (NQO1)-mediated quinone reduction and subsequent glucuronidation.
The present study contributes to further research on its
glucuronidation enzyme kinetics, the identification of human
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms, and the interaction
potential with typical UGT substrates. A pair of regioisomers (M1 and
M2) of reduced TSA glucuronides was found from human, rat, and mouse,
whereas only M1 was found in dog liver S9 incubations. The overall
glucuronidation clearance of TSA in human liver S9 was 11.8 +/- 0.8
mu l/min/mg protein, 0.7-, 0.8-, and 3-fold of that in the mouse, rat,
and dog, respectively. Using intrinsic clearance M2/M1 as a
regioselective index, opposite regioselectivity was found between
human (0.7) and mouse (1.3), whereas no significant regioselectivity
was found in rat. In a sequential metabolism system, by applying human
liver cytosol as an NQO1 donor combined with a screening panel of 12
recombinant human UGTs, multiple UGTs were found involved in the M1
formation, whereas only UGT1A9 and, to a very minor extent, UGT1A1 and
UGT1A3 contributed to the M2 formation. Further enzyme kinetics,
correlation, and chemical inhibition studies confirmed that UGT1A9
played a major role in both M1 and M2 formation. In addition, TSA
presented a potent inhibitory effect on the glucuronidation of typical
UGT1A9 substrates propofol and mycophenolic acid, with an IC50 value
of 8.4 +/- 1.8 and 8.9 +/- 1.9 mu M, respectively. This study will help
to guide future studies on characterizing the NQO1-mediated reduction
and subsequent glucuronidation of other quinones.

AB Biotransfomation has been increasingly utilized as a tool to generate
pharmaceutical lead compounds from natural products in recent years.
A wide variety of natural pruducts including aromatics, steroids,
alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids and terpenoids can be biotransformed
by fungi, yeasts, bacteria, plant cells and enzymes derived from these
sources. The biochemical reactions occurring in microorganisms and
plant cells are typically regio- and stereo-selective, which is
difficult to be achieved by chemical methods. In this review we describe
important biotransformations used for the generation of lead compounds
with pharmaceutical utilities and further structural diversification
of complex natural products, especially those from traditional Chinese
medicines. Such approach will ultimately benefit the advancement of
biotransformation and potential therapeutics.

TI EFFECTS OF PAMAM DENDRIMERS ON THE SOLUBILITY OF KETOPROFEN
SO ACTA POLYMERICA SINICA
AB The aim of this study was to study the effect of polyamidoamine (PAMAM)
dendrimers on the aqueous solubility of ketoprofen and investigate the
mechanism of solubilization. PAMAM dendrimers of G1. 0, Gl. 5, G2. 0,
G2. 5, G3. 0 and G3. 5 were used as drug carriers of ketoprofen. The
effects of pH and concentration of the dendrimers on the solubility
of ketoprofen were studied by UV spectroscopy. In addition, the
computational simulation was used to investigate the mechanism of
interaction between PAMAM dendrimers and ketoprofen. Results showed
that the pH, generation size, and concentration influenced the
solubilization of ketoprofen. The solubility of ketoprofen increased
with the increase of pH, generation size, and concentration of PAMAM
dendrimers at pH 4.0 similar to 6.0. Both amino and ester terminated
dendrimers caused the increase in ketoprofen solubility. However, at
each pH, the solubility of ketoprofen was greater in the presence of
amino-terminated dendrimers compared to the ester-terminated
dendrimers possessing the same number of surface functional groups.
The results of computational simulation show that interaction between
ketoprofen and PAMAM dendrimers is mainly electrostatic force. Its
mechanism of solubilization maybe an electrostatic interaction between
the carboxyl group of ketoprofen and the primary amines or tertiary
amines of PAMAM dendrimers.

TI Qualitative and quantitative determination of complicated herbal
components by liquid chromatography hybrid ion trap time-of-flight
mass spectrometry and a relative exposure approach to herbal
pharmacokinetics independent of standards
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB To date, the pharmacokinetic research of herbal medicines (HMs) is
still in its infancy and is facing critical technical challenges on
the qualitative and quantitative analysis of complicated components
from biological matrices. Additionally, the lack of authentic
standards constitutes another bottleneck on assessing herbal
pharmacokinetics. This present work contributes to the development of
a powerful technical platform for both qualitative and quantitative
pharmacokinetic analysis of herbal components, and a strategy of
relative exposure that provides a practicable pharmacokinetic
assessment independent of authentic standards, based on the use of
liquid chromatography hybrid ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(LC-IT-TOF/MS). Taking schisandra lignans extract (SLE) as an example,
the LC-IT-TOF/MS assay was initially applied to the global qualitative
analysis of components contained in SLE per se and in the rat plasma
post SLE dosing. Afterwards, this study focused on validating the
quantitative performance of LC-IT-TOF/MS assay by comparison with a
well-established LC-Q/MS assay. For the absolute quantification of
five lignans components with authentic standards, both assays showed
very similar analytical figures of merit such as linearity, precision,
accuracy, and pharmacokinetic parameters. Compared with LC-Q/MS, the
prominent advantage of LC-IT-TOF/MS assay is its much higher
sensitivity. Moreover, a 'relative exposure approach' (REA) that
entails the use of sequentially diluted original herbal preparations
to prepare the 'mixed calibration curves' was developed to assessing
herbal pharmacokinetics independent of specific authentic compounds
for each component. Such an approach was found capable of providing
virtually identical pharmacokinetic parameters as that from the
typical pharmacokinetic assay calibrated by authentic standards,
except for the absolute plasma concentrations. The presently developed
methodology and approach will find its wide use in, but not limited
to, the qualitative and quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis of
herbal medicines. (C) 2010 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

TI Release of copper and indomethacin from intrauterine devices immersed
in simulated uterine fluid
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTRACEPTION AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE
AB Objectives To study the release of cupric ions and indomethacin from
copper-bearing intrauterine devices (Cu-IUDs) and to assess the
influence of their surface area of copper and the pH of the test medium
on the release of cupric ions.
Methods Cu-IUDs were incubated in simulated uterine fluid (SUF). The
in vitro release of cupric ions and indomethacin was determined by means
of a flame atomic absorption spectrometer and a UV752
spectrophotometer, respectively, over a period of 220 days. The effect
of indomethacin on the pH of the SUF was monitored during the cupric
ions release study.
Results The Cu-IUDs released cupric ions in vitro according to a
biphasic pattern. After an initial burst release, the rate slowed down
and then became steady. The release of indomethacin from two medicated
Cu-IUDs was biphasic and, in both cases, in accordance with the in vitro
dissolution model of the drug. The surface area of copper of Cu-IUDs
and the pH change induced by indomethacin incorporated in their frame
affected the release rate of copper (p < 0.05).
Conclusion The surface area of the copper and the pH of the test medium
modulate the in vitro release of cupric ions from Cu-IUDs.

AB A highly selective and sensitive liquid chromatographic tandem mass
spectrometric (LC-MS-MS) method was developed and validated for the
quantitation and pharmacokinetic study of niacin (NA) and its two
metabolites niacinamide (NAM) and nicotinuric acid (NUR) in human
plasma. Protein precipitation with 14% perchloric acid solution was
selected for sample preparation, and ganciclovir was used as an
internal standard. Separation was on a Phenomenex Curosil-PFP (250 mm
x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m) column by a multiple steep steps linear gradient
elution with mobile phase consisting of water and methanol, both
containing 0.1% formic acid, pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1).
The determination was optimized and carried out with positive
electrospray ionization by selective multiple reaction monitoring. The
method was linear in the concentration range of 15-2,000 ng mL(-1) for
NA, 70-2,000 ng mL(-1) for NAM and 10-2,000 ng mL(-1) for NUR, by
standard addition calibration. The application of LC-MS-MS was
demonstrated for the specific and quantitative analysis of NA, NAM and

TI Investigation of the Enantioseparation of Basic Drugs with
Erythromycin Lactobionate as a Chiral Selector in CE
SO CHROMATOGRAPHIA
AB The macrocyclic antibiotics including ansamycins, glycopeptides,
aminoglycosides and polypeptides have been demonstrated to exhibit
powerful enantioselectivity towards numerous chiral compounds. By
comparison with the four classes of antibiotics, macrolides are another
type of macrocyclic antibiotics. In this study erythromycin
lactobionate belonging to the group of macrolides is first used as a
chiral selector in CE for the enantiomeric separations of basic drugs.
As observed, erythromycin lactobionate allowed excellent separation
of the enantiomers of
N,N-dimethyl-3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-3-propylamine, propranolol and
duloxetine, as well as partial enantioresolution of primaquine,
chloroquine and nefopam. In addition, erythromycin lactobionate
possesses advantages such as high solubility and low viscosity in the
solvent and very weak UV absorption. Among several experimental factors
including buffer pH, BGE and erythromycin lactobionate concentrations,
capillary temperature and applied voltage, we found that the
enantioseparations of basic drugs above-mentioned strongly depended
on the pH of BGE and the concentration of the chiral additive. The
optimum pH was in the neutral or weak basic region but varied among
drugs. An erythromycin lactobionate concentration of about 10% (w/v)
and a low capillary temperature of 16 A degrees C were recommended for
the practical analysis.

TI Effect of RGD-4C Position is More Important Than Disulfide Bonds on
Antiangiogenic Activity of RGD-4C Modified Endostatin Derived
Synthetic Polypeptide
SO BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
AB ES-2 (IVRRADRAAVP), an endostatin-derived synthetic polypeptide,
contains the amino acids 50-60 of endostatin from its N terminus, and
it had no inhibitory effects on tumor growth in vivo. In order to
increase the targeted delivery of ES-2 to tumors and further enhance
the activity, the polypeptide RGD-4C (ACDCRGDCFC) was introduced into
ES-2, and the effects of RGD-4C position and RGD-4C disulfide bonds
on polypeptides activity were investigated. When RGD-4C polypeptides
(with or without disulfide bonds) were introduced to the N-terminals
of synthesized ES-2, the modified ES-2 showed significant antitumor
activity in vivo. Cell proliferation and chicken chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) assay results showed that disulfide bonds had no
significant effects on RGD-4C-modified ES-2 antiangiogenic activity.
Furthermore, the target of modified peptides was integrin alpha 5/beta

TI A visual chip-based coimmunoprecipitation technique for analysis of
protein-protein interactions
SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Here we report a visual chip-based coimmunoprecipitation (vChip-coIP)
platform for analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by
combining advantages of an antibody microarray, traditional coIP, and
a silver enhancement detection method. The chip was fabricated by
spotting anti-Flag antibody on aldehyde-modified slides, and the
resulting platform could assay immunoprecipitate from a small amount
of crude cell lysates containing Flag-bait and Myc-prey. The
interaction signals are visible using biotinylated anti-Myc antibody
and colloidal gold-labeled streptavidin followed by a silver
enhancement detection method. It is shown that vChip-coIP is a simple,
cost-effective, and highly efficient platform for the comprehensive
study of PPIs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Preparation and characterization of tramadol PEG-coated
multivesicular liposomes for sustained release
SO PHARMAZIE
AB The purpose of the present study was to prepare multivesicular
liposomes (MVL) with a high drug loading capacity for intramuscular
sustained release and to investigate their potential applicability
towards tramadol, and to improve the stability of liposomes by coating
PEG. The basic physiochemical properties of tramadol MVLs and
PEG-coated MVLs were studied. The average particle sizes of optimum
preparation were 18.2 mu m and 31.3 mu m. The entrapment efficiency
was up to 80%. The encapsulation efficiency of tramadol MVLs and
PEG-coated MVLs was measured. The results confirmed the possibility
of multivesicular liposomes as a sustained-release delivery system.
Tramadol was continuously released from MVL formulations in PBS (pH6.8)
in vitro, and reached a maximum of 80% within 72 h. The results show
that tramadol PEG-coated MVLs could provide sustained release
according to the first order kinetic equation.

TI Characterization and in vitro cellular uptake of PEG coated iron oxide
nanoparticles as MRI contrast agent
SO PHARMAZIE
AB Monodisperse magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs), coated with PEG
at different molecular weight, were prepared via self-assembly method.
The particle diameters were measured by dynamic light scattering and
transmission electron microscope. Increasing the molecular weight of
PEG in the coating polymer increased the overall particles diameter.
As coating thickness increased, the saturation magnetization (Ms) and
T-2 relaxivity decreased. The interactions of these MNPs with
macrophage cells were also investigated. The results showed that
cellular uptakes of MNPs depended on nanoparticle concentration and
surface chemistry. The results of this study will have implications
on the chemical design of nanomaterials for bio-imaging and
bio-detection.

TI Interaction of CJZ3, a lomerizine derivative, with ATPase activity of
human P-glycoprotein in doxorubicin-resistant human myelogenous
leukemia (K562/DOX) cells
SO PHARMAZIE
AB P-Glycoprotein, a 170-180 kDa membrane glycoprotein that mediates
multidrug resistance, hydrolyses ATP to efflux a broad spectrum of
hydrophobic agents. To observe the interaction of a P-gp reversal agent
with P-gp ATPase activity should provide further insights into the
mechanisms of P-gp modulator. In this study, we analysed the effect
of CJZ3, a lomerizine derivative, on the adenosine triphosphatase
(ATPase) activity of human P-glycoprotein. The results showed that the
basal P-gp ATPase activity was increased by CJZ3 with half-maximal
activity concentration (Km) of 6.8 +/- 1.5 mu M, CJZ3 may interact with
P-gp with a higher affinity and exhibit a more potent effect than
verapamil (Ver). Kinetic analysis indicated a noncompetitive
inhibition of Ver-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity and a competitive
inhibition of CJX2-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity by CJZ3, moreover,
the effect of CsA on CJZ3-stimulated and Ver-stimulated P-gp ATPase
activity showed a non-competitive and a competitive inhibition
respectively. CJZ3 and CJX2 can bind P-gp either on overlapping sites
or distinct but interacting sites, while CJZ3 and Ver as well as CsA
can bind P-gp on separated sites in K562/DOX cells.

TI Tethered derivatives of D-glucose and pentacyclic triterpenes for
homo/heterobivalent inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase
SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB Propargyl esters of the C-28 carboxylic acids of pentacyclic
triterpenes (oleanolic, ursolic, and maslinic acids) were coupled with
2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl azide as well as
N-(omega-azido-[C-2, C-6, and
C-11]alkanoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosylamines under conditions of
copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) to give
tethered D-glucose-triterpene heteroconjugates. The O-acetyl
protecting groups were removed by base-catalyzed hydrolysis.
N-(omega-Azido-[C-2, C-6, C-11, and
C-16]alkanoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosylamines were also tethered by
1,7-octadiyne under CuAAC conditions to furnish D-glucose
homoconjugates. O-Deacetylation was carried out by the Zemplen
protocol. The new compounds were assayed against rabbit muscle glycogen
phosphorylase (RMGP) a or b enzymes. Some of the heteroconjugates
inhibited the enzyme in the low micromolar range (IC50 values 40-70
mu M), while the homoconjugates proved inefficient as inhibitors.

TI Anti-obesity effect of an isoflavone fatty acid ester on obese mice
induced by high fat diet and its potential mechanism
SO LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE
AB Background: The novel compound 1a is one of the isoflavone fatty acid
esters. In order to investigate the anti-obesity effect of compound
1a and its potential mechanism of influence in adipocyte
differentiation, Obese male C57BL/6J mice induced by high-fat diet
(HFD) and rat preadipocytes (3T3-L1 cell) were used.
Methods: After 4-week HFD induction, the obese model was made
successfully. After treatment with compound 1a, mice plasma
biochemistry parameters were analyzed. In addition, mice hepatic
tissue slice was observed. In in vitro research, 3T3-L1 cell
differentiation by Oil-Red-O staining and adipocyte apoptosis was
detected by flow cytometry.
Results: The in vivo results implied that compound 1a significantly
decreased the body weight, white adipose tissue weight of obesity
mice(p < 0.05), reduced leptin and TG in plasma(p < 0.05), elevated
HDL-C in serum(p < 0.05). The in vitro results suggested that compound
1a could significantly suppress the adipocyte viability and lipid
accumulation in the differentiation of preadipocyte, and induce
apoptosis in both preadipocytes and mature adipocytes(p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Compound 1a regulates serum lipid profiles, decreases
adipose tissue mass and body weight gain by inducing adipocyte
apoptosis in high fat diet induced mice. Thus, it may be used to treat
obese patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

TI Prevention of HIV Protease Inhibitor-Induced Dysregulation of Hepatic
Lipid Metabolism by Raltegravir via Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress
Signaling Pathways
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS
AB Hyperlipidemia associated with the HIV protease inhibitor (PI), the
major component of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for
HIV infection, has stimulated interest in developing new agents that
minimize these side effects in the clinic. HIV integrase inhibitor is
a new class of anti-HIV agents. Raltegravir is a first-in-its-class
oral integrase inhibitor and has potent inhibitory activity against
HIV-1 strains that are resistant to other antiretroviral regimens. Our
previous studies have demonstrated that HIV PI-induced endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress links to dysregulation of lipid metabolism.
However, little information is available as to whether raltegravir
would have similar effects as the HIV PIs. In this study, we examined
the effect of raltegravir on lipid metabolism both in primary rat
hepatocytes and in in vivo mouse models, and we further determined
whether the combination of raltegravir with existing HIV PIs would
potentially exacerbate or prevent the previously observed development
of dyslipidemia. The results indicated that raltegravir did not induce
ER stress or disrupt lipid metabolism either in vitro or in vivo.
However, HIV PI-induced ER stress and lipid accumulation were
significantly inhibited by raltegravir both in in vitro primary rat
hepatocytes and in in vivo mouse liver. High-performance liquid
chromatography analysis further demonstrated that raltegravir did not
affect the uptake and metabolism of HIV PIs in hepatocytes. Thus,
raltegravir has less hepatic toxicity and could prevent HIV PI-induced
dysregulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting ER stress. These
results suggest that incorporation of this HIV integrase inhibitor may
reduce the side effects associated with current HAART.

TI TOP2 gene disruption reduces drug susceptibility by increasing
intracellular ergosterol biosynthesis in Candida albicans
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB In this study the role of the TOP2 gene in fungal drug susceptibility
was investigated by disrupting and overexpressing the gene in Candida
albicans. MIC determination and a spot assay showed that a top2
Delta/Delta null mutant (strain T2bc) was more resistant to the
antifungals tested than the wildtype (strain CAI4). Real-time RT-PCR
and rhodamine 6G efflux examination showed that TOP2 did not influence
the activity of drug efflux pumps. Sterol analysis with
GC/high-resolution MS indicated that the intracellular ergosterol
composition of the top2 Delta/Delta mutant was significantly
increased. Subsequently, fluorescence polarization measurements also
revealed that Top2-deprived cells displayed a decrease in membrane
fluidity, resulting in enhanced passive diffusion of the drugs.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis further confirmed that the
ERG11 gene, an essential gene in ergosterol biosynthesis, was
upregulated. These results demonstrate a close relationship between
the TOP2 gene and drug susceptibility in C. albicans.

TI Effect of Sperminated Pullulans on Drug Permeation Through Isolated
Rabbit Cornea and Determination of Ocular Irritation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two sperminated
pullulans (SP) with a different number of amino groups (SP-L, amino
group content 0.124 mmol/g polymer; and SP-H, amino group content 0.578
mmol/g polymer) on the permeation of drugs through isolated rabbit
corneas. Determination of corneal hydration levels and Draize eye tests
were performed to assess the safety of SP both in vitro and in vivo.
For 0.2% (w/v) SP-L and 0.2% (w/v) SP-H, the enhancement ratios (ERs)
with dexamethasone of 1.34 and 1.42, respectively, were not
statistically significant. For ofloxacin, tobramycin and sodium
fluorescein, the ERs with 0.2% SP-L were 1.37, 2.02 and 2.12,
respectively, and with 0.2% SP-H the ERs were 1.84, 4.69 and 6.87,
respectively; these ERs were all statistically significant.
Enhancement increased with increasing amino group content of the SP.
The improved transcorneal drug absorption via the paracellular route
indicated opening of the tight junctions in the corneal epithelium.
Irritation tests indicated that 0.2% SP-L and 0.2% SP-H did not damage
the corneal tissues.

TI Myristic acid-conjugated polyethylenimine for brain-targeting
delivery: in vivo and ex vivo imaging evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF DRUG TARGETING
AB To investigate the potential of myristic acid (MC) to mediate brain
delivery of polyethylenimine (PEI) as a gene delivery system, a
covalent conjugate (MC-PEI) of MC, and PEI was synthesized. A
near-infrared fluorescence probe, IR820 was conjugated to MC-PEI to
explore its in vivo distribution after intravenous (i.v.)
administration in mice. The brain targeting ability of MC-PEI was
evaluated by near-infrared fluorescence imaging and analyzed
semiquantitatively by fluorescence intensity, respectively.
Significant NIR fluorescent signal was detected in the brain 12 h after
i.v. administration and further confirmed by imaging the whole brain
and brain slices. Semiquantitative results from fluorescence intensity
further supported the successful brain delivery of MC-PEI which led
to a very significant increase (similar to 200%) in the brain uptake
after i.v. injection in comparison with unmodified PEI. The capability
of MC-PEI to condense DNA was further confirmed using agarose gel
retardation assay, indicating its potential for gene delivery. The
significant in vivo and ex vivo results suggest that MC-PEI is a
promising brain-targeting drug delivery system, especially for gene
delivery.

TI Facile synthesis of high-quality water-soluble
N-acetyl-L-cysteine-capped Zn1-xCdxSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots
emitting in the violet-green spectral range
SO JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB In this paper, we report a new facile method to synthesize water-soluble
Zn1-xCdxSe and core/shell Zn1-xCdxSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) emitting
in the violet-green spectral range, using N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)
as a stabilizer. The influence of various experimental variables,
including the precursor Zn/Cd/Se/NAC molar ratios, the pH of original
solution and the refluxing time on optical properties were explored
systematically. The obtained aqueous Zn1-xCdxSe QDs exhibit a tunable
photoluminescence (PL) emission (from similar to 415 nm to 506 nm) and
a favorable narrow PL bandwidth (FWHM: 27-38 nm). After coating with
a ZnS shell, the PL emission intensity of the formed core/shell
Zn1-xCdxSe/ZnS QDs is greatly increased (PL quantum yield (QY): similar
to 30%). These resulting Zn1-xCdxSe and core/shell Zn1-xCdxSe/ZnS QDs
were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In
addition, the cytotoxicity and the fluorescence imaging of
Zn1-xCdxSe/ZnS QDs to MCF-7 cells were preliminarily investigated. The
experimental results show that the as-prepared violet-green-emitting
Zn1-xCdxSe/ZnS QDs have low cytotoxicity, which makes them an ideal
inorganic fluorescent probe for biolabeling and cell imaging. (C) 2010

TI Increased Plasma Exposures of Five Protoberberine Alkaloids from
Coptidis Rhizoma in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats: Is P-GP
Involved?
SO PLANTA MEDICA
AB Our previous study showed a higher exposure of berberine, palmatine,
coptisine, epiberberine and jatrorrhizine in 6-week streptozotocin
(STZ)-induced diabetic rats, after oral administration of Coptidis
Rhizoma extract. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether
the function and expression of intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-GP) was
downregulated in STZ-induced diabetic rats and if the impairment of
P-GP function and expression contributed to the exposure increase of
the five protoberberine alkaloids. Plasma concentration-time profiles
of the drugs in the portal vein were obtained after oral administration
of Coptidis Rhizoma extract. The effective permeability of the drug
across duodenum and ileum were measured using in situ single-pass
intestine perfusion. P-GP function in the rat intestine was assessed
by measuring the absorption of rhodamine 123 (Rho123). P-GP levels were
evaluated using Western blots. It was found that the C-max and AUC(0-8)
values of five alkaloids in the portal vein of diabetic rats were
significantly higher than those in the control rats. Diabetic rats also
exhibitd a higher level of Rho123 in the portal vein, which showed
impairment of P-GP function. A higher effective permeability of the
tested drug was found in the duodenum of diabetic rats using in situ
single-pass intestine perfusion, indicating that berberine and Rho123
transported more easily across the intestinal barrier of diabetic rats.
A lower level of P-GP protein was found in the duodenum, jejunum and
ileum of the diabetic rats as compared with age-matched control rats.
All these results suggested that the function and expression of P-GP
were impaired in the intestine of STZ-induced diabetic rats which, at
least partly, contributed to the exposure increase of the five
protoberberine alkaloids.

TI beta-Glucan Oligosaccharide Enhances CD8(+) TCells Immune Response
Induced by a DNA Vaccine Encoding Hepatitis B Virus Core Antigen
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB DNA vaccination can induce specific CD8(+) T cell immune response, but
the response level is low in large mammals and human beings.
Coadministration of an adjuvant can optimize protective immunity
elicited by a DNA vaccine. In this study, we investigated the effect
of a synthetic glucohexaose (beta-glu6), an analogue of Lentinan basic
unit, on specific CD8(+) T cell response induced by a DNA vaccine
encoding HBcAg (pB144) in mice. We found that beta-glu6 promoted the
recruitment and maturation of dendritic cells, enhanced the activation
of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells and increased the number of specific
CD8(+)/IFN-gamma(+) T cells in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues in mice
immunized by pB144. Immunization with pB144 and beta-glu6 increased
the anti-HBc IgG and IgG2a antibody titer. These results demonstrate
that beta-glu6 can enhance the virus-specific CTL and Th1 responses
induced by DNA vaccine, suggesting beta-glu6 as a candidate adjuvant
in DNA vaccination.

TI Synthesis and characterization of low-toxic amphiphilic chitosan
derivatives and their application as micelle carrier for antitumor drug
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
AB A new series of amphiphilically modified chitosan molecules with long
alkyl chains as hydrophobic moieties and glycol groups as hydrophilic
moieties (N-octyl-O-glycol chitosan, OGC) was synthesized for use as
drug carriers. The chemical structure was characterized by Fourier
transform infrared, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance, and elemental
analysis. OGC could easily self-assemble to form nanomicelles in an
aqueous environment and exhibited a low critical micellar
concentration of 5.3-32.5 mg/L The biocompatibility and low toxicity
of OGC as excipient for the dosage forms aimed at iv. administration
were confirmed by hemolysis, acute toxicity and histopathological
studies. Furthermore, the possibility of solubilizing paclitaxel
(PTX), a water-insoluble antitumor drug, with OGC micelles was also
explored. PTX was successfully loaded into OGC micelles by using a
simple dialysis process. The drug-loading capacity of OGC and stability
of drug-loaded micelles were significantly affected by the degree of
substitution of alkyl chains. Moreover, a series of safety studies
including hemolysis, hypersensitivity, maximum tolerated dose, acute
toxicity, and organ toxicity revealed that the PTX-loaded OGC micelles
had advantages over the commercially available injectable preparation
of PTX (Taxol (R)), in terms of low toxicity levels and increased
tolerated dose. Additionally, cytotoxicity studies showed that the
PTX-loaded OGC micelles were comparable to the commercial formulation,
but the blank micelles were far less toxic than the Cremophor EL
vehicle. These results suggest that OGC is a promising carrier for
injectable Pp( micelles. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Anti-arthritic effect of scopoletin, a coumarin compound occurring in
Erycibe obtusifolia Benth stems, is associated with decreased
angiogenesis in synovium
SO FUNDAMENTAL & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB Scopoletin is the main constituent of coumarin found in the stems of
Erycibe obtusifolia Benth, a traditional Chinese medicine used in the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We have previously demonstrated
that scopoletin is able to decrease the serum level of uric acid in
hyperuricemic mice induced by potassium oxonate, and attenuate croton
oil-induced inflammation. In the present study, we evaluated the
anti-arthritic effects of scopoletin in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis
by assessing paw swelling, pathology, and synovial angiogenesis. It
was found that scopoletin, injected intraperitoneally at doses of 50,
100 mg/kg, reduced both inoculated and non-inoculated paw swelling as
well as articular index scores, and elevated the mean body weight of
adjuvant-induced arthritic rats. Rats treated with higher dose of
scopoletin showed a near-normal histological architecture of the
joints and a reduced new blood vessel formation in the synovial tissues.
Furthermore, scopoletin downregulated the overexpression of vascular
endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and
interleukin 6 in the synovial tissues of adjuvant-induced arthritic
rats. In conclusion, scopoletin is capable of ameliorating clinical
symptoms of rat adjuvant-induced arthritis, by reducing numbers of new
blood vessels in the synovium and the production of important
endogenous angiogenic inducers. Therefore, this compound may be a
potential agent for angiogenesis-related diseases and could serve as
a structural base for screening more potent synthetic analogs.

TI (+/-)-Praeruptorin A enantiomers exert distinct relaxant effects on
isolated rat aorta rings dependent on endothelium and nitric oxide
synthesis
SO CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS
AB Praeruptorin A is a coumarin compound naturally occurring in the roots
of Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn., a commonly used traditional Chinese
medicine for the treatment of certain respiratory diseases and
hypertension. Although previous studies indicated the relaxant effects
of (+/-)-praeruptorin A on tracheal and arterial preparations, little
is known about the functional characteristics of the enantiomers. In
the present study, the two enantiomers were successfully isolated and
identified by using a preparative Daicel Chiralpak AD-H column, and
their relaxant effects on aorta rings were observed and compared.
(+)-Praeruptorin A showed more potent relaxation than (-)-praeruptorin
A against KCl- and phenylephrine-induced contraction of rat isolated
aortic rings with intact endothelium. Removal of the endothelium
remarkably reduced the relaxant effect of (+)-praeruptorin A but not
that of (-)-praeruptorin A. Pretreatment of aortic rings with
N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric
oxide synthase) or methylene blue (MB, a soluble guanylyl cyclase
inhibitor) resulted in similar changes of the relaxant effects of the
two enantiomers to endothelium removal. Molecular docking studies also
demonstrated that (+)-praeruptorin A was in more agreement to nitric
oxide synthase pharmacophores than (-)-praeruptorin A. On the other
hand, the two enantiomers of praeruptorin A could slightly attenuate
the contraction of rat aortic rings induced by internal Ca2+ release
from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These findings indicated that
(+)-praeruptorin A and (-)-praeruptorin A exerted distinct relaxant
effects on isolated rat aorta rings, which might be mainly attributed
to nitric oxide synthesis catalyzed by endothelial nitric oxide
synthase. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mitochondria-targeting photosensitizer-encapsulated amorphous
nanocage as a bimodal reagent for drug delivery and biodiagnose in vitro
SO BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES
AB The use of ceramic nano-carriers containing anti-cancer drugs for
targeted delivery that span both fundamental and applied research has
attracted the interest of the scientific community. In this paper, a
hydrophobic photodynamic therapy drug, hypocrellin A (HA), was
successfully encapsulated in water-soluble amorphous silica nanocage
(HANC) by an improved sol-gel method. These nanocages are of ultrasmall
size, highly monodispersed, stable in aqueous suspension, and retain
the optical properties of HA. Moreover, these nanocages can be
effectively delivered, subsequently taken up by cancer cells and
finally targeted to mitochondria. In addition, incubation time
dependent photodynamic efficacy difference between HANC and HA was
investigated for the first time. Especially, the nanocages, owning
extremely high stable fluorescence comparing with free HA, also have
potentials as efficient probes for optical biodiagnose in vitro. All
these properties of HANC could possibly make it especially promising
to be used as a bimodal reagent for photodynamic therapy and
biodiagnose.

TI Effects of Metal Exposure on Associative Learning Behavior in Nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans
SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB In the present study, the thermotaxis model was used to evaluate the
effects of metal exposure at different concentrations on associative
learning behavior in nematodes. The examined nematodes were cultured
at 25 or 17A degrees C, and then shifted to 20A degrees C condition.
Based on the ability of nematodes to trace the temperature of 20A
degrees C, exposure to 10 mu M of all examined metals and 2.5 mu M Pb
and Hg caused significant decrease of associative learning behavior
at time intervals of 5 and 18 h; however, exposure to 2.5 mu M Cu, Zn,
and Ag did not influence associative learning behavior. Moreover,
exposure to 2.5 and 10 mu M of examined metals did not influence body
bend and thermotaxis to cultivation temperature, whereas exposure to
50 mu M of examined metals caused significant reduction of body bend
and thermotaxis to cultivation temperature. Furthermore, Pb and Hg were
the more toxic among the examined metals, with severe toxicity on
associative learning behavior, thermotaxis, and locomotion behavior
in nematodes.

TI Universal Method Facilitating the Amplification of Extremely GC-Rich
DNA Fragments from Genomic DNA
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a basic technique with wide
applications in molecular biology. Despite the development of
different methods with various modifications, the amplification of
GC-rich DNA fragments is frequently troublesome due to the formation
of complex secondary structure and poor denaturation. Given the fact
that GC-rich genes are closely related to transcriptional regulation,
transcriptional silencing, and disease progression, we developed a PCR
method combining a stepwise procedure and a mixture of additives in
the present work. Our study demonstrated that the PCR method could
successfully amplify targeted DNA fragments up to 1.2 Kb with GC content
as high as 83.5% from different species. Compared to all currently
available methods, our work showed satisfactory, adaptable, fast and
efficient (SAFE) results on the amplification of GC-rich targets, which
provides a versatile and valuable tool for the diagnosis of genetic
disorders and for the study of functions and regulations of various
genes.

TI Mast cell degranulation induced by chlorogenic acid
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To investigate the mechanism of chlorogenic acid (CA)-induced
anaphylactoid reactions. Methods: Degranulation of peritoneal mast
cells was assayed by using alcian blue staining in guinea pigs, and
the degranulation index (DI) was calculated. CA-induced degranulation
of RBL-2H3 cells was also observed and assayed using light microscopy,
transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and
beta-hexosaminidase release.
Results: CA 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 mmol/L was able to promote degranulation
of peritoneal mast cells in guinea pigs in vitro, but it did not increase
the degranulation of peritoneal mast cells in CA-sensitized guinea pigs
compared with control (P>0.05). Treatment with CA 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0
mmol/L for 30, 60, and 120 min induced degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells
in a dose-and time-dependent manner (P<0.01). Under transmission
electron microscope typical characteristics of degranulation,
including migration of granular vesicles toward the plasma membrane
and integration combined with exocytosis, were observed, after CA or
C48/80 treatment. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometric analysis
showed that CA induced concentration-dependent translocation of
phosphatidylserine in RBL-2H3 cells. beta-hexosaminidase release in
RBL-2H3 cells was significantly increased after incubation with 1
mmol/L CA for 60 min and 5 mmol/L CA for 30 min (P<0.01).
Conclusion: CA induces degranulation of peritoneal mast cells and
RBL-2H3 cells in guinea pigs, which might be one of the mechanisms of
the generation of anaphylactoid reactions induced by CA.

TI Downregulation of both gene expression and activity of Hsp27 improved
maturation of mouse oocyte in vitro
SO REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Background: Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), a member of the small heat
shock protein family, is an apoptosis regulator. Our previous proteomic
study showed that Hsp27 mainly expressed in human oocyte, and that Hsp27
expression was downregulated in the ovaries derived from women with
the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a well known endocrinal disorder
with abnormal apoptotic activity and folliculogenesis. However, the
exact effects of Hsp27 downregulation on oocyte development have not
yet been clarified.
Methods: The expression of Hsp27 gene was downregulated in the mouse
oocytes cultured in vitro using siRNA adenovirus infection, while the
activity of Hsp27 was decreased by microinjection of polyclonal Hsp27
antibody into the cytoplasm of germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes. Oocyte
maturation rate was evaluated by morphological observation. Early
stage of apoptosis was determined using Annexin-V staining analysis
and some critical apoptotic factors and cytokines were also monitored
at both mRNA level by real time RT-PCR and protein expression level
by immunofluorescence and western blot.
Results: Hsp27 expressed at high level in maturing oocytes. Infection
with AdshHsp27, and microinjection of Hsp27 antibody into GV oocytes,
resulted in the improved oocyte development and maturation. Germinal
vesicle breakdown (GVBD) rates were significantly increased in two
AdshHsp27-treated groups (88.7%, 86.0%) and Hsp27 antibody-injected
group (77.0%) when compared with control (76.2% in AdGFP, 64.4% in
IgG-injected), respectively. In addition, the rates of metaphase II
(MII) development in two AdshHsp27-treated groups (73.8%, 76.4%) and
Hsp27 antibody-injected group (67.3%) were higher than that in the
controls (59.6% in AdGFP, 55.1% in IgG-injected). We also found that
the rates of early stage of apoptosis in Hsp27 downregulated groups
(46.5% and 45.6%) were higher than that in control group (34.1%) after
8 h of IVM. Similarly, downregulation of Hsp27 caused a significantly
enhanced the expression of apoptotic factors (caspase 8, caspase 3)
and cytokines (bmp 15 and gdf 9).
Conclusions: Downregulation of Hsp27 improved the maturation of mouse
oocytes, while increased early stage of apoptosis in oocytes by
inducing the activation of extrinsic, caspase 8-mediated pathway.

AB Methyl protodioscin (MPD), a natural furostanol saponin, showed
distinct antitumor activity and is distributed in many traditional
Chinese medicines. The pharmacokinetics, distribution and excretion
of MPD were first investigated after i.v. injection to rats in this
study. The dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of MPD were characterized
after i.v. injection (20, 40 and 120 mg/kg of MPD) to rats. A good
linearity (r = 0.9989, P < 0.05) was found in the regression analysis
of the AUC(0-t) -dose. The plasma concentrations of MPD declined
rapidly with an elimination half-life (t(1/2)) from 25.56 to 29.32 min.
The MPD kinetics was in line with one-compartment model after i.v.
injection. 23.43% and 32.86% of MPD was recovered in urine and bile,
respectively. The concentrations of MPD in plasma and most examined
tissues 5 h after injection were close to or below the Low Limit of
Quantification (LLOQ). This indicated that MPD was distributed and
eliminated rapidly in rats.

adjuvant arthritis
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Objective: To investigate the immunomodulating mechanisms of a Chinese
herbal medicine Yi Shen Juan Bi (YJB) in treatment of adjuvant arthritis
(AA) in rats. Materials and Methods: Levels of serum tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) were measured by the
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Expression of TNF- mRNA and
IL-1 mRNA in synovial cells was measured with the semi-quantitative
technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR), while caspase-3 was examined by western blot analysis.
Results: The administration of YJB significantly decreased the
production of serum TNF- and IL-1. It also decreased significantly the
TNF- mRNA, IL-1 mRNA, and caspase-3 expression in synoviocytes.
Conclusions: YJB produces the immunomodulatory effects by
downregulating the over-activated cytokines, while it activates
caspase-3, which is the key executioner of apoptosis in the immune
system. This may be the one of the underlying mechanisms that explains
how YJB treats the rheumatoid arthritis.

TI The Effects of a Fat- and Sugar-Enriched Diet and Chronic Stress on
Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Male Wistar Rats
SO DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES
AB The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still
under debate. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
a long-term fat- and sugar-enriched diet (FSED) and chronic stress (CS)
on NAFLD.
Male Wistar rats were fed on either a standard diet or a FSED and given
CS, a random electric foot shock (2 hr/morning and afternoon per day),
or not for 12 weeks. After the experimental period, epididymal adipose
tissue weight, sign of visceral obesity (VO), and hepatic index (HI)
were measured. At sacrifice blood samples and liver were obtained.
Histology of the liver was blindly determined by a pathologist.
Histopathologically, moderate to severe steatosis, ballooning
hepatocytes, and portal or lobules inflammation were observed in the
FSED+CS group. However, mild to moderate steatosis with a few portal
inflammation in the FSED group and mild steatosis or not with a few
portal inflammation in the CS group were found correspondingly. In
addition, more severe blood-fat disorder, high HI, fatty metabolic
dysfunction, oxidative stress, high expressions of C-reactive protein
mRNA and low expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
alpha mRNA in the liver were also revealed in the FSED+CS group. But,
the degree of VO was not different between the FSED and FSED+CS groups.
The observations strongly suggest that chronic stress can aggravate
fat- and sugar-enriched diet-induced NAFLD from steatosis to
steatohepatitis in male Wistar rats, although VO is not changed.

TI Photocatalytic mineralization of dimethoate in aqueous solutions using
TiO2: Parameters and by-products analysis
SO DESALINATION
AB Photocatalytic mineralization of dimethoate using nanosized TiO2 at
different conditions has been investigated. The objective of this work
was to study the influence on the photocatalytic mineralization of
dimethoate, of various parameters and identify intermediates formed
during photocatalytic treatment. The mineralization efficiency of
dimethoate increased with elevated concentration of humic acid up to
5 mg/L, while the efficiency reduced when the concentration was above
5 mg/L due to competitive adsorption. The presence of CH3COCH3 can
significantly inhibit dimethoate mineralization and the half-life of
mineralization efficiency was increased by about 3 times. The photo
mineralization efficiency changed with increasing concentrations of
inorganic ions. With respect to the ions of Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, HCO3and NO3-, the mineralization efficiency increased with increasing
concentration of ions and reached a maximum at optimal concentrations,
which was followed by a decrease with a further increase in ion
concentrations. By contrast, the mineralization of dimethoate was
strongly inhibited by Cl- and Cr3+ ions. Intermediate products from
dimethoate were identified by means of GC MS and four possible
by-products were identified. A proposed mineralization pathway for
dimethoate is presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Physicochemical and Pharmacokinetic Characterization of a Spray-Dried
Cefpodoxime Proxetil Nanosuspension
SO CHEMICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB Cefpodoxime proxetil (CP) is a prodrug, the third generation
cephem-type broad-spectrum antibiotic administered orally. However,
CP was found to be a poorly water-soluble drug with low bioavailability
when orally administered. In the present investigation, the
spray-dried cefpodoxime proxetil nanosuspension (SDN) was prepared.
The physicochemical properties were characterized by rheological
evaluation, particle size measurement and its distribution, dynamics
of reconstitution, in-vitro dissolution testing, surface morphology,
surface area and pore size measurements. The pharmacokinetic study of
SDN, in comparison to a marketed cefpodoxime proxetil for oral
suspension (MS), was also performed in rabbits after a single oral dose.
It was found that SDN exhibited a significant decrease in t(max), a
1.60-fold higher area under curve (AUC) and 2.33-fold higher maximum
plasma concentration (C-max) than MS.

TI Resveratrol modulates adipokine expression and improves insulin
sensitivity in adipocytes: Relative to inhibition of inflammatory
responses
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB Resveratrol is a potent inhibitor of inflammation and has anti-diabetic
potentiality, however whether its anti-inflammatory potency
contributes to the amelioration of diabetes or insulin resistance
remains to be determined. This study aims at evaluating the effects
of resveratrol on inflammation-related adipokines expression and
insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. We stimulated RAW264.7 cells with
LPS and collected the supernatant as a conditioned medium (CM) for the
culture of adipocytes. Resveratrol, at concentrations ranging from 0.1
to 10 mu M, effectively inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
INF-alpha and IL-6 production with the downregulation of relative genes
expression in macrophages. Exposing differentiated 3T3-L1 cells to
RAW264.7 CM resulted in gene over-expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and
resistin, however, mRNA expression of adiponectin and PPAR gamma were
down-regulated. Pretreatment of CM from resveratrol-treated
macrophages reduced the elevated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and
significantly reversed inflammation-related changes in adipokine gene
expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Resveratrol suppressed extracellular
receptor-activated kinase (ERK) and transcription factor-kappa B
(NF-kappa B) activation by reducing the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and
NF-kappa B p65: moreover, it modulated insulin signaling transduction
by modification of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS-1) and downstream AKT (T308), and thereby improved
insulin sensitivity in adiposities. These results demonstrated that
resveratrol modulated adipokines expression and improved insulin
sensitivity which relative to inhibition of inflammatory-like response
in adipocytes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Preparation and In Vitro Evaluation of Povidone-Sodium
Cholate-Phospholipid Mixed Micelles for the Solubilization of Poorly
Soluble Drugs
SO ARCHIVES OF PHARMACAL RESEARCH
AB Mixed micelles made of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), sodium cholate, and
phospholipids were prepared to improve the solubility of poorly
water-soluble drugs. Sylibin, a drug used in treating liver diseases,
was incorporated into the mixed micelles. The formulation of sylibin
containing PVP-sodium cholate-phospholipid mixed micelles with an
optimized composition (PVP/sodium cholate/phospholipid/silybin =
3:3:4:1 similar to 2 by weight) was obtained based on the study of
pseudoternary phase diagrams. The critical micelle concentration was
used to evaluate the micellar stability towards dilution. The results
showed that addition of PVP to sodium-cholate-phospholipid mixed
micelles increased stability. The solubility of sylibin in PVP-sodium
cholate-phospholipid mixed micelles was higher than that in pure water
or in sodium cholate-phospholipid mixed micelles. In a stability study,
we found that PVP-sodium cholate-phospholipid mixed micelles showed
good stability. After 3 months storage at 40 degrees C, just 2.6%
sylibin was lost with only minor changes of the particle size when
compared to a reference formulation containing sodium cholate and
phospholipid mixed micelles. In addition, the developed formulation
significantly improved in vitro drug release. The time required to
release 50% sylibin (t50%) from sodium cholate and phospholipid mixed
micelles was 326 h, while the t50% from PVP-sodium cholate-phospholipid
mixed micelles was only 51.1 h. Our results suggest that these mixed
micelles might have significant potential application to the
biomedical field.

TI Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Detection For DNA Arrays Based on
Silver Nanoparticle Aggregates
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Multiplexed DNA target detection is of great significance in many
fields including clinical diagnostics, environmental monitoring,
biothreat detection and forensics. Although the emergence of DNA chip
technology has accelerated this process, it is still a challenge to
perform ultrasensitive DNA assay at low attomol concentrations so that
DNA detection can be directly achieved without a PCR protocol. In this
work, an oligonucleotide-functionalized silver nanoparticle tag has
been successfully developed for multiplexed DNA electrochemical
detection with ultrahigh sensitivity. The multiprobes containing
oligo(d)A and the reporting probes were anchored onto the silver
nanopartides, followed by hybridizing with the silver nanoparticle
conjugate modified with oligo(d)T. The-hybridization-induced tag was
found to show an aggregated nanostructare 10 times larger than the
individual nanoparticle, as revealed by TEM. For sandwich-based
assays, the tag was specifically coupled to a gold electrode surface
via target DNA. Compared to a single nanoparticle label, this novel
tag has shown excellent electroactive property and produces 10(3)-fold
amplification in the differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) method.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) sequence was employed as a sample model, and
we have achieved a detection limit of 5 aM (similar to 120 molecules
in 40 mu L volume), demonstrating ultrasensitive measurement for DNA.
The property of the electrochemical process involving silver
aggregates was further investigated and the integrative oxidation of
the silver tag was observed. We further demonstrated the multiplexed
DNA target detection using array chips functionalized with Herpes
simplex virus (HSV), Epstein Barr-virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus
(CMV) sequences, which shows effective recognition of the relative
sequences individually or simultaneously. The method offers a uniquely
new approach for DNA detection with ultrahigh sensitivity as well as
advantages of rapidity, throughput, and miniaturization.

TI Toxicities of aristolochic acid I and aristololactam I in cultured
renal epithelial cells
SO TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO
AB Aristolochic acid nephropathy, a progressive tubulointerstitial renal
disease, is primarily caused by aristolochic acid I (AA-I)
intoxication. Aristololactam I (AL-I), the main metabolite of AA-I,
may also participate in the processes that lead to renal damage. To
investigate the role and mechanism of the AL-I-mediated cytotoxicity,
we determined and compared the cytotoxic effects of AA-I and AL-I on
cells of the human proximal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cell line. To
this end, we treated HK-2 cells with AA-I and AL-I and assessed the
cytotoxicity of these agents by using the
3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MU)
assay, flow cytometry, and an assay to determine the activity of caspase
3. The proliferation of HK-2 cells was inhibited in a concentrationand time-dependent manner. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that the cells
were arrested in the S-phase. Apoptosis was evidenced by the results
of the annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assay and the occurrence of a
sub-G1 peak. In addition, AA-I and AL-I increased caspase 3-like
activity in a concentration-dependent manner. These results also
suggested that the cytotoxic potency of AL-I is higher than that of
AA-I and that the cytotoxic effects of these molecules are mediated
through the induction of apoptosis in a caspase 3-dependent pathway.

TI S-thanatin enhances the efficacy of tigecycline in an experimental rat
model of polymicrobial peritonitis
SO PEPTIDES
AB We investigated the efficacy of the peptide s-thanatin alone and in
combination with tigecycline in an animal model of sepsis induced by
cecal ligation and puncture. Adult male Wistar rats were randomized
to receive intravenously isotonic sodium chloride solution, 5 mg/kg
s-thanatin, 2 mg/kg tigecycline, 5 mg/kg s-thanatin combined with 2
mg/kg tigecycline. The experiment was also performed with
administration of the drugs 360 min after the surgical procedure to
better investigate the clinical situation where there is an interval
between the onset of sepsis and the initiation of therapy. Lethality,
bacterial growth in blood, peritoneum, spleen and liver, and NO indices
were evaluated. All compounds reduced the lethality when compared to
control. In all experiments, the compounds reduced significantly
bacterial growth and lethality compared with saline treatment.
Treatment with s-thanatin resulted in significant decrease in plasma
NO levels compared to tigecycline and control group. The combination
between s-thanatin and tigecycline proved to be the most effective
treatment in reducing all variables measured. S-thanatin may have
potential therapeutic usefulness alone and when associated to
tigecycline in polymicrobial peritonitis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

TI Study on fluorescence properties of carbogenic nanoparticles and their
application for the determination of ferrous succinate
SO JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE
AB A new type of fluorescent nanomaterial named carbogenic nanoparticles
(NPs) has drawn considerable attention recently. In this study, we
adopted a direct and simple synthetic method to produce the carbogenic
NPs and investigated the fluorescence properties of the as-prepared
carbogenic NPs in detail. It was found that the fluorescence of
carbogenic NPs was stable with the variance of environmental conditions
such as pH, temperature and UV irradiation. More interestingly, we
found carbogenic NPs exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity
towards ferric ions. Under optimum conditions, a good linear
relationship could be obtained between the fluorescence intensity and
concentration of ferric ions in the range of 5.0 x 10(-5)-5.0 x 10(-4)
mol L-1, and the limit of detection is 11.21 mu mol L-1. Based on the
fluorescence quenching of carbogenic NPs, a rapid and specific
quantitative method was proposed for the determination of ferrous
succinate. The content of ferrous succinate in commercial tablets
determined by the present method was agreed with the spectrophotometric
method results and the reproducibility and the recovery of the proposed
method were satisfactory. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Development of a Size-Exclusion HPLC Method with Evaporative
Light-Scattering Detection for the Quantitation of Polysorbate 80 in
Houttuynia cordata Injection
SO JOURNAL OF AOAC INTERNATIONAL
AB A rapid and accurate size-exclusion HPLC method for the quantitation
of polysorbate 80 (PS80) in Houttuynia cordata injection, a Chinese
traditional medicine, was developed and validated. The assay was
conducted on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a TosoHaas TSKgel G2000
SWXL column (30 cm x 7.8 mm, 5 mu m particle size) and an Alltech
evaporative light-scattering detector (ELSD) 2000. The mobile phase
was 20 mmoL/L ammonium acetate-acetonitrile (90 + 10, v/v) delivered
at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min under isocratic conditions. The ELSD was
operated in the impactor "off" mode, the drift tube temperature was
set at 110 degrees C, and nitrogen flow was maintained at 2.3 L/min.
The LOD was 0.25 mg/mL. Linearity was obtained between the log of
concentration (C) and the log of peak area (Y) of PS80 in the range
of 0.5-20 mg/mL according to the equation: Log Y = 1.4529 Log C 0.8232
(r(2) = 0.9976). An RSD of 1.6% (n = 6) for the determination
demonstrated the good precision of the optimized method. PS80 content
in several commercial H. cordata injection products from different
manufacturers was determined. The data for PS80 content is useful in
evaluation of the safety of the products from different manufacturers.

TI Preparation and pharmacodynamics of stearic acid and poly
(lactic-co-glycolic acid) grafted chitosan oligosaccharide micelles
for 10-hydroxycamptothecin
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
AB Stearic acid (SA) and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) grafted
chitosan oligosaccharide (SA-CSO-PLGA SCP) tripolymer was synthesized
via the reaction between the carboxyl group of SA or PLGA with
carboxylic side group, and the amine group of CSO in the presence of
1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). The degrees of
amino-substitution for SA and PLGA were assayed through 2, 4,
6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) test and C-13 NMR spectrum,
which were 8.15% and 5.82%, respectively; the critical micelle
concentrations of SCP in PBS (pH 7.4) and deionized water (DI water)
were about 34.9 and 14.5 mu g/ml, respectively. Using
10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) as a model drug, the drug-loaded
micelles showed above 86% encapsulation efficiency, which not only
enhanced the solubility of HCFT in aqueous medium markedly, but also
protected the lactone ring of HCPT. Cellular uptakes of SCP micelles
against A549, MCF-7 and HepG-2 tumor cells showed a faster cellular
internalization. Comparing to the commercial HCFT injection,
HCPT-loaded micelles showed higher cytotoxicities against A549, MCF-7
and HepG-2 cells. The increased folds were 22, 18 and 15, respectively.
These results suggested the SCP could be applied as a carrier for
hydrophobic drugs. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI LC-ESI-MS-MS Determination of Rat Plasma Protein Binding of Major
Flavonoids of Flos Lonicerae Japonicae by Centrifugal Ultrafiltration
SO CHROMATOGRAPHIA
AB Centrifugal ultrafiltration (CU) and a fast liquid chromatography with
electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS-MS)
method have been developed for drug-protein binding analysis of four
flavonoids of Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (FLJ). A rapid separation of
free drug from the plasma was achieved by CU and the simultaneous
analysis of four flavonoids of FLJ in rat plasma was by fast
LC-ESI-MS-MS. The chromatographic analytical time decreased to 6.5 min
without sacrificing resolution using a 4.6 mm x 50 mm, 1.8 mu m particle
size reverse phase column and MS-MS mode performed for multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM). The protein binding rates of four flavonoids
were in the range of 66.8 +/- A 7.4 to 81.3 +/- A 5.1% after oral
administration of the flavonoid fraction of FLJ. All values were almost
similar to 70.0% at 30, 45 and 80 min. Its result suggests that these
flavonoids in rat plasma perform high protein binding rates and present
a stable binding in a longer time. Meanwhile, it reveals that the
elimination of these flavonoids may be relatively moderate in the body,
the performance of a certain degree of accumulation may be speculated
and make further impacts on the pharmacokinetic parameters.

TI Absorption of CO2 in the aqueous solutions of functionalized ionic
liquids and MDEA
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Four ionic liquids (ILs) tetramethylammonium glycinate (=[Gly]),
tetraethylammonium glycinate ([N-2222][Gly])), tetramethylammonium
lysinate ([N-1111][Lys]) and tetraethylammonium lysinate
([N-2222][Lys]) were synthesized and mixed with water or
N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) aqueous solutions to form a new type of
solvents for the uptake of CO2. The solubility or absorption of CO2
in these IL+MDEA aqueous solutions was investigated over a wide range
of IL concentrations (5-100%), temperature (298-318 K) and partial
pressure of CO2 (4-400 kPa). The results indicated that ionic liquid
could greatly enhance the absorption and increased the absorption rate
of CO2 in MDEA aqueous solutions. It had been found that the aqueous
solutions of 15% IL and 15% MDEA had higher absorption rate and larger
uptake than other IL+MDEA solutions of 30% total amines. Temperature
(298-318 K) seemed to have some influence on the absorption of CO2 in
IL+MDEA aqueous solutions. Noticeably, due to the two amino groups in
a molecular, the mole absorption of the 30% lysine based ionic liquids
aqueous solutions was 0.98 ([N-1111][Lys]) and 1.21 ([N-2222][Lys])
mole CO2, being about 2-3 times the absorption capacity of MDEA under
the same condition. Regeneration under the condition of temperature
353 K. 4 kPa for 240 min showed that aqueous solution of 15% IN, 15%
MDEA had significant regeneration efficiency (over 98%). (c) 2010

TI Bioactivity and pharmacokinetics of two human serum albumin-thymosin
alpha 1-fusion proteins, rHSA-T alpha 1 and rHSA-L-T alpha 1, expressed
in recombinant Pichia pastoris
SO CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
AB Thymosin-alpha 1 (T alpha 1) is indicated for the treatment of certain
viral infections, including hepatitis B and C, and cancers, such as
melanoma. In this paper, the fusion genes encoding human serum albumin
(HSA) and T alpha 1 with (rHSA-L-T alpha 1) and without a linker peptide
(rHSA-T alpha 1) were constructed and overexpressed in P. pastoris.
Through the process of ion interaction chromatography (Q-Sepharose
F.F), hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Phenyl Sepharose HP) and
affinity chromatography (Blue Sepharose F.F), the purity of fusion
proteins was greater than 97%. In contrast to the reactivity of normal
spleen cells to Con A, the data of in vitro murine spleen lymphocytes
proliferation experiment suggested that spleen cells achieved a higher
degree of T cell maturation after rHSA-L-T alpha 1, rHSA-T alpha 1 and
T alpha 1 treatments, respectively. Moreover, rHSA-L-T alpha 1, rHSA-T
alpha 1 and T alpha 1 can also antagonize dexamethasone-induced
apoptosis of thymocyte sub-populations. In hydrocortisone-induced
immunosuppression mice (in vivo experiments), after subcutaneous
injections with two fusion proteins and T alpha 1 for seven consecutive
days, the net increment of body weight, the spleen index and the thymus
index were significantly improved. Simultaneously, the increase in SOD
level and the decrease in MDA level in plasma were observed. The
pharmacokinetic data of rHSA-L-T alpha 1 and rHSA-T alpha 1
administered in rats showed an improved pharmacokinetic profile with
a conspicuous prolonged half life. The analysis of bioactivity and
pharmacokinetics suggested that fusion proteins rHSA-L-T alpha 1 and
rHSA-T alpha 1 were new drug candidates.

TI Telmisartan alleviates rosiglitazone-induced bone loss in
ovariectomized spontaneous hypertensive rats
SO BONE
AB In the present study, we systematically examined telmisartan, an
angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist, on rosiglitazone-induced bone
loss in ovariectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats. Telmisartan
(5 mg/kg/d, 90 days) was found to be able to significantly alleviate
rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg/d, 90 days)-induced decrease in BMD of femur
and lumbar vertebrae. The BMD changes were associated with positive
biomechanical changes of lumbar vertebrae, improvements in
microarchitecture of tibial metaphysic and normalized serum
osteocalcin (OC) levels and urinary deoxypyridinoline/creatinine
(DPD/Cr) ratio. MicroCT analysis of the tibial metaphysis showed that
telmisartan significantly prevented the decreases in bone
volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), connect density (Conn. D.), trabecular
number (Tb. N.) and trabecular thickness (Tb. Th.), and increase in
trabecular separation (Tb. Sp.) induced by rosiglitazone.
Histomorphometric analysis also showed that telmisartan had protective
effects on rosiglitazone-reduced bone formation indices such as
histomorphometric bone volume fraction (BV/TV-Histo), mineralizing
surface/bone surface (MS/BS), mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone
formation rate (BFR/BS). Our study clearly showed that telmisartan
alleviated rosiglitazone-induced bone loss in ovariectomized
spontaneous hypertensive rats. The relief of bone loss provides a
possible therapeutic application of telmisartan with rosiglitazone for
the treatment of elderly women patients afflicted with metabolic
syndrome. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The Saponin Monomer of Dwarf Lilyturf Tuber, DT-13, Reduces Human
Breast Cancer Cell Adhesion and Migration during Hypoxia via Regulation
of Tissue Factor
SO BIOLOGICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB Adhesion and migration of tumor cells are crucial steps in tumor
invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we investigated the
effects of saponin monomer 13 of dwarf lilyturf tuber (DT-13) on
metastasis of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-435) during hypoxia.
The effects and molecular mechanisms of DT-13 on MDA-MB-435 cells
metastatic phenotype in vitro and in vivo were evaluated by RNA
interference; quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) and Western blot assays. DT-13 had no significant effects
on cell adhesion and migration under normoxia conditions. Under hypoxic
conditions, IVIDA-MB-435 adhesion to vitronectin was inhibited by
about 43.5% or 60.8% after exposure of the cells to DT-13 at 1 mu M
or 10 mu M, respectively. DT-13 decreased the migratory response by
hypoxia at 1 or 10 mu M, and inhibition ratios were 20% and 30%,
respectively. DT-13 inhibited hypoxia-induced expression of alpha v
beta 3 integrin, tissue factor (TF) and early growth response gene-1
(Egr-1) and decreased excretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)
of MDA-MB-435 cells under hypoxic conditions. After Egr-1 short
interference RNA (siRNA) treatment, DT-13 could still inhibit the
up-regulation of TF mRNA and protein levels and its pro-coagulant
activity (PCA) under hypoxia. In nude mice, DT-13 decreased
extravasation of MDA-MB-435 cells in the lung after tail vein
injection. Our data suggest that DT-13 inhibits MDA-MB-435 cells
metastasis during hypoxia via regulation of TF, and the effect of DT-13
on TF is partly mediated by Egr-1.

TI Testis dysfunction by isoproterenol is mediated by upregulating
endothelin receptor A, leptin and protein kinase C epsilon and is
attenuated by an endothelin receptor antagonist CPU0213
SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY
AB This study has examined whether upregulation of endothelin receptor
A, leptin and phosphorylated protein kinase C epsilon contributes to
stress-induced testicular damaged and its possible reversal by
endothelial (ET) antagonism. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were
randomly divided into control and isoproterenol (ISO 1 mg/kg,
subcutaneous (s.c.), 10 days) groups, and intervened with the ET
receptor antagonist CPU0213 (20 mg/kg, s.c.), on days 6-10. In ISO
group, testicular succinate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase,
acid phosphotase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and serum
testosterone decreased, whereas FSH increased, relative to control.
The seminiferous tubules were damaged in association with testicular
upregulation of protein abundance of leptin and pPKC epsilon, and mRNA
and protein expression of leptin receptor (OBRb) and ETA. CPU0213 was
effective in ameliorating these abnormalities. Over-expression of ETA
and leptin accounting for the testis dysfunction is likely to be
mediated by pPKC epsilon in the ISO treated rats. The upregulated ET
pathway appears to be critical in pathologies of the testis. (C) 2010

TI Influence of segmental and selected ion monitoring on quantitation of
multi-component using high-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole
mass spectrometry: Simultaneous detection of 16 saponins in rat plasma
as a case
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB Quadrupole (Q) mass spectrometers are the most popular analytical tools
due to their reliability, effectiveness, and low cost. However, they
are not suitable for quantitative analysis of multi-component since
the sensitivity will get worse rapidly with the increasing number of
m/z detected. The present work, for the first time, attempted to analyze
of 16 saponins simultaneously using an approach of segmental and
selected ion monitoring (SSIM) based on LC-Q/MS, and systematically
investigated the influence of different SSIM modes on signal
level/noise level (S/N), lower limits of quantification (LLOQ), upper
limits of quantification (ULOQs), etc. Our results showed that a proper
SSIM mode could not only provide much higher sensitivity for all the
targeting analytes, but also dramatically broadened their dynamic
ranges. The developed methodology could effectively break the
application bottleneck on the quantitative analysis of multi-component
with LC-Q/MS, and would be applied widely in related fields for
multi-component analysis, such as environmental monitoring,
metabonomics, Chinese herbal medicine research. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI Hybrid cells differentiate to hepatic lineage cells and repair
oxidative damage
SO CELLULAR & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LETTERS
AB Hybrid cells derived from stem cells play an important role in
organogenesis, tissue regeneration and cancer formation. However, the
fate of hybrid cells and their range of function are poorly understood.
Fusing stem cells and somatic cells induces somatic cell reprogramming,
and the resulting hybrid cells are embryonic stem cell-like cells.
Therefore, we hypothesize that fusion-induced hybrid cells may behave
like ES cells in certain microenvironments. In this study, human
hepatic cells were induced to apoptosis with H2O2, and then co-cultured
with hybrid cells that had been derived from mouse ES cells and human
hepatic cells using a transwell. After co-culturing, the degree of
apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin-V/PI double-staining analysis,
flow cytometry and Western-blot. We observed that H2O2-induced cell
apoptosis was inhibited by co-culture. In addition, the activity of
injury-related enzymes (GSH-Px, LDH and SOD) and the level of albumin
release in the co-culture system trended toward the level of normal
undamaged hepatic cells. The stably increased levels of secretion of
ALB in the co-culture system also confirmed that co-culture with hybrid
cells helped in recovery from injury. The fate of the hybrid cells was
studied by analyzing their gene expression and protein expression
profiles. The results of RT-PCR indicated that during co-culturing,
like ES cells, hybrid cells differentiated into hepatic lineage cells.
Hybrid cells transcripted genes from both parental cell genomes. Via
immunocytochemical analysis, hepatic directional differentiation of
the hybrid cells was also confirmed. After injecting the hybrid cells
into the mouse liver, the GFP-labeled transplanted cells were
distributed in the hepatic lobules and engrafted into the liver
structure. This research expands the knowledge of fusion-related
events and the possible function of hybrid cells. Moreover, it could
indicate a new route of differentiation from pluripotent cells to
tissue-specific cells via conditional co-culture.

TI Overexpression of aveBIV leading to the improvement of
4'-epidaunorubicin production in Streptomyces coeruleorubidus strain
SIPI-A0707
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The 4'-epidaunorubicin is the semisynthesis precursor of epirubicin
which is a clinically useful antitumor drug thought to have slightly
less cardiotoxicity than doxorubin. The 4'-epidaunorubicin was formed
by overexpression of heterologous Streptomyces avermitilis aveBIV in
Streptomyces coeruleorubidus SIPI-A0707 dnmV mutant blocked in the
biosynthesis of daunosamine, the deoxysugar component of daunorubicin.
But there was a low-yield production of 4'-epidaunorubicin. In our
study, product yields were enhanced considerably by increasing aveBIV
gene copy number or changing means of aveBIV integration. The
4'-epidaunorubicin titer was improved by around threefold in the
recombinant strain DYG1006 with the aveBIV increased threefold copy
numbers. The transcript levels of aveBIV gene meet the expectation of
fermentation levels of 4'-epidaunorubicin. The method described here
provides the means to produce 4'-epidaunorubicin efficiently on an
industrial scale.

TI Preparation, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of
Liposomes Containing Brucea javanica Oil
SO AAPS PHARMSCITECH
AB Brucea javanica oil-loaded liposomes (BJOL) were prepared through thin
film hydration method and characterized by transmission electron
microscope, dynamic light scattering, and differential scanning
calorimetry. Acute toxicity of B. javanica oil (BJO) in liposomes was
assessed by determining the number of deaths of Kunming mice over
intravenous treatment for 2 weeks. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the
main active component (oleic acid) was studied in SD rats. The
pharmacodynamics of BJOL was investigated using MMC-7721 cell lines
and mice with Lewis lung cancer. The commercial emulsion of BJO (BJOE)
was used as a reference. The data showed that BJOL had an average
diameter of 108.2 nm with a zeta potential of -57.0 mV, drug loading
of 3.60%, and entrapment efficiency of 92.40%. The area under curve
of BJO in liposomes and emulsions were 2.31 and 1.15 mg min/ml,
respectively. Compared with BJOE, mean residence time and elimination
half-time (t (1/2)) increased 2.8- and 4.0-fold, respectively, and the
clearance (CL) decreased 0.5-fold. In the acute toxicity test, the
median lethal dose (LD50) of BJOE was 7.35 g/kg. In contrast, all mice
treated with liposomes survived even at the highest dosage (12.70
g/kg). The IC50 value of BJOL group was one third of that of BJOE group
(p < 0.01), and a less weight loss was observed in the BJOL-treated
animals (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the present study suggests that BJOL
significantly decreased toxicity of BJO and enhance the antitumor
activity. Therefore, liposomes may be a potential effective delivery
vehicle for this lipophilic antitumor drug.

TI Pharmacological evaluation of Alstonia scholaris: Anti-inflammatory
and analgesic effects
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Alstonia scholaris (Apocynaceae) has
been historically used in "dai" ethnopharmacy to treat chronic
respiratory diseases. The leaf extract, developed as a commercially
available traditional Chinese medicine, used to release tracheitis and
cold symptom, has also been prescribed in hospitals and sold over the
counter in drug stores.
Aim of the study: The investigation evaluated the anti-inflammatory
and analgesic activities of the ethanolic extract, fractions and main
alkaloids of Alstonia scholaris leaf to provide experimental evidence
for its traditional and modern clinical use. Besides, to discover the
active fraction and components for further better use in Chinese
medicine is hopeful.
Materials and methods: The leaf of Alstonia scholaris was extracted
with ethanol and then separated into different fractions. Furthermore,
alkaloids were isolated by phytochemical method. The analgesic
activities were investigated using acetic acid-induced writhing,
hot-plate and formalin tests in mice. The anti-inflammatory activities
were carried out in vivo and in vitro, including xylene-induced ear
edema and carrageenan-induced air pouch formation in mice, and COX-1,
-2 and 5-LOX inhibition.
Results: It has been exhibited that the EtOAc and alkaloid fractions
reduced acetic acid-induced writhing response in mice, significantly.
The ethanolic extract, Et0Ac and alkaloid fractions remarkably
inhibited xylene-induced ear edema. Further investigation was focused
on the alkaloids fraction and three main alkaloids isolated from the
alkaloids fraction, in different animal models. Alkaloids reduced
acetic acid-induced writhing response, and xylene-induced ear edema
in mice. In the hot-plate test, alkaloids did not increase the latency
period of mice obviously. In the formalin test, alkaloids did not
inhibit the licking time in first phase, but significantly inhibited
the licking time in second phase of mice. Alkaloids increased
significantly SOD activity and decreased levels of NO. PGE2 and MDA
significantly, in air pouch mice model. Moreover, some alkaloids
isolated from the leaf of Alstonia scholaris exhibited inhibition of
COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX in vitro anti-inflammatory assay, which
supported alkaloids as the bioactive fraction.
Conclusions: The alkaloids fraction of Alstonia scholaris leaf, three
main alkaloids, picrinine, vallesamine and scholaricine, may produce
the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect peripherally based on
several in vivo assays. In in vitro tests, alkaloids exhibited
inhibition of inflammatory mediators (COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX), which
is accordant with results on animal models. Besides, COX-2/5-LOX dual
inhibitors found in the experiment, such as 16-formyl-5
alpha-methoxystrictamine, picralinal, and tubotaiwine might be
valuable for further attention. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ireland

molecular weight of 788 kDa and a hydroxypropyl content of 12.05%. H-GLP
also had an excellent water solubility of more than 50 mg/mL, suggesting
that hydroxypropylation might serve as an effective approach to enhance
water solubility of GLP. H-GLP was also compared to the original GLP
and ascorbic acid for antioxidant properties. H-GLP showed much
stronger free radical scavenging capacity against hydroxyl and
superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide than GLP. These results
suggested the potential of hydroxypropylation in developing
water-soluble antioxidative polysaccharides from GLP to enhance the
profitability of G. lucidium production and processing industries. (C)

TI Extracting human gait series based on the wavelet transform
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The wavelet transform was applied to process the accelerometer signals
derived from human walking. The accelerometer signals were first
decomposed at different levels utilizing the multi-scale and
multi-resolution characteristics of the discrete wavelet transform
After the determination of both the mother wavelet and the optimal
decomposition level, human gait series can thus be extracted from the
eigen scale of the accelerometer signal Compared with the method that
detects peak values directly from accelerometer signals by
thresholding, the wavelet transform gives higher detection rate of peak
values on the eigen scale of the accelerometer signals Even when the
accelerometer signals are exposed to serious noise, experimental
results still demonstrate that the wavelet approach can guarantee the
precision of the extracted gait series, which is of vital importance
for the subsequent analyses It can be concluded that wavelet transform
is an effective tool for the extraction of gait rhythmicity. The wavelet
transform will be helpful in identifying the characteristics of other
physiological signals.

TI Development of a Novel Self-Microemulsifying Drug Delivery System for
Reducing HIV Protease Inhibitor-Induced Intestinal Epithelial Barrier
Dysfunction
SO MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS
AB The development of HIV protease inhibitors (Pis) has been one of the
most significant advances of the past decade in controlling HIV
infection. Unfortunately, the benefits of HIV Pis are compromised by
serious side effects. One of the most frequent and deleterious side
effects of HIV Pls is severe gastrointestinal (GI) disorders including
mucosal erosions, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and leak-flux
diarrhea, which occurs in 16-62% of patients on HIV Pls. Although the
underlying mechanisms behind HIV Pl-associated serious adverse side
effects remain to be identified, our recent studies have shown that
activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response plays a
critical role in HIV Pl-induced GI complications. The objective of this
study was to develop a novel self-microemulsifying drug delivery system
(SMEDDS) using various antioxidants as surfactants and cosurfactants
to reduce the GI side effects of the most commonly used HIV PI,
ritonavir. The biological activities of this SMSDDS of ritonavir were
compared with that of Norvir, which is currently used in the clinic.
Rat normal intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) and mouse Raw 264.7
macrophages were used to examine the effect of new SMEDDS of ritonavir
on activation of ER stress and oxidative stress. Sprague-Dawley rats
and C571BL6 mice were used for pharmacokinetic studies and in vivo
studies. The intracellular and plasma drug concentrations were
determined by HPLC analysis. Activation of ER stress was detected by
Western blot analysis and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP)
reporter assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate as a probe. Cell viability was
determined by Roche's cell proliferation reagent WST-1. Protein levels
of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) were determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The intestinal
permeability was assessed by luminal enteral administration of
fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated dextran (FITC-dextran, 4 kDa).
The pathologic changes in intestine were determined by histological
examination. The results indicated that incorporation of antioxidants
in this new SMEDDS not only significantly reduced ritonavir-induced
ER stress activation, ROS production and apoptosis in intestinal
epithelial cells and macrophages, but also improved the solubility,
stability and bioavailability of ritonavir, and significantly reduced
ritonavir-induced disruption of intestinal barrier function in vivo.
In conclusion, this new SMEDDS of ritonavir has less GI side effects
compared to Norvir. This new SMEDDS can be used for other HIV Pls and
any insoluble antiviral drug with serious GI side effects.

AB The field of ionic liquid has gained rapid growth in recent years and
occupied a forefront in green chemistry. As a useful instrument to the
research and development of novel ionic liquids, the physical
properties are of utmost importance. Thus, great efforts have been made
to obtain these important data, as it is far from getting sufficient
physiochemical information for intensive and extensive investigation
which consequently becomes a bottleneck for the theoretical and
applicable research of ionic liquids. Additionally, with the given
immeasurable possible ionic liquids by various cation and anion
combinations, it is an impossible task to find an ideal ionic liquid
with desired physical properties using conventionally "try and error"
process. For these reasons, exploration of novel prediction models for
physical properties of ionic liquid is imperative. This paper gives
an overview of recent progress of various prediction models.

TI Modified Si-Miao-San extract inhibits the release of inflammatory
mediators from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophages
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Modified Si-Miao-San (mSMS) is a
prescription modified from Si-Miao-San which is an ancient Chinese
prescription used to treat various ailments.
Aim of the study: Modified Si-Miao-San (mSMS) has been used for the
treatment of infectious and inflammatory disorders in the clinic. This
study was aimed to investigate its anti-inflammatory activity and
underlying mechanism at cellular and molecular levels.
Materials and methods: We stimulated RAW264.7 cells with
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and observed effects of mSMS on the release
of inflammatory mediators such as: tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), NO, and relative gene expressions.
Meanwhile, we also investigated the modulation of mSMS in inflammatory
signal transduction mediated through extracellular signal-regulated
protein kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway.
Results: Our findings demonstrated that mSMS significantly inhibited
the excessive production of NO, TNF-alpha and IL-6 and the over
expression of relative genes in LPS-stimulated macrophages. In
addition, mSMS suppressed LPS-induced ERK1/2-phosphorylation and
inhibited the activation of NF-kappa B by attenuation of I kappa B-alpha
degradation.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties
of mSMS might result from the inhibition of inflammatory mediators,
such as NO, TNF-alpha and IL-6, via suppression of ERK and NF-kappa
B dependent pathways. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
AB Stearic acid (SA) grafted chitosan oligosaccharide (CSO-SA) with
different molecular weight of chitosan oligosaccharide (CSO) and graft
ratio of stearic acid were synthesized by coupling reaction of SA and
CSO. The cationic polymeric micelles of CSO-SA via self-assemble formed
and used for gene delivery of fish sperm DNA. Factors affecting
complexation and stability of the complexes of CSO-SA micelles and DNA
were investigated. The results indicated that pKa of CSO-SA with 3 kDa
of CSO decreased from 8.16 to 6.02 as the substitution degree of amino
groups of CSO in CSO-SA increased from 9.79% to 63.41%, whereas the
molecular weight (M-W) of CSO less affected the pKa. As for the
stability of complexes, ethidium bromide assay data demonstrated that
the complexes consisting of CSO-SA with lower amino substitution degree
or smaller molecular weight of CSO were more stable than that with the
higher amino substitution degree or molecular weight of CSO. The
results also presented that the low pH and ionic strength environment
were in favor for the stability of complexes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI Nanostructured lipid carriers constituted from high-density
lipoprotein components for delivery of a lipophilic cardiovascular
drug
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
AB To investigate the possibility of reconstituted protein-free
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) being a carrier for delivering a
lipophilic cardiovascular drug, Tanshinone IIA-loaded HDL-like
nanostructured lipid carriers (TA-NLC) were prepared by a
nanoprecipitation/solvent diffusion method. The physicochemical
parameters of TA-NLC were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta
potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency, differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) and stability. A novel two-step method has been
employed to determine entrapment efficiency of TA-NLC. The binding
properties of TA-NLC to apolipoproteins were investigated by in vitro
incubation competition assay in the presence of native HDL and
electrophoresis test. Phagocytosis and cytotoxicity was evaluated
using mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 with TA-NLC and incubated
TA-NLC with native HDL (TA-NLC-apo). The results showed that TA-NLC
had an average diameter of 8.0 +/- 1.2 nm, zeta potential of -29.0 +/0.0 mV, drug loading of 6.17 +/- 0.3% and entrapment efficiency of 97.84
+/- 1.2%. TA-NLC were demonstrated spheres with drug incorporated in
lipid core forming a shell-core structure. DSC analysis showed that
TA was dispersed in NLC in an amorphous state. The incorporation of
glycerol trioleate to NLC led to crystal order disturbance. Agarose
gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-SPAGE) patterns indicated that TA-NLC could bind
to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) specifically in vitro. Phagocytosis
studies showed significant differences in uptake between TA-NLC and
TA-NLC-apo and demonstrated that TA-NLC incubated with native HDL could
turn endogenous by association to apolipoproteins, which cannot
trigger immunological responses and could escape from recognition by
macrophages. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Protective effect of C-phycocyanin against carbon
tetrachloride-induced hepatocyte damage in vitro and in vivo
SO CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS
AB This study focused on the hepatoprotective activity of C-phycocyanin
(C-PC) against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatocyre damage in vitro
and in vivo. In in vitro study, human hepatocyte cell line L02 was used.
C-PC showed its capability to reverse CCl4-induced L02 cells viability
loss, alanine transaminase (ALT) leakage and morphological changes.
C-PC also showed the following positive effects: prevent the
CCl4-induced overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA); prevent changes in superoxide
dismutase (SOD) activity; and reduce glutathione (GSH) level. In vivo,
CPC showed its capability to decrease serum ALT and aspartate
transaminase (AST) levels in CCl4-induced liver damage in mice. The
histological observations supported the results obtained from serum
enzymes assays. C-PC also showed the following effects in mice liver:
prevent the CCl4-induced MDA formation and GSH depletion; prevent SOD
and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity; and prevent the
elevation of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta(1)) and
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mRNAs. Both the in vitro and in vivo
results suggested that C-PC was useful in protecting against
CCl4-induced hepatocyte damage. One of the mechanisms is believed to
be through C-PCs scavenging ability to protect the hepatocytes from
free radicals damage induced by CCl4. In addition, C-PC may be able
to block inflammatory infiltration through its anti-inflammatory
activities by inhibiting TGF-beta 1 and HGF expression. (C) 2010

SO ARZNEIMITTEL-FORSCHUNG-DRUG RESEARCH
AB A rapid, simple and sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid
chromatographic-tandem mass/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) method has
been developed for the measurement of rabeprazole (CAS 117976-89-3)
concentrations in human plasma and its use in bioavailability studies
has been evaluated. The method was linear in the concentration range
of 0.05-2.5 mu g/ml. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.05
mu g/ml in 1 ml plasma sample. The intra- and inter-day relative
standard deviation across three validation runs over the entire
concentration range was less than 8.2% and 7.53%, respectively. This
method was successfully applied for the evaluation of pharmacokinetic
profiles of rabeprazole tablet in 18 healthy volunteers. The main
pharmacokinetic parameters obtained were: AUC(0-t) 1415.88 +/- 505.46
and 1457.44 +/- 524.40 ng . h/ml, AUC(0-infinity) 1439.10 +/- 507.47
and 1479.81 +/- 527.83 ng h/ml, C-max 678.24 +/- 278.93 and 657.83 +/250.86 ng/ml, t(1/2) 1.48 +/- 0.19 and 1.38 +/- 0.24 h, t(max) 3.8 +/0.8 and 3.7 +/- 0.5 h for the test and reference formulations,
respectively. No statistical differences were observed for C-max and
the area under the plasma concentration time curve for rabeprazole.
90% confidence limits calculated for C-max and AUC from zero to infinity
(AUC(0-infinity)) of rabeprazole were included in the bioequivalence
range (0.8-1.25 for AUC).

sodium cholate and phospholipid for oral administration of silybin,
a promising hepatoprotectants.
Methods: The optimum formulation of sodium cholate/phospholipid-mixed
micelles containing silybin was obtained based on the study of
pseudo-ternary phase diagram. The dissolution of silybin-mixed
micelles was investigated. The pharmacokinetic characteristics and
bioavailability after oral administration of silybin-mixed micelles
and silybin-N-methylglucamine were compared in dogs.
Results: The mean particle size of prepared mixed micelles was 75.9
+/- 4.2 nm. The largest solubility of silybin was found to be 10.0 +/1.1 mg/mL in the optimum formulation of mixed micelles. The
silybin-sodium cholate/phospholipid-mixed micelles showed a very slow
release of silybin 17.5% (w/w) within 72 h in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)
and 15.6% (w/w) in HCl solution (pH 1.2). After oral administration
to dogs, the relative bioavailability of mixed micelles versus
silybin-N-methylglucamine in dogs was 252.0%.
Conclusion: Sodium cholate/phospholipid-mixed micelles are promising
carriers in orally delivery of silybin, considering their capability
of enhancing bioavailability and large-scale production.

TI The Mechanisms for Enhanced Oral Absorption of Hydroxysafflor Yellow
A by Chuanxiong Volatile Oil
SO PLANTA MEDICA
AB The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of Ligusticum
chuanxiong volatile oil (CVO) on the oral absorption of hydroxysafflor
yellow A (HSYA). The effects were studied both in vitro and in vivo.
The contents of CVO were measured by GC-MS. The Caco-2 cell model was
used to evaluate HSYA permeation with or without the presence of CVO.
Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of the Caco-2 cell
monolayers was monitored and the alteration in the subcellular
localization of claudin-1, the tight junction protein, was observed
by immunofluorescence. The irritation of CVO on rat intestine was
studied by paraffin slice technology. Our results demonstrated that
CVO mainly contained ligustilide (47.82%). The Papp of HSYA was
improved by 5.34-fold and 4.62-fold in the presence of 0.02 mg/mL and
0.01 mg/mL of CVO, respectively. After opening of the tight junctions
of the Caco-2 cell monolayer, TEER decreased, the position of claudin-1
changed, and its expression increased. CVO at different concentrations
10, 25, 100 and 200 mg/kg) caused no significant irritation on rat
intestine. The bioavailability of HSYA in rats was increased by
6.48-fold and 4.91-fold when 100 and 25mg/kg of CVO were
co-administrated, respectively. CVO was an effective absorption
enhancer for oral delivery of BCS III drugs. It can cause redistribution
of claudin-1 proteins and open the tight junctions.

TI NaHS ameliorates diabetic vascular injury by correcting depressed
connexin 43 and 40 in the vasculature in streptozotocin-injected rats
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Objectives Cardiovascular complication contributes an important role
to morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. We hypothesized
that these abnormalities are mainly mediated by oxidative stress,
endothelial dysfunction and impaired intracellular communications.
Thus, we examined vasoactivity and expression of connexin (Cx) 43 and
40, protein kinase C-epsilon (PKC epsilon) and NADPH oxidase of the
vasculature of thoracic aorta in streptozotocin (STZ)-injected rats,
and whether NaHS could reverse these abnormalities compared with
aminoguanidine.
Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with STZ (60 mg/kg,
i.p.) to induce diabetes. Diabetic rats were divided into untreated
and treated groups in the 5th-8th week and intervention with either
NaHS (5 mg/kg daily, s.c.) or aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg daily, p.o.)
was made.
Key findings In rats with untreated diabetes, hyperglycaemia,
increased activity of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase, increased
NO, mild vascular spasm, reduced NO bioavailability and diminished
vasorelaxation were found. These findings were accompanied by
downregulated Cx43 and Cx40, and upregulated PKC epsilon and NADPH
oxidase subunits p22(phox)/p47(phox)/p67(phox) in the thoracic aorta.
NaHS appears to be as effective as aminoguanidine in attenuating these
abnormalities.
Conclusions NaHS shows promise in relieving diabetic vascular
abnormality by upregulating junctional connexin Cx40 and Cx43, via
normalizing NADPH oxidase and PKC epsilon in the vasculature.

AB Chuktabularins E-T (1-16), 16 new 16-norphragmalin limonoids, together
with four known compounds, chuktabularins A D, were isolated from the
stem bark of Chukrasia tabularis var. veltaina. These compounds possess
a biosynthetically extended propionyl or acetyl group at C-15 and a
characteristic ketal moiety between the limonoid skeleton and the acyl
substituent at C-15. The structures of these compounds were established
on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis, and that of 1 was
confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment,
representing the first verification of the skeleton of
16-norphragmalin limonoids. Chuktabularins K-O (7-11) were found to
be the first 19-acetoxylated 16-norphragmalin limonoids.
Variable-temperature H-1 NMR experiments suggested that 7 exists as
an equilibrium mixture of conformational isomers in solution. The
absolute configuration of 5 was determined by the CD exciton chirality
method on its 11,12-di-p-chlorobenzoate (5a), and those of 1-4 and 6-16
were proposed by correlating with 5 spectroscopically and

TI Structure-based and shape-complemented pharmacophore modeling for the
discovery of novel checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING
AB Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), a member of the serine/threonine kinase
family, is an attractive therapeutic target for anticancer combination
therapy. A structure-based modeling approach complemented with shape
components was pursued to develop a reliable pharmacophore model for
ATP-competitive Chk1 inhibitors. Common chemical features of the
pharmacophore model were derived by clustering multiple
structure-based pharmacophore features from different Chk1-ligand
complexes in comparable binding modes. The final model consisted of
one hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), one hydrogen bond donor (HBD), two
hydrophobic (HY) features, several excluded volumes and shape
constraints. In the validation study, this feature-shape query yielded
an enrichment factor of 9.196 and performed fairly well at
distinguishing active from inactive compounds, suggesting that the
pharmacophore model can serve as a reliable tool for virtual screening
to facilitate the discovery of novel Chk1 inhibitors. Besides, these
pharmacophore features were assumed to be essential for Chk1
inhibitors, which might be useful for the identification of potential
Chk1 inhibitors.

TI 23-Hydroxybetulinic acid from Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regel
synergizes the antitumor activities of doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Ethnopharmacological revelance: Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regel
has been used as adjuvant in chemotherapy in traditional Chinese
medicine. 23-Hydroxybetulinic acid, an isolated pentacyclic
triterpene, is the major active constituent of Pulsatilla chinensis
(Bunge) Regel.
Aim of this study: To evaluate the combinational anticancer effect of
23-hydroxybetulinic acid and doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo.
Materials and methods: The effect of combination treatment with
23-hydroxybetulinic acid and doxorubicin was evaluated with a
quantitative combination index method based on the median-effect
analysis in various cancer cell lines. And in vivo efficacy of
combination chemotherapy was also evaluated using ICR mice bearing
sarcoma 180 carcinoma tumors.
Results: 23-Hydroxybetulinic acid showed a synergistic cytotoxic
effect on multiple cancer cell lines by combined use with doxorubicin.
In vivo studies further demonstrated that co-administration of 23-HBA
significantly improved the sensitivity of the tumor to doxorubicin
through increasing intra-tumor doxorubicin concentration and
inhibiting doxorubicin-induced up-regulation of P-gp in tumor.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the combined therapy with
23-hydroxybetulinic acid and doxorubicin may be a new promising
strategy to promote the clinical chemotherapy, which needs further
verification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Regulation of NT-PGC-1 alpha Subcellular Localization and Function by
Protein Kinase A-dependent Modulation of Nuclear Export by CRM1
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 alpha
(PGC-1 alpha) plays a central role in the regulation of cellular energy
metabolism and metabolic adaptation to environmental and nutritional
stimuli. We recently described a novel, biologically active splice
variant of PGC-1 alpha (NT-PGC-1 alpha, amino acids 1-270) that retains
the ability to interact with and transactivate nuclear hormone
receptors through its N-terminal transactivation domain. Whereas PGC-1
alpha is an unstable nuclear protein sensitive to ubiquitin-mediated
targeting to the proteasome, NT-PGC-1 alpha is relatively stable and
predominantly cytoplasmic, suggesting that its ability to interact
with and activate nuclear receptors and transcription factors is
dependent upon regulated access to the nucleus. We provide evidence
that NT-PGC-1 alpha interacts with the nuclear exportin, CRM1, through
a specific leucine-rich domain (nuclear export sequence) that
regulates its export to the cytoplasm. The nuclear export of NT-PGC-1
alpha is inhibited by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of
Ser-194, Ser-241, and Thr-256 on NT-PGC-1 alpha, which effectively
increases its nuclear concentration. Using site-directed mutagenesis
to prevent or mimic phosphorylation at these sites, we show that the
transcriptional activity of NT-PGC-1 alpha is regulated in part through
regulation of its subcellular localization. These findings suggest
that the function of NT-PGC-1 alpha as a transcriptional co-activator
is regulated by protein kinase A-dependent inhibition of CRM1-mediated
export from the nucleus.

TI Alleviation of ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats by Panax
notoginseng saponins
SO JOURNAL OF NATURAL MEDICINES
AB To examine the effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the main
active components of Panax notoginseng, on ovariectomy-induced
osteoporosis in rats. A total of 72 six-month-old female rats were
randomly assigned to sham-operated group and five ovariectomized (OVX)
groups: OVX with distilled water (5 ml/kg/day, p.o.), OVX with graded
doses of PNS (75, 150, 300 mg/kg/day, p.o.), and OVX with nilestriol
(1 mg/kg/week, p.o.). Animals were sacrificed after a 13-week treatment
course. Compared with the OVX group, PNS administration prevented
OVX-induced decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar vertebrae
and total femur, and significantly increased bone structural
biomechanical properties. Improvements of BMD and biomechanical
properties were accompanied by the beneficial changes of PNS on
trabecular microarchitecture in the tibial metaphysis. PNS at the
highest dose significantly prevent decrease in trabecular bone volume
over bone total volume, trabecular number, trabecular thickness,
connectivity density, and increase in trabecular separation and
structure model index in OVX rats. The bone-modulating effects of PNS
may be due to the increased bone formation and decreased bone
resorption, as was evidenced by the elevated level of serum alkaline
phosphatase and decreased level of urinary deoxypyridinoline. PNS
treatment is able to enhance BMD, bone strength, and prevent the
deterioration of trabecular microarchitecture without hyperplastic
effect on uterus. Therefore, PNS might be a potential alternative
medicine for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal
osteoporosis.

T Synthesis of a novel polymer bile salts-(polyethylene

targeting of liposomal DDB
DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRIAL PHARMACY
A Purpose: The objective of this study was to achieve a sustained and
B targeted delivery of liposome to the liver, by modifying the
phospholipid [phosphatidylcholine (PC)/cholesterol (10 : 1) liposomes
with a novel polymer bile salts-(polyethylene glycol)(2000)-bile salts
(BP2B). Methods: First, we generated a novel BP2B by
N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/4-dimethylaminopyridine
esterification method and confirmed by Fourier transform infraredand
H-1-NMR spectra. Second, we prepared the BP2B-modified liposomes
(BP2BL) that included BP2B, and the effect of the weight ratios of
BP2B/PC on entrapment efficiency was investigated and BP2B/PC = 3%
(w/w) was determined as the optimum ratio for the
4,4'-dimethoxy-5,6,5',6'-bi(methylenedioxy)-2,2'-bicarbomethoxybip
henyl liposomes. And then, the ability of the liver target of BP2BL
was studied by calculating the targeted parameters. Results and
Discussion: All the results revealed that the introduction of
polyoxyethylene chains could control interactions of bile salt
moieties on liposome surfaces with the receptor compared with
traditional liposomes (CL), marking BP2BL as a suitable carrier for
hepatic parenchymal cell-specific and sustained targeting. It was
suggested that liposomes containing such novel BP2B have great
potential as drug delivery carriers for the liver-selective targeting
that has targeted and sustained drug delivery.

TI Efficient amplification of genes involved in microbial secondary
metabolism by an improved genome walking method
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Genome walking is a commonly used technique for the identification of
DNA sequences adjacent to known regions. Despite the development of
various genome walking methods, nonspecific products are often
produced in certain circumstances, especially when GC-rich DNA
sequences are dealt with. To effectively resolve such technical issues,
a simple nested polymerase chain reaction-based genome walking method
has been developed by implementing a progressively decreased annealing
temperature from 70A degrees C to 47.5A degrees C in the first round
of amplification and a high annealing temperature of 65A degrees C in
the second round of amplification. During the entire process, a lower
ramp rate of 1.5A degrees C s(-1) and cooling rate of 2.5A degrees C
s(-1) are performed to reach the annealing temperature. Using this
method, we successfully obtained the upstream and downstream sequences
of three GC-rich genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of
secondary metabolites from two bacterial genomes. The efficient
amplification of DNA target longer than 1.5 Kb with GC content up to
75.0% indicates that the present technique could be a valuable tool
for the investigation of biosynthetic pathways of various secondary
metabolites.

TI Gene expression analysis on a photodiode array-based bioluminescence
analyzer by using sensitivity-improved SRPP
SO ANALYST
AB Most methods used for gene expression analysis are based on
dye-labeling, which requires costly instruments. Recently a dye-free
gene expression analysis method-SRPP (Sequence-tagged
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction coupled with
pyrosequencing) was developed to compare relative gene expression
levels in different tissues, but the throughput of the SRPP assay is
very limited due to the use of a photomultiplier tube (PMT)-based
pyrosequencer for the detection. To increase the throughput of the SRPP
assay, an inexpensive photodiode (PD) array-based bioluminescence
analyzer (termed as "PD-based pyrosequencer'') was coupled to SRPP;
however the low sensitivity of PD limited the wide application of SRPP.
To enable SRPP analyzing low abundance genes in clinical samples,
sequence-tagged gene-specific primers instead of sequence-tagged poly
(T)(n) primers were used for reverse-transcription, and the SRPP
sensitivity was thus improved more than 10 times. This improvement
compensates the sensitivity loss due to the use of PD in a
pyrosequencer. The accurate determination of the expression levels of
ten prognostic marker genes (AL080059, MMP9, EXT1, ORC6L, AF052162,
C9orf30, FBXO31, IGFBP5, ESM1, and RUNDC1) differing between normal
tissues and tumor tissues of breast cancer patients demonstrated that
SRPP using gene-specific RT primers coupled with the PD array-based
bioluminescence analyzer is reliable, inexpensive, and sensitive in
gene expression analysis.

SO ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA
AB Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have emerged as important anti. tumor
targets in recent years. As HDACs comprise multiple isoforms and there
are different physiological functions among various isoforms, the
development of selective HDAC inhibitors has attracted a great deal
of attention. This study focused on the discovery of selective HDAC1,
HDAC8 inhibitors and specifically a homology model for HDAC1 was
generated. A comparison was made between the HDAC1 homology model and
the crystal structure of HDAC8, which showed that some active site
residues were different from each other and these residues played
important roles in the selectivity between HDAC1 and HDAC8. Two linear
regression models were established based on the inhibitory activities
against HDAC1, HDAC8 and the docking scores of 52 compounds. The
developed linear regression models for HDAC1 and HDAC8 have non. cross
validated correlation coefficients R-2 of 0.82 and 0.80, respectively,
which indicates that the results are statistically significant. These
models were used to predict the activities of the synthesized compounds
and these prediction results can provide further insights into the

TI Purification and identification of three novel antioxidant peptides
from Cornu Bubali (water buffalo horn)
SO PEPTIDES
AB Cornu Bubali (water buffalo horn, WBH) has been used in Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years. In the present study,
three peptides with antioxidant properties were purified from aqueous
extract of Cornu Bubali (water buffalo horn, WBH) by consecutive
chromatographic methods including gel filtration chromatography,
ion-exchange chromatography and high performance liquid
chromatography. The sequences of the three peptides were identified
to be Gln-Tyr-Asp-Gln-Gly-Val (WBH-1, 708 Da),
Tyr-Glu-Asp-Cys-Thr-Asp-Cys-Gly-Asn (WBH-2, 1018 Da) and
Ala-Ala-Asp-Asn-Ala-Asn-Glu-Leu-Phe-Pro-Pro-Asn (WBH-3, 1271 Da) by
matrix assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-LIFT-TOF/TOF
MS). The antioxidant activity of these peptides was tested using
1-dipheny1-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay directly.
Methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
release assay were also used to evaluate the protection of peptides
against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced injury. The results showed
that these peptides could reduce the DPPH radical and protect rat
cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (rCMECs) against
H2O2-induced injury, thus demonstrating that these peptides had
antioxidant activity. These results suggest that WBH-1, WBH-2 and
WBH-3, isolated from the aqueous extract of water buffalo horn are
natural antioxidants and may contribute to the efficacy of WBH. (C)

TI Constituents of Da-Cheng-Qi Decoction and its Parent Herbal Medicines
Determined by LC-MS/MS
SO NATURAL PRODUCT COMMUNICATIONS
AB Da-Cheng-Qi decoction (DCQD) is a purgative prescription used in China
and East Asia. To profile the constituents of this complex traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM), a high-performance liquid chromatographic,
electrospray ionization, tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-ESI/MS/MS)
analytical method was developed. After separation on a reversed-phase
C18 analytical column using gradient elution, samples were analyzed
by ESI-MS/MS in negative mode. As a result, a total of 37 compounds
were detected, of which two tannins, three anthraquinones, two
sennosides, Five flavonoids and two lignans were unambiguously
identified by comparison with standard compounds, and sixteen
compounds were either tentatively identified or deduced according to
their MS/MS data. The fragmentation pathways of many of the observed
compounds, such as the tannins and lignans are reported for the first
time. In addition, the identity of each peak in DCQD was explored by
comparison with those of its three constituent herbs. The results
indicated that tannins, anthraquinones and sennosides in DCQD
originated from Radix et Rhizoma Rhei, flavonoids from Fructus Aurantii
Immaturus, and lignans from Cortex Magnoliae officinalis. The present
study provides an example of chemical constitution profiling in complex
TCM systems using LC/MS/MS.

TI Pharmacokinetic Comparison in Rats of Six Bioactive Compounds Between
Da-Cheng-Qi Decoction and its Parent Herbal Medicines
SO NATURAL PRODUCT COMMUNICATIONS
AB Da-Cheng-Qi decoction (DCQD) is a purgative compound prescription used
in China and East Asia. In this paper, pharmacokinetic differences of
six major active components (rhein, emodin, aloe-emodin, magnolol,
naringenin and hesperetin) between DCQD and its three constitutional
herbal medicines i.e. Radix et Rhizoma Rhei, Cortex Magnoliae
officinalis and Fructus Aurantii Immantrus were investigated in rats
after oral administration. Plasma samples were analyzed for the
quantification of the six active components using validated LC-MS/MS
methods. Unpaired Student's t-test was used for statistical
comparison. Significant differences (p<0.05) in the main
pharmacokinetic parameters for rhein, emodin, aloe-emodin, magnolol,
naringenin and hesperetin were found between DCQD and the decoction
of its constitutional single herbal medicines, which demonstrated the
presence of drug-drug interactions between these constitutional raw
materials of DCQD occurring either in the procedure of decoction or
during ADME process.

AB In order to complete the SAR and discover new potent and selective PCOs,
some changes were made to the C-4 and C-2 substitutions of cromakalim.
A series of 4 -amino acid substituted -2, 2-dialkylchromans
structurally related to cromakalim were synthesized and evaluated, as
ATP-sensitive potassium channel openers (8a-l). Preliminary
biological tests suggested that these compounds exhibited potent to
mild relaxation activity of the KCl-contracted rat aortic strips.
Compounds 8b (IC50 = 0.25 mu M), 8f (IC50 = 6.44 mu M) and 8j (IC50
= 8.65 mu M) exhibited commendable opening activity of potassium
channels. In addition to anti-hypertension, these compounds can also
be considered as lead candidates for the further development of

TI Rough set-based SAR analysis: An inductive method
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Rough set algorithm was used as a new methodology to build
structure-activity relationship (SAR) models in this paper. It acted
as feature selector and nonlinear rule generator. The SAR model
expressed as human readable if-then rules was developed for the
inhibition of the serine/threonine kinase CDK1/cyclinB by compounds
from the indirubin inhibitor family. The feature selection ability of
rough set algorithm was compared with the build-in approaches
(CfsSubsetEval and ConsistencySubsetEval) in Weka under leave-one-out
(LOO) and 10-fold cross-validation. Through training a set of 31
objects, a rule-based SAR model had been built with a reduct generated
by rough set. The predictability of the model was evaluated by an
external test set of 16 compounds. The existing powerful approaches,
such as the decision tree learners, neural network, support vector
classifier and LogitBoost approaches, were used to verify the
performance of rough set method. It revealed that rough set method
should play important role in data preprocessing and model building
of nonlinear SAR analysis. The advantages and limitations of rough
set-based SAR analysis were discussed. The results were satisfactorily
in accordance with the available understanding of cocrystal structures
and 3D QSAR models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhancement of intestinal absorption of akebia saponin D by borneol
and probenecid in situ and in vitro
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Akebia saponin D is a typical bioactive triterpenoid saponin isolated
the rhizome of Dipsacus asper Wall. Our previous studies demonstrated
that the oral bioavailability of akebia saponin D was very low, but
the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. The present study aims to
investigate the intestinal absorptive characteristics of akebia
saponin D as well as the absorptive transport behavior influenced by
co-administration of three absorption-enhancing agents and three
efflux protein inhibitors using an in vitro everted gut sac method and
an in situ intestinal perfusion model. The results showed that akebia
saponin D had a quite limited intestinal permeability, and there was
a non-linear increase in transepithelial transportation with
increasing concentrations of akebia saponin D. The absorption of akebia
saponin D was intestinal segment selective and the small intestine was
the best absorptive site. Among three absorption promoters, borneol
could significantly improve the permeability of akebia saponin D across
ileum, while Tween-80 and DMSO had almost no absorption-enhancing
effect. In addition, verapamil, probenecid and pantoprazole in the
perfusates were used in this study as modulators of transporters such
as P-glycoprotein, MRPs and BCRP in the intestinal mucosa,
respectively. The results exhibited that the ileal permeability of
akebia saponin D was markedly elevated by the co-administration of
probenecid, indicating that akebia saponin D may be likely a substrate
of MRPs. The above-mentioned results suggest that akebia saponin D has
a poor intestinal absorption not only due to its poor transepithelial
permeability but also owing to the contribution of efflux transporters
such as MRPs in the intestine. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Simultaneous Analysis of Zofenopril and Its Active Metabolite
Zofenoprilat in Human Plasma by LC-ESI-MS Using Pre-Column
Derivatization with p-Bromophenacyl Bromide
SO CHROMATOGRAPHIA
AB Zofenoprilat is an active metabolite of zofenopril, which is very
unstable in plasma because of oxidative degradation of its thiol group.
In this method, p-bromophenacyl bromide was used as derivatization
reagent, immediately after plasma separation, to react with the free
thiol group of zofenoprilat and form the derivative
zofenoprilat-p-BPB. After acidification with 50% acetic acid, the
derivatized plasma samples were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether
and separated on a C-18 column with 40:60 (v/v) 10 mM ammonium acetate
buffer solution containing 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile as mobile
phase. Calibration plots were linear over the concentration range 1-500
ng mL(-1) for zofenopril and 2-1,800 ng mL(-1) for zofenoprilat. The
method was successfully used to study the bioavailability of zofenopril
calcium capsules relative to that of zofenopril calcium tablets in
healthy Chinese volunteers.

TI Darbufelone, a novel anti-inflammatory drug, induces growth inhibition
of lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo
SO CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development of lung cancer.
Accumulated studies have proved that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) which block inflammation by their actions on arachidonic
acid (AA) metabolism have a potential role in cancer chemotherapy and
chemoprevention. The aim of our study was to investigate whether
darbufelone, a novel anti-inflammatory drug, has anticancer effects
in lung cancer.
Human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were treated with
darbufelone at various doses and time points for analysis of cell
viability, cell cycle, and apoptosis in vitro. The in vivo effect of
darbufelone was assessed in Lewis lung carcinoma mice model.
Darbufelone inhibited the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer
cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and induced cell cycle arrest
at G0/G1 phase through up-regulation of p27 expression. Treatment with
darbufelone also induced apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and
caspase-8. Lewis lung carcinoma growth was also significantly
inhibited by darbufelone treatment at daily dose of 80 mg/kg.
Taken together, these studies suggested that darbufelone, an
anti-inflammation drug, might represent a novel therapeutic approach
for lung cancer treatment.

SO VACCINE
AB Mucosal administration of autoantigen 1451,65 can induce

HSP65 serves as an immunogenic carrier for a diabetogenic peptide P277
can also Induce anti-inflammatory immune response in NOD mice by

of HSP65 and P277 will be obtained To test this hypothesis, we examined
the effect of intranasal vaccination with P277 tandem repeat sequences
carried by HSP65 in the absence of adjuvants on autoimmune diabetes
in NOD mice. We found a significant decrease in the incidence of
diabetes, inhibition of insulitis, reduction in IgG2a isotype
antibodies to P277 and proinflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-2
secretion, increased IgG1, IgG2b subclass antibodies to P277 and
anti-inflammatory cytokmes IL-10 and IL-4 secretion, and reduced
proliferation in nasal administration of the fusion protein HSP65-6
x P277 Our results demonstrate that HSP65 may serve as a particularly
advantageous carrier for P277-based vaccines and mucosal

TI Sex differences in subacute toxicity and hepatic microsomal metabolism
of triptolide in rats
SO TOXICOLOGY
AB Triptolide, a major active component of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook
F (TWHF), has multiple pharmacological activities. However, its
clinical use is often limited by its severe toxicity. In the present
study, we evaluated the oral toxicity of triptolide in Sprague-Dawley
rats for 28 days at the dosages of 0, 200 and 400 mu g/kg/day,
respectively. Significant difference in the toxicity of triptolide at
400 mu g/kg was found between different sexes. The triptolide-treated
female rats showed many abnormalities, including anorexia, diarrhea,
leanness, suppression of weight gain and food intake, fatty liver,
splenomegaly and atrophy of ovaries. In contrast, no such abnormalities
were observed in male rats except for the significant reproductive
toxicity. Furthermore, the metabolism of triptolide in liver
microsomes from both sexes was investigated by HPLC. A greater rate
of triptolide metabolism was observed in male rat hepatic microsomes,
suggesting that one of the cytochrome P450s (CYPs) responsible for
triptolide metabolism is male-specific or predominant at least. The
inhibition experiments with CYP inhibitors showed that CYP3A and CYP2B
were mainly involved in the metabolism of triptolide. In addition,
since CYP3A2 is a male-predominant form in rats, significant sex
difference in the metabolism of triptolide disappeared in vitro after
anti-rat CYP3A2 antibody pretreatment. Results suggested that CYP3A2
made an important contribution to the sex-related metabolism of
triptolide, which may result in the sex differences in triptolide
toxicity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

extracted from gastrodia elata Bl. in the aqueous solution. The effects
of six parameters including ethanol-water compositions, extraction
time, extraction temperature, particle size, solvent volume, and
ultrasonic power on the extraction yield of gastrodin were
investigated. According to the orthogonal design, the optimal

volume 8mL center dot g-1, ethanol-water compositions 70%, and particle
size 10-20 mesh. Though the yield of gastrodin via ultrasonic
extraction was about 0.01% lower than that from the reflux extraction,
the extraction time of the ultrasonic extraction was greatly shortened.
Therefore, ultrasonic extraction has high efficiency and is proved to
be very valuable in the extraction of gastrodin from gastrodia elata

TI Identification of Hydroxyxanthones as Na/K-ATPase Ligands
SO MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY
AB We have screened a chemical library and identified several novel
structures of Na/K-ATPase inhibitors. One group of these inhibitors
belongs to polyphenolic xanthone derivatives. Functional
characterization reveals the following properties of this group of
inhibitors. First, like ouabain, they are potent inhibitors of the
purified Na/K-ATPase. Second, their effects on the Na/K-ATPase depend
on the number and position of phenolic groups. Methylation of these
phenolic groups reduces the inhibitory effect. Third, further
characterization of the most potent xanthone derivative, MB7
(3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone), reveals that it does not change either
Na+ or ATP affinity of the enzyme. Finally, unlike that of ouabain,
the inhibitory effect of MB7 on Na/K-ATPase is not antagonized by K+.
Moreover, MB7 does not activate the receptor Na/K-ATPase/Src complex

we have identified a group of novel Na/K-ATPase ligands that can inhibit
the pumping function without stimulating the signaling function of
Na/K-ATPase.

TI The separate roles of endothelin receptors participate in remodeling
of matrix metalloproteinase and connexin 43 of cardiac fibroblasts in
maladaptive response to isoproterenol
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Stress may affect gap junction connexin 43 and matrix
metalloproteinase-2/9 (MMP-2/9) in cardiac fibroblasts, potentially
contributing to worsening cardiac function and arrhythmias. Cardiac
fibroblasts isolated from neonatal rat were incubated with
isoproterenol at 3 x 10(-7) M to mimic stress and were treated with
either PD156707 or IRL-1038 (selective antagonists for endothelin A
and B receptor respectively) and CPU0213 (a dual endothelin A/B
receptor antagonist) at 1 x 10(-8) M, 3 x 10(-8) M or 1 x 10(-7) M.
RT-PCR and Western blotting were conducted. Upregulation of the two
endothelin receptors, MMP-2/9 and NADPH oxidase subunits (p22phox and
p47phox), and downregulation of connexin 43 in cardiac fibroblasts were
found in the presence of isoproterenol and were attenuated by the
selective blockers PD156707 and IRL-1038 in a dose-dependent manner.
IRL-1038 was less effective. CPU0213 appeared to be more effective than
the two selective blockers in blocking these changes. Changes in
cardiac fibroblasts in response to isoproterenol mediated by
upregulation of the endothelin-NADPH oxidase pathway may play a role
in deteriorating cardiac function and arrhythmias. The endothelin A
receptor has a major role, relative to the endothelin B receptor, in
the remodeling of cardiac fibroblasts during isoproterenol
stimulation. CPU0213, a dual endothelin receptor A/B blocker, seems
to be more effective in normalizing these changes than do the selective
endothelin receptor antagonists. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

TI Effect of danshen extract on the activity of CYP3A4 in healthy
volunteers
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB center dot Many cytochrome P450 mediated interactions have been
reported between drug and herbal medicines. In particular, CYP3A4 is
known to play a critical role in several clinically relevant herb-drug
interactions. Midazolam has been reported to be one of the preferred
in vivo CYP3A probes.
center dot It has been reported that the lipophilic components of
danshen could induce CYP3A in C57BL/6J mice, that cryptotanshinone and
tanshinone IIA of danshen extract could activate human PXR and
consequently induce the expression of the CYP3A4 gene.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
center dot Co-administration of multiple doses of danshen tablets
caused an increase in apparent oral clearance of midazolam by 35.4%,
a corresponding decline in C-max by 31.1% and a decline in
AUC(0,infinity) by 27.0% in human volunteers. The t(1/2) of midazolam
and 1-hydroxymidazolam were not changed, and the C-max and
AUC(0,infinity) ratio of midazolam to 1-hydroxymidazolam were not
affected. The results suggested that multiple dose administration of
danshen tablets could induce CYP3A4 in the gut, thereby increasing the
clearance of midazolam. Therefore, caution should be taken when danshen
products containing lipophilic components are used in combination with
therapeutic drugs metabolized by CYP3A.
AIMS
To assess the effect of danshen extract on CYP3A4 activity using
midazolam as an in vivo probe.
METHODS
A sequential, open-label, two-period pharmacokinetic interaction
study design was used to compare midazolam pharmacokinetic parameters
before and after 14 days of administration of danshen tablets. Twelve
healthy volunteers received a single oral dose (15 mg) of midazolam
followed by danshen tablets (four tablets orally, three times a day)
for 14 days. On the last day of the study they received four danshen
tablets with a 15 mg midazolam tablet and plasma concentrations of
midazolam and its corresponding metabolite 1-hydroxylmidazolam were
measured prior to and after the administration of danshen tablets
periodically for 12 h.
RESULTS
The 90% confidence intervals of C(max,)t(1/2), CL/F and
AUC(0,infinity) of midazolam before and after administration of
danshen tablets were (0.559, 0.849), (0.908, 1.142), (1.086, 1.688)
and (0.592, 0.921), respectively; and those of C-max, t(1/2) and
AUC(0,infinity) of 1-hydroxylmidazolam after vs. before
administration of danshen tablets were (0.633, 0.923), (0.801, 1.210)
and (0.573, 0.980), respectively. Ratios of geometric LS means of
C-max(1OHMid) : C-max(Mid) and AUC(max(1OHMid)) : AUC(max(Mid)) (after
vs. before 14-day danshen) were 1.072 and 1.035, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that multiple dose administration of danshen
tablets may induce CYP3A4 in the gut. Accordingly, caution should be
taken when danshen products are used in combination with therapeutic
drugs metabolized by CYP3A.

TI Synthesis and evaluation of nitric oxide-releasing derivatives of
farnesylthiosalicylic acid as anti-tumor agents
SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Novel furoxan-based nitric oxide (NO)-releasing derivatives (11a-p)
of farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTA) were synthesized. Compounds 11d,
11f, 11k, and 11m-o displayed anti-tumor activities superior to FTA
and sorafenib in most cancer cells tested. Analysis of six compounds
revealed that 11d, 11f, 11n, 11o, and 11p, but not 11a that had low
anti-tumor activity, produced high levels of NO, associated with their
strong anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, the anti-tumor activity of
11f was partially mimicked by the furoxan moiety, but reduced by
pre-treatment with hemoglobin. Importantly, treatment with 11f
inhibited Ras-related signaling in cancer cells. Apparently, the high
anti-tumor activity of 11f was attributed to the synergic effect of
high levels of NO production and inhibition of Ras-related signaling
in cancer cells. Our findings suggest that the furoxan/FTA hybrids may
hold greater promise as therapeutic agents for the intervention of
human cancers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Transcriptional response of Candida albicans biofilms following
exposure to 2-amino-nonyl-6-methoxyl-tetralin muriate
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To identify changes in the gene expression profile of Candida
albicans (C albicans) biofilms following exposed to
2-amino-nonyl-6-methoxyl-tetralin muriate(10b) and clarify the
mechanism of 10b against C albicans biofilms.
Methods: Anti-biofilm activity of 10b was assessed by tetrazolium (XTT)
reduction assay and the action mechanism against biofilms was
investigated by cDNA microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR assay.
Results: Ten differentially expressed genes were directly linked to
biofilm formation and filamentous or hyphal growth (eg, NRG1, ECE1 and
CSA1). Decreased gene expression was involved in glycolysis (eg, HXK2
and PFK1) and antioxidant defense (eg, SOD5), while increased gene
expression was associated with enzymes that specifically hydrolyzed
beta-1,3 glucan (XOG1), and with lipid, fatty acid and sterol
metabolism (eg, SLD1, ERG6 and ERG2). Functional analysis indicated
that addition of anti-oxidant ascorbic acid reduced inhibitory
efficiency of 10b on mature biofilm.
Conclusion: Inhibition of 10b on biofilm formation possibly depends
on impairing the ability of C albicans to change its morphology via
altering the expression of biofilm formation genes. Mitochondrial
aerobic respiration shift and endogenous ROS augmentation might be a
major contribution to reduce mature biofilm metabolic activity. The
data may be useful for the development of new strategies to reduce the
incidence of device-associated infections.

TI Pharmacokinetic interactions induced by content variation of major
water-soluble components of Danshen preparation in rats
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To investigate the pharmacokinetic interactions induced by
content variation of the main water-soluble components of Danshen
injection in rats.
Methods: Intravenous Danshen injection (control) or Danshen injection
with danshensu (DSS), protocatechuic aldehyde (PAL), salvianolic acid
A (Sal A) or salvianolic acid B (Sal B) were administered to female
Sprague Dawley rats. Plasma concentrations of DSS, Sal A, PAL and its
oxidative metabolite protocatechuic acid (PA) were analyzed
simultaneously with LC-MS/MS; concentrations of Sal B were determined
by the LC-MS method. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were
calculated and compared for identifying the pharmacokinetic
interactions among these components.
Results: Compared with the control group, the DSS, Sal A, and Sal B
groups had significant increases in AUC(0-infinity) in response to
elevated concentrations of PAL (by 78.1%, 51.0%, and 82.9%,
respectively), while the clearances (CL) were markedly reduced (by
42.5%, 32.9%, and 46.8%, respectively). Similarly, Sal A increased the
AUC(0-infinity) of DSS and Sal B (26.7% and 82.4%, respectively) and
substantially decreased their clearances (21.4% and 45.6%,
respectively). In addition, the pharmacokinetics of DSS and Sal B were
significantly affected by the content variation of the other major
components; the AUC(0-infinity) increased by 45.1% and 52.1%,
respectively, the CL dropped by 29.6% and 27.1%, respectively, and the
T-1/2 was decreased by 22.0% and 19.6%, respectively.
Conclusion: Complex, extensive pharmacokinetic interactions were
observed among the major water-soluble constituents in the Danshen
injection. The content variation of PAL had the most significant effect
on the pharmacokinetic behaviors of other major constituents.
Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of DSS and Sal B were the most
susceptible to the content change of other components.

TI Isolation of Bdellovibrio as Biological Therapeutic Agents Used For
the Treatment of Aeromonas hydrophila Infection in Fish
SO ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB P>Fourteen strains of Bdellovibrio-like organisms were isolated from
cultured fish ponds using Aeromonas hydrophila J-1 as host, one of them
formed large plaques after 48 h of incubation at 28 degrees C on a double
layer plate, designated as Bdellovibrio C-1. The Bdellovibrio was
confirmed by electron microscopy and PCR amplification of
Bdellovibrio-specific 16S rDNA. The optimum temperature for the growth
of BdC-1 was between 15-37 degrees C and with optimal activity at
temperatures of 25-30 degrees C. The ability of BdC-1 to lyse A.
hydrophila was similar in the pH range of 6.5 to 8.5. It can lyse 23
Gram-negative bacterial strains comprising three genera of fish
pathogens and one strain of Escherichia coli but cannot lyse
Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtillis and Staphylococcus
aureus. Immersion of fish in water containing different concentrations
of BdC-1 was used in protection against an experimental infection of
A. hydrophila J-1. Results show that the mortality of groups immersed
with BdC-1 was lower than the group without BdC-1. These results suggest
that it may be possible to use Bdellovibrio to control the disease
caused by A. hydrophila.

TI NEUROPROTECTION OF ETHANOL AGAINST ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION-INDUCED BRAIN
INJURY THROUGH DECREASING c-Jun N-TERMINAL KINASE 3 (JNK3) ACTIVATION
BY ENHANCING GABA RELEASE
SO NEUROSCIENCE
AB Our latest study indicated that ethanol could attenuate cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury through activating
Ionotropic glutamate receptors Kainate Family (Gluk1)-kainate (KA)
receptors and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. However, the
possible mechanism of the neuroprotective effects of ethanol remains
unclear. In this study we report that ethanol shows neuroprotective
effects against ischemic brain injury through enhancing GABA release
and then decreasing c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) activation.
Electrophysiologic recording indicated that ethanol enhances GABA
release from presynaptic neurons and the released GABA subsequently
inhibits the KA receptor mediated whole-cell currents. Moreover, our
data show that ethanol can inhibit the increased assembly of the
Gluk2-PSD-95-MLK3 (postsynaptic density protein-95, PSD-95 and
mixed-lineage kinase 3, MLK3) module induced by cerebral ischemia and
the activation of the MLK3-MKK4/7-JNK (mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase 4/7, MKK4/7) cascade. Pretreatment of the GABA(A)
receptor antagonist bicuculline and antagonist of VGCC (a
broad-spectrum blocker of the voltage-gated calcium channel [VGCC])
Chromic (CdCl2) can demolish the neuroprotective effects of ethanol.
The results suggest that during ischemia-reperfusion, ethanol may
activate presynaptic Gluk1-KA and facilitate Ca2+-dependent GABA
release. The released GABA activates postsynaptic GABAA receptors,
which suppress the ischemic depolarization and decrease the
association of signaling module Gluk2-PSD-95-MLK3 induced by the
activation of postsynaptic Gluk2-KA receptors. There is a raised
possibility that ethanol inhibiting the JNK3 apoptotic pathway
(MLK3/MKK4/7/JNK3/c-Jun/Fas-L) performs a neuroprotective function
against ischemic brain injury. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier

TI Influence of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms on
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gliclazide in healthy Chinese
Han volunteers
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS
AB P>Background and objective:
CYP2C9 is the major contributor to gliclazide metabolic clearance in
vitro, while the pharmacokinetics of gliclazide modified release are
affected mainly by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms in vivo. This study
aims to investigate the influence of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 genetic
polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
gliclazide in healthy Chinese Han volunteers.
Methods:
Eighteen healthy Han subjects with various combinations of CYP2C9 and
CYP2C19 genotypes received 80 mg gliclazide. Plasma gliclazide
concentrations were measured by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry method for 84 h and plasma glucose and insulin levels were
measured up to 15 h post-dose.
Results and discussion:
There was no difference in either pharmacokinetic and or
pharmacodynamic parameters of gliclazide when group A (CYP2C9*1/*1,
CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers) was compared with group B
(CYP2C9*1/*3, CYP2C19 *1/*1). When group C (CYP2C9*1/*1 and CYP2C19
poor metabolizers) was compared with group A, the AUC(0-infinity) and
C-max in group C were significantly higher [83 center dot 94 +/- 40
center dot 41 vs. 16 center dot 39 +/- 5 center dot 10 mu g center dot
h/mL (P = 0 center dot 000) and 1 center dot 50 +/- 0 center dot 85
vs. 0 center dot 45 +/- 0 center dot 18 mu g/mL (P = 0 center dot 000)],
and the oral clearance was significantly lower [1 center dot 17 +/0 center dot 63 vs. 5 center dot 38 +/- 1 center dot 86 L/h (P = 0 center
dot 000)]. The half-life of gliclazide was also significantly prolonged
in group C subjects when compared with that of group A (33 center dot
47 +/- 12 center dot 39 vs. 19 center dot 34 +/- 10 center dot 45 h),
but the difference was not significant (P = 0 center dot 052). The
increase in serum glucose level at 11 h after dosing (Delta C-glu11)
in group C was significantly higher than that of group A (-1 center
dot 08 +/- 0 center dot 42 vs. 0 center dot 22 +/- 1 center dot 01 mmol/L,
P = 0 center dot 022). The corresponding insulin levels showed no
difference between the two groups.
Conclusion:
CYP2C9*3 was not associated with any change in the disposition of
gliclazide. CYP2C19 polymorphisms appear to exert the dominant
influence on the pharmacokinetics of gliclazide in healthy Chinese Han
subjects, and may also affect the observed pharmacodynamics of the drug
as a result.

TI Separation of structurally similar nocathiacin analogues by reversed
phase chromatography
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB The complete separation of structurally similar compounds has been a
challenge due mainly to their similarity on physical and chemical
properties. In the present study, a simple and effective
chromatographic method to separate and purify nocathiacin acid from
its structural analogue nocathiacin I was developed. After evaluating
mobile phase compositions on the retention characteristics by reversed
phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the elution order
of nocathiacin land nocathiacin acid was completely reversed, and the
resolution value between the two analogues was improved, by varying
pH value and ionic strength, to greater than 10 from merged peaks under
initial conditions. In addition, a preparative isolation of
nocathiacin acid was performed by reversed phase column chromatography

TI Anti-Diabetic Effect of Standardized Extract of Potentilla discolor
Bunge and Identification of its Active Components
SO DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB Potentilla discolor Bunge, a Chinese folk medicine, has been used for
the treatment of diabetes for many years. Unfortunately, little
information is available on its bioactive components and mechanism of
action. We report the anti-diabetic effect of P. discolor on normal
and alloxan-induced diabetic mice, as well as the possible constituents
and mechanism responsible for this activity. We found that the
standardized extract of P. discolor (EPD) had little effect on the
glucose levels of normal mice, while a dose-dependent hypoglycemic
effect was observed in diabetic mice. Glucose tolerance test data
indicated that there was a significantly higher rate of glucose
disposal after EPD treatment. Phytochemical characterization
indicated that the major components of EPD were triterpenes and
flavonoids that could inhibit the activity of glycogen phosphorylase
(GP) in vitro. Tormentic acid, asiatic acid, and potengriffioside A
exhibited inhibitory effects on GP (IC50 = 90.6, 65.4, and 85.9 mu M,
respectively). The inhibition on GP may be one molecular mechanism
through which EPD ameliorates hyperglycemia. These results suggest P.
discolor extract may offer an alternate treatment for diabetes. Drug

TI Preparation of Thermostable Biotinlyted Firefly Luciferase and Its
Application to Pyrosequencing
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The next generation pyrosequencing system requires stable and
immobilized luciferase. In order to get stable and immobilized
luciferase(LUC) for the large-scale pyrosequeneing platform, the genes
coding the Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase and 87 C-terminal
residues of biotin carboxyl carrier protein(BCCP87) were inserted into
plasmid to express biotinylated fussion protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3),
and the gene of luciferase was mutated to get thermostable biotinylated
luciferase. The fusion protein was immobilized on streptavidin-coated
Beads and applied to pyrosequencing. The results of activity detection
showed that mutant luciferase had a good tolerance to heat, and still
showed activities at 50 degrees C. The mutant LUG remains 80% activities
after incubated at 43 degrees C for 10 min. Western blot analysis
indicated that the fusion protein was successfully biotinylated in E.
coli. The biotinylated luciferase immobilized on magnetic beads coated
with streptavidin showed catalytic activity of 2.1 X 10(5) RLU/mu L
beads and the activity remained nearly constant even if bead-LUC
suffered from multiple washing processes. The DNA was accurately and
quantitatively sequenced by using luciferase and adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) sulfurylase co-immobilized on magnetic beads. This
study provides an efficient and thermostable enzyme for the large-scale
chip-based pyrosequencing system.

TI A method for extracting human gait series from accelerometer signals
based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB In this paper, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is
applied to analyse accelerometer signals collected during normal human
walking. First, the self-adaptive feature of EEMD is utilised to
decompose the accelerometer signals, thus sifting out several
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) at disparate scales. Then, gait series
can be extracted through peak detection from the eigen IMF that best
represents gait rhythmicity. Compared with the method based on the
empirical mode decomposition (EMD), the EEMD-based method has the
following advantages: it remarkably improves the detection rate of peak
values hidden in the original accelerometer signal, even when the
signal is severely contaminated by the intermittent noises; this method
effectively prevents the phenomenon of mode mixing found in the process
of EMD. And a reasonable selection of parameters for the stop-filtering
criteria can improve the calculation speed of the EEMD-based method.
Meanwhile, the endpoint effect can be suppressed by using the auto
regressive and moving average model to extend a short-time series in
dual directions. The results suggest that EEMD is a powerful tool for
extraction of gait rhythmicity and it also provides valuable clues for
extracting eigen rhythm of other physiological signals.

TI Determination of asperosaponin VI in rat plasma by HPLC-ESI-MS and its
application to preliminary pharmacokinetic studies
SO BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB Asperosaponin VI (also named akebia saponin D) is a typical bioactive
triterpenoid saponin isolated from the rhizome of Dipsacus asper Wall
(Dipsacaceae). In this work, a sensitive high-performance liquid
chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry
(HPLC-ESI-MS) assay has been established for determination of
asperosaponin VI in rat plasma. With losartan as the internal standard
(IS), plasma samples were prepared by protein precipitation with
methanol. Chromatographic separation was performed on a C-18 column
with a mobile phase of 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer containing 0.05%
formic acid-methanol (32:68, v/v). The analysis was performed on an
ESI in the selected ion monitoring mode using target ions at m/z 951.4
for asperosaponin VI and miz 423.2 for the IS. The calibration curve
was linear over the range 3-1000 ng/mL and the lower limit of
quantification was 3.0 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-assay variability
values were less than 9.5 and 7.8%, respectively. The accuracies
determined at the concentrations of 3.0, 100.0, 300.0 and 1000 ng/mL
for asperosaponin VI were within 15.0%. The validated method was
successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats after oral
administration of asperosaponin VI. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley &

TI Membrane aggregation and perturbation induced by antimicrobial peptide
of S-thanatin
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Thanatin, a 21-residue peptide, is an inducible insect peptide. In our
previous study, we have identified a novel thanatin analog of
S-thanatin, which exhibited a broad antimicrobial activity against
bacteria and fungi with low hemolytic activity. This study was aimed
to delineate the antimicrobial mechanism of S-thanatin and identify
its interaction with bacterial membranes. In this study, membrane
phospholipid was found to be the target for S-thanatin. In the presence
of vesicles, S-thanatin interestingly led to the aggregation of anionic
vesicles and sonicated bacteria. Adding S-thanatin to Escherichia coli
suspension would result in the collapse of membrane and kill bacteria.
The sensitivity assay of protoplast elucidated the importance of outer
membrane (OM) for S-thanatin's antimicrobial activity. Compared with
other antimicrobial peptide, S-thanatin produced chaotic membrane
morphology and cell debris in electron microscopic appearance. These
results supported our hypothesis that S-thanatin bound to negatively
charged LPS and anionic lipid, impeded membrane respiration, exhausted
the intracellular potential, and released periplasmic material, which
led to cell death. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Antipyretic and Antioxidant Activities of the Aqueous Extract of Cornu
Bubali (Water Buffalo Horn)
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE MEDICINE
AB Cornu Bubali (water buffalo horn, WBH) is an animal-derived product
which is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for
dispelling heat, relieving convulsions and cooling blood. The purpose
of this study was to investigate the antipyretic activity of WBH aqueous
extract and its potential mechanism. Two hyperthermia models,
yeast-induced (infectious) and skimmed milk-induced (noninfectious)
hyperthermia were employed to evaluate the antipyretic effect and the
results showed that rectal temperature of hyperthermia animals was
decreased significantly after oral administration of WBH extract. The
production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced
prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) in rat cerebral microvascular endothelial
cells (rCMECs) was inhibited by WBH extract in the concentrations of
10 mu g/ml and 100 mu g/ml. The WBH extract protected rCMECs survival
from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced toxicity and inhibited the
H2O2-induced leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme release at
a dose ranging from 5 mu g/ml to 100 mu g/ml. It could also increase
the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities.
The results suggest that Cornu Bubali exhibits antipyretic activity
on both infectious and noninfectious hyperthermia. The antipyretic
activity of WBH may be due to the effects on enhancing antioxidation
enzyme activities, decreasing PGE(2) production, and protecting the
rCMECs against H2O2-induced injury.

TI Berberine suppresses intestinal disaccharidases with beneficial
metabolic effects in diabetic states, evidences from in vivo and in
vitro study
SO NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Clinical reports have demonstrated that berberine is a potential
antidiabetic agent, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. The
purpose of this study was to investigate if berberine exerts its
hypoglycemic action via inhibiting intestinal disaccharidases using
in vivo and in vitro experiments. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats
received berberine (100 or 200 mg/kg) orally once daily or acarbose
(40 mg/kg) orally twice daily for 5 weeks. Disaccharidase activities
and sucrase-isomaltase (SI) complex messenger RNA (mRNA) expression
in intestinal regions were assessed. The same treatment was operated
in normal rats. Sucrose and maltose loading tests were also documented.
In addition, Caco-2 cells were cultured in medium containing berberine
or berberine plus chelerythrine. Compound C or H-89 for 5 days,
disaccharidase activities, and SI complex mRNA levels were measured.
The animal experiments showed that berberine significantly decreased
the disaccharidase activities and SI complex mRNA expression both in
diabetic rats and normal rats. Berberine can also significantly lower
postprandial blood glucose levels induced by sucrose or maltose loading
in normal rats. The cellular results showed that berberine may suppress
disaccharidase activities and downregulate SI complex mRNA expression
in a concentration-dependent manner. Only H-89, an inhibitor of protein
kinase A (PKA), may reverse the decrease in disaccharidase activities
and SI complex mRNA expression induced by berberine. In conclusion,
berberine suppresses disaccharidase activities and SI complex mRNA
expression with beneficial metabolic effects in diabetic states. The
inhibitory effect, at least partly, involves the PKA-dependent
pathway.

TI Effect of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction on pharmacokinetics of
verapamil in rats
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Objectives The aim was to investigate the effect of
Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction (HLJDD) on the pharmacokinetic behaviour
of verapamil in rats.
Methods Rats orally received 3.33 g/kg of HLJDD extract for 14 days,
and pharmacokinetics of verapamil was investigated after oral and
intravenous verapamil. Norverapamil formation for assessing
cytochrome P450 3A activity in hepatic and intestinal microsomes of
the HLJDD-treated rats was investigated. The inhibitory effect of
berberine on the formation of norverapamil in intestinal and hepatic
microsomes was also evaluated.
Key findings HLJDD treatment increased the plasma concentration of
verapamil and decreased the plasma concentration of norverapamil,
resulting in a 24% increase in the AUC(0-480) of verapamil and a 25%
reduction in the AUC(0-480) of norverapamil after oral administration.
However, HLJDD did not alter the pharmacokinetic behaviour of verapamil
after intravenous administration. Norverapamil formation showed
biphasic kinetics in both intestinal and hepatic microsomes. HLJDD
treatment significantly decreased the intrinsic clearance of verapamil
in intestinal microsomes, but had no effect on the hepatic metabolism
of verapamil. Berberine also inhibited norverapamil formation in both
intestinal and hepatic microsomes; the extent of inhibition was larger
in intestinal microsomes.
Conclusions HLJDD displayed a route-dependent effect on the
pharmacokinetics of verapamil in rats. HLJDD treatment increased the
bioavailability of verapamil partly via inhibiting first-pass
verapamil metabolism in the intestine.

AB Fungal invasion is a main factor leading to the loss of postharvest
herbs during storage. To prevent fungal invasion and clarify the
favorable conditions for the stability of herbs during the storage
period, uniform design and three-dimensional response surfaces were
applied to investigate the relationship of the mildew degree of Radix
Ophiopogonis induced by prevalent fungal isolates and the storage
factors including air relative humidity (X-1), temperature (X-2), and

evaluated by ergosterol assay of mold isolates through a
high-performance liquid chromatography diode array detector
(HPLC-DAD) technique. As a result, storage conditions, which satisfied
the following correlation equations established by the relationships
between the storage factors and the biomass of mildew (Y), could

TI A simple adhesion assay for studying interactions between platelets
and endothelial cells in vitro
SO CYTOTECHNOLOGY
AB Cell adhesion plays a key role during various physiological and
pathological processes. Many studies have been performed to understand
the interaction of platelets with endothelial cells (ECs) during the
past decades. Modulation of their interaction has been shown to be
therapeutically useful in thrombotic diseases. Some methods of
labeling platelets such as counting and radiolabeling have been applied
in the study of the platelets-ECs interaction, but these methods did
not obtain full approval. A rapid, simple and sensitive assay for
platelets-ECs interaction was developed in this paper. Platelets were
labeled with Sudan Black B (SBB) before adding to confluent ECs
monolayer. Non-adherent platelets were removed by washing with PBS.
The adherent platelets were lysed with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and
the absorbance was recorded at 595 nm by spectrophotometer. A linear
correlation was observed between the absorbance of SBB and the number
of platelets. By employing the SBB method, the influence of heparin
on platelets-ECs interactions was observed. Heparin (3-100 units/mL)
obviously reduced platelets adhering to ECs in a
concentration-dependent manner.

TI Recent Advances in the Research and Development of B-Raf Inhibitors
SO CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Oncogenic B-Raf has been identified in a variety of cancers with high
incidence, especially in malignant melanoma and thyroid cancer. Most
B-Raf mutations elicit elevated kinase activity and the constitutive
activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which induces proliferation and
promotes malignant transformation. Therefore, B-Raf inhibitors,
targeting B-Raf or mutated B-Raf, have received increasing momentum
in oncology drug discovery arena. This review focuses on the diverse
small-molecule inhibitors of B-Raf kinase recently reported in the
literature, including those currently in clinical and preclinical
phase. They are described as two categories, type I or type II kinase
inhibitors, based on their different mechanism of action with active
or inactive conformations of the B-Raf kinase derived from the
available crystal structures or molecular docking analysis. A
particular emphasis is placed on their binding modes and the
structure-activity relationship (SAR) of each chemical structure
class.

TI ProBDNF inhibits infiltration of ED1+macrophages after spinal cord
injury
SO BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY
AB The central nervous system (CNS) does not regenerate partly clue to
the slow clearance of debris from the degenerated myelin sheath by
Wallerian degeneration. The mechanism underlying the inefficiency in
myelin clearance is not clear. Here we showed that endogenous proBDNF
may inhibit the infiltration of ED1+ inflammatory cells after spinal
cord injury. After injury, proBDNF and its receptors sortilin and
p75NTR are expressed in the spinal cord as determined by Western blots
and immunocytochemistry. ProBDNF and mature BDNF were released from
macrophages in vitro. Macrophages in vivo (ED1+) and isolated in vitro
(CD11b+) express moderate levels of proBDNF, sortilin and p75NTR.
ProBDNF suppressed the migration of isolated macrophages in vitro and
the antibody to proBDNF enhanced the migration. Suppression of proBDNF
in vivo by administering the antiserum to the prodomain of BDNF after
spinal cord injury (SCI) increased the infiltration of macrophages and
increased number of neurons in the injured cord. BBB tests showed that
the treatment of the antibody to proBDNF improved the functional
recovery after spinal cord injury. Our data suggest that proBDNF is
a suppressing factor for macrophage migration and infiltration and may
play a detrimental role after SCI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

mixoploids in Dioscorea zingiberensis
SO PHARMACOGNOSY MAGAZINE
AB This article describes an efficient colchicine-mediated technique for
the in vitro induction of tetraploids in Dioscorea zingiberensis and
its confirmation by flow cytometry. Buds immersed in 0.2% colchicine
solution for 36 hours prior to culture induced as high as 35.6%
tetraploid plants. Colchicine-induced tetraploids remained stable
after six months in soil. Leaf characteristics of diploids and
tetraploids in D. zingiberensis were compared. It was determined that
the leaf sizes of glasshouse-grown plants and stomatal sizes of both
in vitro and glasshouse-grown plants were suitable parameters for
identifying putative tetraploids in D. zingiberensis. Besides
generating tetraploids, this technique generated mixoploids in D.
zingiberensis. Calli derived from mixoploid leaves were induced to form
buds and shoots. Individual shoots were classed as diploid, mixoploid,
and tetraploid by flow cytometry. This callus-based technique could
be employed when a genome-doubling agent generated mixoploids, but no
tetraploids.

TI Homoisoflavonoids from the Fibrous Roots of Polygonatum odoratum with
Glucose Uptake-Stimulatory Activity in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes
SO JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS
AB The EtOAc-soluble fraction of a 90% MeOH extract of the fibrous roots
of Polygonatum ocloratum was found to potentiate insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Bioassay-guided
fractionation yielded nine homoisoflavonoids (1-9), four of which were
new (1-4), together with an isoflavone glycoside (10) and a flavanone
glycoside (11). The structures of new compounds were elucidated on the
basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and the absolute
configurations were deduced by CD spectra. All 11 compounds showed
effects of sensitizing adipocytes for insulin in a cell-based glucose
uptake assay using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The results indicate that
homoisoflavonoids may be potential insulin sensitizers.

TI Effect and mechanism of AR-6 in experimental rheumatoid arthritis
SO CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB The root of Clematis chinensis Osbeck has been used widely in rheumatoid
arthritis in Chinese traditional medicine and AR-6 is a triterpene
saponin isolated from it. In this present study, we investigated in
vivo effects of oral AR-6 in chronic rat adjuvant-induced arthritis
(AA) and in vitro effect in macrophage and synoviocytes cells.
Arthritic scores and serum inflammatory mediators were evaluated 19
days after AA induction by endermic injection of Freund's complete
adjuvant in Sprague-Dawley(S-D) rats. Oral administration of AR-6 to
arthritic rats resulted in a clear decrease of clinical signs compared
to untreated controls. The synoviocyte and macrophage response ex vivo
were then analyzed. Anti-arthritic effects of AR-6 correlated with
significant decrease of NO and TNF-alpha produced by peritoneal
macrophages, ex vivo and in vitro. AR-6 also significant decreased the
proliferation of synoviocyte. These data indicate that AR-6 is a
potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic and preventive agent.

TI Metabonomic profiling of diet-induced hyperlipidaemia in a rat model
SO BIOMARKERS
AB This study describes the metabolic profiles of the development of
hyperlipidaemia in a rat model, utilizing metabonomics by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) determination coupled with
multivariate statistical analysis. Rat plasma samples were collected
before and during a high-lipid diet at days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28, and
were analysed for lipid levels using kit assays or metabonomics using
GC-MS. Forty-one endogenous metabolites were separated, identified and
quantified using GC-MS. The data matrix was processed by principal
component analysis or partial least squares discriminant analysis.
Dynamic modification of the rat metabonome can be clearly identified
and tracked at different stages of hyperlipidaemia in the rat model.
Potential biomarkers, including beta-hydroxybutyrate, tyrosine and
creatinine, were identified. The current work suggests that
metabonomics is able to provide an overview of biochemical profiles
of disease progress in animal models. Using a metabonomic approach to
identify physiopathological states promises to establish a new
methodology for the early diagnosis of human diseases.</.

TI Determination of main components and anaerobic rumen digestibility of

SO WATER RESEARCH
AB A near-infrared-reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy-based method is
established to determine the main components of aquatic plants as well
as their anaerobic rumen biodegradability. The developed method is more
rapid and accurate compared to the conventional chemical analysis and
biodegradability tests. Moisture, volatile solid, Klason lignin and
ash in entire aquatic plants could be accurately predicted using this
method with coefficient of determination (r(2)) values of 0.952, 0.916,
0.939 and 0.950, respectively. In addition, the anaerobic rumen
biodegradability of aquatic plants, represented as biogas and methane
yields, could also be predicted well. The algorithm of continuous
wavelet transform for the NIR spectral data pretreatment is able to
greatly enhance the robustness and predictive ability of the NIR
spectral analysis. These results indicate that NIR spectroscopy could
be used to predict the main components of aquatic plants and their
anaerobic biodegradability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI Therapeutic Effect of the Saponin Fraction from Clematis chinensis
Osbeck Roots on Osteoarthritis Induced by Monosodium Iodoacetate
through Protecting Articular Cartilage
SO PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of
the saponin fraction from Clematis chinensis Osbeck roots (SFC) on an
osteoarthritis model in rats and to explore its underlying mechanisms.
Osteoarthritis was induced by intraarticular injection of monosodium
iodoacetate (MIA) into knee joints of rats, and SEC and diclofenac were
orally administered once a day for 28 consecutive days. Joint swelling,
macroscopic observation, histological assessment and proteoglycan
(PG) degradation were examined. In vitro, cultured rabbit chondrocytes
were stimulated with MIA and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), respectively.
The effects of SFC on MIA- and SNP-induced chondrocyte injury were
examined by MTT assay. It was shown that SFC (50, 100, 200 mg/kg)
dose-dependently reduced cartilage injury and PG degradation induced
by MIA. Diclofenac (4 mg/kg) only slightly alleviated cartilage injury
and PG degradation. SFC also prevented SNP- or MIA-induced rabbit
chondrocyte impairment. These results indicate that SEC is effective
in ameliorating joint destruction and cartilage erosion in MIA-induced
osteoarthritic in rats, and the mechanisms of action for protecting
articular cartilage are through preventing extracellular matrix
degradation and chondrocyte injury. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley &

TI Novobiocin Decreases SMYD3 Expression and Inhibits the Migration of
MDA-MB-231 Human Breast Cancer Cells
SO IUBMB LIFE
AB SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3) is a histone
methyltransferase that plays an important role in transcriptional
regulation in human carcinogenesis, and heat-shock protein HSP90A has
been shown to increase the activity of SMYD3. We previously reported
that overexpression of SMYD3 stimulated the migration of cells. In this
study, we further found that novobiocin, a HSP90 inhibitor, could
decrease the expression of SMYD3 and dose dependently inhibit the
proliferation and migration of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.
As a control, the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting SMYD3 gene also
showed similar effects with novobicin. This study is the first to show
that novobiocin can inhibit the migration of breast cancer cells and
such event may involve the downregulation of SMYD3. These findings
might throw light on the development of novel therapeutic approaches
to human cancers, and lend further understanding to the potential role
of SMYD3 in human carcinogenesis. (C) 2009 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 62(3):

TI Investigation on the isoform selectivity of histone deacetylase

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB A three dimensional (3D) chemical feature based pharmacophore model
was developed for selective histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) inhibitors,
which provides an efficient way to discuss the isoform selectivity of
HDAC inhibitors. In contrast to the classical pan-HDAC pharmacophore,
two hydrophobic features (HY and HYAr2) were found in the chemical
feature based pharmacophore model, which might be responsible for the
selectivity of HDAC1 inhibitions. Molecular docking also highlighted
the two hydrophobic features, which are located in the internal cavity
adjacent to the active site. The results contribute to our
understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the selectivity
of HDAC1 inhibitors and suggest a possible target region to design novel

Different from linear polysaccharides, the use of branched
polysaccharides as chiral selectors in CE has not been reported
previously. In this study glycogen belonging to the class of branched
polysaccharides was used as a novel chiral selector for the
enantiomeric separations for the first time. Since glycogen is
electrically neutral, the method is applicable to ionic compounds.

have been tested to demonstrate the potential of this chiral selector
BGE and selector concentrations and buffer pH were systematically

TI Role of endothelin in the effects of isoprenaline on potassium currents
and calsequestrin 2 expression in the heart
SO CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY
AB P>1. Activation of beta-receptors may modulate potassium channels and
calcium handling proteins and serve as a basis for arrhythmogenesis.
We determined whether an endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist CPU0213
could relieve the isoprenaline-(ISO) induced changes in I-Kr and I-Ks
and calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) in the heart.
2. In isolated ventricular myocytes, the I-Kr and I-Ks currents and
expression for CASQ2, FKBP12.6, SERCA2a and ETAR were measured in the
presence of ISO and either propranolol or CPU0213.
3. In the presence of ISO, I-Kr and I-Ks currents were significantly
exaggerated and FKBP12.6, SERCA2a and CASQ2 were downregulated
together with upregulation of ETAR in the myocardium. Interestingly,
endothelin-1 was also effective in downregulating the expression of
CASQ2. These changes were partially relieved by either CPU0213 or
propranolol.
4. I-Kr and I-Ks currents can be separated into exaggerated/induced
and basic components in the presence of ISO. The former, induced by
ISO, is pathological and sensitive to either CPU0213 or propranolol.
5. Exaggerated I-Kr and I-Ks and downregulated CASQ2 by ISO are relevant
to stress-related events in which the ET pathway is actively involved.
By suppressing the ISO-exaggerated I-Kr and I-Ks and normalizing the
expression of CASQ2, endothelin receptor antagonism is likely
promising in dealing with stress-related cardiac arrhythmias.

TI Membrane-based air separation for catalytic oxidation of
isolongifolene
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Oxygen-enriched air (OEA) from membrane-based air separation has been
widely used in the industrial field in the past two decades.
Isolongifolenone, an oxygenated derivative of isolongifolene, is an
important perfume ingredient in the perfumery industry. In this paper,
the DEA produced by the membranes was employed as oxidant to convert
isolongifolene into isolongifolenone with cobaltous acetate as
catalyst. The effects of the reaction conditions on the conversion and
the yield were investigated thoroughly. It was found that the
conversion of isolongifolene increased with the oxygen concentration
of the OEA and the reaction temperature. The maximum yield was obtained
under the conditions of the oxygen concentration of 33.1% and the
temperature of 60 degrees C. Both the conversion and the yield increased
with the flux of IDEA. In addition, the solvent-free reaction process
not only facilitated the catalyst recovery, but also minimized the
effluent discharge. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Paradoxical relationship between RAVE (relative activity versus
endocytosis) values of several opioid receptor agonists and their
liability to cause dependence
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To examine the relationship between the RAVE (relative activity
versus endocytosis) values of opiate agonists and their dependence
liability by studying several potent analgesics with special profiles
in the development of physical and psychological dependence.
Methods: The effects of (-)-cis-(3R, 4S, 2'R) ohmefentanyl (F9202),
(+)-cis-(3R, 4S, 2'S) ohmefentanyl (F9204), dihydroetorphine (DHE) and
morphine on [S-35] GTP gamma S binding, forskolin-stimulated cAMP
accumulation, and receptor internalization were studied in CHO cells
stably expressing HA-tagged mu-opioid receptors (CHO-HA-MOR). cAMP
overshoot in response to the withdrawal of these compound treatments
was also tested.
Results: All four agonists exhibited the same rank order of activity
in stimulation of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding, inhibition of adenylyl
cyclase (AC) and induction of receptor internalization:
DHE>F9204>F9202> morphine. Based on these findings and the previous
in vivo analgesic data obtained from our and other laboratories, the
RAVE values of the four agonists were calculated. The rank order of
RAVE values was morphine>F9202>F9204>DHE. For the induction of cAMP
overshoot, the rank order was F9202 >= morphine>F9204 >= DHE.
Conclusion: Taken in combination with previous findings of these
compounds' liability to develop dependence, the present study suggests
that the agonist with the highest RAVE value seems to have a relatively
greater liability to develop psychological dependence relative to the
agonist with the lowest RAVE value. However, the RAVE values of these
agonists are not correlated with their probability of developing
physical dependence or inducing cAMP overshoot, a cellular hallmark
of dependence.

TI Molecular Modeling of the Interaction Between Mitoxantrone and B-DNA
SO ACTA CHIMICA SINICA
AB Molecular modeling methods have been applied to characterization of
the intercalation mode of the anticancer drug mitoxantrone (MTX) into
B-DNA fragments for controversies. The results show that there are
groove selectivity and base pairs specificity recognition between MTX
and B-DNA, MTX prefers to intercalate into DNA from the minor groove
for the base pair 5'-CG. Through analyzing the detailed energy terms
of DNA-MTX, the steric interactions, especially the electrostatic
interactions were found to be the main factors to the primary drive
of intercalation and base pairs specificity. The conformation of
MTX-DNA at the best action site shows that only a portion of the
chromophore of MTX was involved in the intercalation into DNA base pairs
and the binding of MTX to DNA was potentially enhanced by the presence
of side chains which could bind electrostatically to the phosphate
groups spreading along 3'-5' of the B-DNA.

TI The effects of the Chinese herbal medicine EMF01 on salicylate-induced
tinnitus in rats
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Aim of the study. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been reported
to successfully alleviate tinnitus. although well-controlled studies
have not been conducted. In this study, we attempted to test a TM Er
Ming Fang (EMF01) containing Rehmannia glutinosa, Cornus officinalis,
Salvia mittiorrhiza, Pueraria, Schisandra chinensis, Porto cocos and
Platycodon grandiflorum, on salicylate-induced tinnitus in rats, using
a conditioned lick suppression paradigm
Materials and methods. A pilot study examined the effect of 8.75 g/kg
and 17.5 g/kg EMF01 (delivered by oral gavage for 20 days) and showed
a slight decrease in the suppression ratio (SR) in the 8 75 g/kg group
In order to confirm the possible effect of EMF01 on [Humus at 8 75 g/kg,
a further study was carried out with a larger sample size
Results While there were statistically significant differences between
the treatment groups, post hoc tests revealed that EMF01 did not have
any significant effect on salicylate-induced tinnitus
Conclusions While this study does not support the efficacy of EMF01
in the treatment of salicylate-induced tinnitus, further studies
should be conducted to determine if it alleviates tinnitus associated
with acoustic trauma (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved

TI Vaccination with a potent DNA vaccine targeting B-cell epitopes of hGRP
induces prophylactic and therapeutic antitumor activity in vivo
SO GENE THERAPY
AB Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a bombesin-like peptide, is an
autocrine or paracrine growth factor that can stimulate the growth of
various cancer cells, making it an ideal target antigen to develop
vaccines against cancer. In this study, we developed a novel DNA vaccine
that encodes six tandem repeats of B-cell epitope GRP(18-27) (GRP6)
flanked by HSP65 as carrier and four tandem repeats of mycobacterial
HSP70(407-426) (M4) as helper T-cell epitopes for enhancement of
immunogenicity. When intramuscularly immunized to mice, this anti-GRP
DNA vaccine-induced GRP-specific antibody ( Ab) responses that were
at least 10-fold higher in magnitude compared with HSP65-GRP6 protein
vaccine. Both prophylactic and therapeutic antitumor immunities
induced by vaccination significantly suppressed the growth of
GRP-dependent prostate carcinoma RM-1 in vivo and prolonged the
survival of tumor-inoculated mice. Out results also showed that the
immune sera with high titer of GRP-specific Abs effectively inhibited
the growth of tumor in mice and dose dependently inhibited
proliferation of cultured RM-1 cells in vitro, suggesting that the GRP
neutralizing Ab is responsible for the protective and therapeutic
antitumor activity of vaccination. These findings may be of great
importance in the further exploration of the applications of growth
factors identified in human in cancer therapy. Gene Therapy (2010) 17,

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB A method based on solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry for the simultaneous determination of 76 veterinary
drugs in foodstuffs of animal origin was presented. The residues
derived from pork, shrimp, milk, liver and egg were extracted by
acetonitrile combined with citrate buffer containing magnesium cation.
The extracts were distilled and redissolved with citrate buffer
followed by a further cleanup procedure using polymer connected with
cation exchange SPE column. The residues retained in column were rinsed
with methanol and mixture of methanol and ammonium hydroxide (95:5,
V/V). Sample matrix-matched calibration was used to determine the
residue contents by external standard. The method provided a LOQ of
0.5 mu g/kg (beta-agonist and triphenylmethane), 1.0 mu g/kg
(benzodiazepine and nitroimdazole), 5.0 mu g/kg( benzimidazole) and
20.0 mu g/kg( sulfanilamide), linear relationship more than 0.907 and
a recovery ranged from 59.4% to 115.3% with a RSD between 2.6% and 27.3%
in sample matrix. The practical inspection using the method offered
two positive samples for ractopamine and diazepam with a residual

TI Enzymatic degradation products from a marine polysaccharide YCP with
different immunological activity and binding affinity to macrophages,
hydrolyzed by alpha-amylases from different origins
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB YCP is a marine polysaccharide with anti-tumor and immune-modulating
effects. This study evaluated the effect of enzymatic degradation of
YCP by alpha-amylases from different origins on its immunological
activity and binding ability to the macrophages. YCP was hydrolyzed
by alpha-amylases isolated from Aspergillus oryzae, Bacillus
licheniformis, Barley malt, and Porcine pancreas respectively, then
four fragments with unique molecular weight (termed: YCP-Ao, YCP-Bl,
YCP-Bm, and YCP-Pp, respectively) were obtained. The four fragments
showed different immunological activity and the ability to bind to
macrophages. Among them, YCP-Ao possessed almost equivalent
immunological activity compared to the original YCP, while such
properties were not retained in YCP-Bl. Our further study showed that
YCP-Ao prevented YCP from binding to macrophages. In conclusion, YCP-Ao
and YCP might have similar active regions. Crown Copyright (C) 2009

SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB This paper describes a novel method that combines dansyl chloride
(DNS-CL) derivatization with high-performance liquid
chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-ESI/MS/MS) for the sensitive and selective determination of
piperazine phosphate in human plasma. After addition of ondansetron
hydrochloride as internal standard (IS), piperazine phosphate was
derivatized and then extracted with ethyl acetate. After being
evaporated and reconstituted, the sample was analyzed using
LC-ESI/MS/MS. Separation was achieved using an Agilent ZORBAX SB-C-18
(150 mm x 2.1 mm I.D., 3.5 mu m) column and isocratic elution with 10
mM ammonium acetate solution (pH 3.0)-methanol (50: 50, v/v). Detection
was performed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer utilizing
electrospray ionization (ESI) interface operating in positive ion and
selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode with the precursor to product
ion transitions m/z 320 -> 171 for DNS-CL-piperazine phosphate and m/z
294 170 for the IS. The method was fully validated for its selectivity,
sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery, matrix effect
and stability. The coefficient (r) of piperazine phosphate with a
linear range of 0.1-15 mu g mL(-1) was 0.9974-0.9995. The limit of
detection and lower limit of quantification in human plasma were 0.01

SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
AB Shengmai San (SMS) has been used for the treatment of cardiovascular
disease in Asia for long-time. It has been reported that SMS can protect
against oxidative stress and tune immune response in patients. In this
paper, a high performance liquid chromatography-diode array
detection-chemiluminescence (HPLC-DAD-CL) method for on-line
detection was successfully applied to screen antioxidants in complex
SMS extracts. The H2O2 scavenging activity of every fraction of SMS
extracts was measured to evaluate each contribution to the total
anti-oxidative activities of the prescription, followed by structures
identification of the main active components by LC/MS/MS. HPLC-DAD-CL
method was also applied for comparing the scavenging rates of main
active components between the individual herbs and SMS. Interestingly,
we found that the scavenging activities of main components detected
in the individual herbs were different from those in SMS. The
experimental data indicated that drug interactions during decocting
process could result in the changes of the antioxidants' solubility.
This study demonstrated that HPLC-DAD-CL on-line assay was a useful
technique for rapidly screening and identifying bioactive components
from complex multi-herbal prescription. (C) 2010 Elsevier By. All

AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB A simple liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) method with highly improved sensitivities for
the determination of helicid in rat bile, urine, feces and most tissues
was developed. The tissues and feces were firstly homogenized
mechanically using deionized water as the media. Bile, urine, tissues
and feces homogenates were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with
n-butyl alcohol for sample preparation. The subsequent analysis
procedures were performed on a Shimadzu LCMS2010A system (electrospray
ionization single quadrupole mass analyzer). A Luna C-18 column (150
mm x 2.00 mm, 5 mu m) was used as the analytical column, while a mixture
of acetonitrile and ammonium chloride water solution was used as the
mobile phase. The proportions of mobile phase were changed timely
according to gradient programs. Chlorinated adducts of molecular ions
[M+Cl-] at m/z 319.00 and 363.05 were used to quantify helicid and
bergeninum (internal standard), respectively. The method was validated
to be accurate, precise and rugged with good linearity. The proposed
method was successfully applied to the preclinical tissue distribution
and excretion studies of helicid in rats. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

array after Evans Blue (EB) application indicated that the super-short
microneedles were able to pierce into skin by pressing and swaying
against the microneedles backing layer continually with a finger. The
micro-conduits created in skin were validated by histological
examination.
Transport studies revealed that: (i) skin pretreated with super-short
microneedles resulted in a remarkable enhancement of the galanthamine
(GAL) transport, and the permeated amount increased as the insertion
force increased; (ii) the super-short microneedles with flat tips were
better than that with sharp tips for enhancing skin permeability; (iii)
the longer time of super-short microneedles detained in skin resulted
in a higher increase of skin permeability; (iv) there was no linear
correlation between the GAL permeated through skin and the number of
microneedles. The EIIIA(+) (526 bp) segment, a very sensitive marker
of tissue injury, did not expressed in the skin pierced by super-short
microneedles. Meanwhile, the skin pretreated with super-short
microneedles did not infected after incubation with the Staphylococcus
aureus. These results suggest that super-short microneedles may be a
safe and efficient alternative for transdermal drug delivery of
hydrophilic molecules. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T Quantification of henatinib maleate, a novel potent inhibitor of VEGF
I receptors, in rat plasma by LC-MS/MS
BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
A Henatinib maleate
B (R,Z)-2[(5-fluoro-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-3H-indol-3-ylidene)
methyl]-5-(2-hydroxy-3morpholinopropy1)-3-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydr
o-1H-p yrrolo[3,2-0 azepin-4-ketone maleate is a potent inhibitor of
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and is currently under
preclinical evaluation as an anticancer drug. A novel method for the
quantification of henatinib maleate in rat plasma using high
performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry has been
developed. The analyte (henatinib maleate) and internal standard
(papaverine hydrochloride) were extracted from 50 ta of rat plasma by
protein precipitation and separated on a C-18 column using a mixture
of 25 mm ammonium acetate buffer:methanol :acetonitrile (35:50:15,
v/v/v) as mobile phase with a run time of 4.5 min. The detection was
performed by means of triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with
an ESI interface operating in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode.
A linear response was observed over the concentration range 5.0-1000
ng/mL. The limit of quantification was 5.0 ng/mL. Both intra- and
inter-day precision, defined as relative standard deviation, were
within 9.7%. Accuracy, defined as relative error, was within 3.1%. The
developed method was successfully applied to preclinical
pharmacokinetic studies of henatinib maleate in rat after a single oral
administration of the drug. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Quality assessment of Cortex Phellodendri by high-performance liquid
chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
SO BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB A simple method based on liquid chromatography coupled with diode array
detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(LC-DAD-ESI-MS) was developed for the quality assessment of Cortex
Phellodendri (CP), which was mainly derived from two species of
Phellodendron chinense Schneid and Phellodendron amurense Rupr. Total
41 compounds, including 14 phenols, 24 alkaloids and three liminoidal
triterpenes were identified or tentatively characterized from the 75%
methanol extract of CP samples by online ESI-MSn fragmentation and UV
spectra analysis. Among them, two phenols and six alkaloids were
simultaneously quantified using HPLC-DAD method. The validated
HPLC-DAD method showed a good linearity, precision, repeatability and
accuracy for the quantification of eight marker compounds.
Furthermore, the plausible fragmentation pathway of the representative
compounds were proposed in the present study. The differences of the
chemical constituents content and the comprehensive HPLC profiles
between the two CP species using LC-DAD-ESI-MS method are reported for
the first time, indicating that the CP drugs from different resources
should be used separately in the clinic. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley

TI Differential involvement of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/1D receptors in human
interferon-alpha-induced immobility in the mouse forced swimming test
SO ARZNEIMITTEL-FORSCHUNG-DRUG RESEARCH
AB Although Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha, CAS 9008-11-1) is a powerful
drug in treating several viral infections and certain tumors, a
considerable amount of neuropsychiatric side-effects such as
depression and anxiety are an unavoidable consequence. Combination
with the selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
fluoxetine (CAS 56296-78-7) significantly improved the situation.
However, the potential 5-HT1A receptor- and 5-HT1B receptor-signals
involved in the antidepressant effects are still unclear. The effects
of 5-HT1A receptor- and 5-HT1B receptor signals were analyzed by using
the mouse forced swimming test (FST), a predictive test of
antidepressant-like action. The present results indicated that (1)
fluoxetine (administrated intragastrically, 30 mg/kg; not subactive
dose: 15 mg/kg) significantly reduced IFN-alpha-induced increase of
the immobility time in the forced swimming test; (2) 5-HT1A receptorand 5-HT1B receptor ligands alone or in combination had no effects on
IFN-alpha-induced increase of the immobility time in the FST; (3)
surprisingly, WAY 100635 (5-HT1A receptor antagonist, 634908-75-1) and
8-OH-DPAT(5-HT1A receptor agonist, CAS 78950-78-4) markedly enhanced
the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine at the subactive dose (15
mg/kg, i.g.) on the IFN-alpha-treated mice in the FST. Further
investigations showed that fluoxetine combined with WAY 100635 and
8-OH-DPAT failed to produce antidepressant effects in the FST. (4)
Co-application of CGS 12066A (5-HT1B receptor agonist, CAS
109028-09-3) or GR 127935 (5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist, CAS
148642-42-6) with fluoxetine had no synergistic effects on the
IFN-alpha-induced increase of immobility time in FST. (5)
Interestingly, co-administration of GR 127935, WAY 100635 and
fluoxetine significantly reduced the IFN-alpha-induced increase in
immobility time of FST, being more effective than co-administration
of WAY 100635 and fluoxetine. All results suggest that (1) compared
to the 5-HT1B receptor, the 5-HT1A receptor signal plays the dominant
role in improving the anti-immobility effect of fluoxetine in the
IFN-alpha-induced depression; (2) combination of the 5-HT(1)A
antagonist with subactive fluoxetine can be helpful in
IFN-alpha-induced depression treatment.

TI Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence study of valacyclovir
hydrochloride capsules after single dose administration in healthy
Chinese male volunteers
SO ARZNEIMITTEL-FORSCHUNG-DRUG RESEARCH
AB The aim of the present study was to compare the bioavailability of
valacyclovir (CAS 124832-26-4; INN: valaciclovir) from two
valacyclovir hydrochloride (CAS 214832-27-5) capsules (150 mg/capsule
as test preparation and 150 mg/capsule commerciallty available
original capsule of the drug as reference preparation) in 20 Chinese
healthy male volunteers, aged between 20 and 27. The study was conducted
according to an open randomized, single blind, 2-way crossover study
design with a wash-out phase of 7 days. Blood samples for
pharmacokinetic profiling were taken up to 24 h post-dose. Valacyclovir
hydrochloride is rapidly converted to acyclovir (CAS 59277-89-3) after
oral administration, so the pharmacokinetcis and bioequivalence of
valacyclovir hydrochloride can be studied by determining the plasma
concnetratio of acyclovir. Plasma concentrations of acyclovir were
determined witha validated liquid chromatography, tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The pharmacokinetic parameters of test
and reference formulations were estimated as follows: the maximum
plasma concentrations (C-max) were 2.04 +/- 0.43 mu g mL and 2.01 +/0.50 mu g/mL; the median T-max were 1.1 +/- 0.3 h and 1.0 +/- 0.3 h;
plasma elimination half-lives (t(1/2)) were 2.94 +/- 0.42 h and 2.85
+/- 0.28 h Values of AUC(0-t) demonstrate nearly identical
bioavailability of valacyclovir hydrochloride from the examined
formulations. AUC(0-15) were 6.70 +/- 1.26 mu g.h/mL and 6.96 +/- 1.25
g.h/mL. Areas under the plasma concentration-time curve
(AUC(0-infinity)) were 6.90 +/- 1.36 mu g.h/ml and 7.15 +/- 1.31 mu
g.h/mL. Both primary target parameters , AUC(0-infinity) and AUC(0-t)
wre tested parametrically by analysis of variaance (ANOVA) and relative
bioavailabilities were 96.69 7.89% for AUC(0-infinity) , 96.40 8.0%
for AUC(0-15). Bioequivalence between test and reference preparation
was demonstated fro both parameters AUC(0-infinity) and AUC(0-t). The
90% confidence intervals of the T/R-ratios of logarithmically
transformed data were in the generally accepted range of 80-125%. It
meant that the test formualtion was bioequivalnet to the reference
formulation for valacyclovir hydrochloride.

TI Expression, Purification, and C-terminal Site-Specific PEGylation of
Cysteine-Mutated Glucagon-Like Peptide-1
SO APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is attracting increasing interest on
account of its prominent benefits in type 2 diabetes. However, its
clinical application is limited because of short biological half-life.
This study was designed to produce a C-terminal site-specific PEGylated
analog of cysteine-mutated GLP-1 (cGLP-1) to prolong its action. The
gene of cGLP-1 was inserted into pET32a to construct a thioredoxinA
fusion protein. After expression in BL21 (DE3) strain, the fusion
protein was purified with Ni-affinity chromatography and then was
PEGylated with methoxy-polyethylene glycol-maleimide
(mPEG(10K)-MAL). The PEGylated fusion protein was purified with anion
exchange chromatography and then was cleaved by enterokinase. The
digested product was further purified with reverse-phase
chromatography. Finally, 8.7 mg mPEG(10K)-cGLP-1 with a purity of up
to 98% was obtained from the original 500 ml culture. The circular
dichroism spectra indicated that mPEG(10K)-cGLP-1 maintained the
secondary structure of native GLP-1. As compared with that of native
GLP-1, the plasma glucose lowering activity of mPEG(10K)-cGLP-1 was
significantly extended. These results suggest that our method will be
useful in obtaining a large quantity of mPEG(10K)-cGLP-1 for further
study and mPEG(10K)-cGLP-1 might find a role in the therapy of type
2 diabetes through C-terminal site-specific PEGylation.

AB Luteolin, a naturally occurring polyphenol flavonoid, has demonstrated
some beneficial modulation toward the endothelium. This study aims to
investigate the effects of luteolin on lysophosphatidylcholine
(LPC)-induced apoptosis, a key event in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis, in endothelial cells. Luteolin reduced not only
LPC-induced cell death but also lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage.
Luteolin inhibition of LPC-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells
demonstrated its protection against the cytotoxicity of LPC.
LPC-induced apoptosis is characterized by a calcium-dependent
mitochondrial pathway, involving calcium influx, activation of
calpains, cytochrome C release and caspases activation. Luteolin
reduced calcium influx. It also inhibited calpains activation and
prevented the release of cytochrome C from mitochondrion. The
inhibition of cytochrome C release by luteolin blocked the activation
of caspase-3 and thus prevented subsequent endothelial cell apoptosis.
These results suggested that luteolin inhibits LPC-induced apoptosis
in endothelial cells through the blockage of the calcium-dependent
mitochondrial pathway.

TI Highly Stable Dispersibility in Water Induced by Surface Hydration
Force of TiO2 Nanocrystalline Mixtures During Phase Transformation
SO JOURNAL OF DISPERSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Titania (TiO2) nanoparticles were prepared by the alcohothermal method
using tetra-n-butyl titanate [Ti(OC4H9n)(4)] as a precursor. The phase
transformation from anatase to rutile happened when the nanoparticles
were calcined at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C in an oven,
respectively. TiO2 nanocrystalline mixtures had the highly stable
dispersibility when they were dispersed in water medium. The zeta
potentials of the different TiO2 nanoparticles showed that the surface
electrostatic forces were not crucial factors in such stable
dispersibility. Other characterizations, including x-ray diffraction
(XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), indicated
that the phase transformation was favor of the adsorption of water on
TiO2 surface. A visual model was presented to illustrate that the strong
repulsive surface hydration force prevented TiO2 nanoparticles from
aggregation.

TI Synthesis of 1-Octadecanol-Modified Water-Swelling Polyurethane
Hydrogels as Vaginal Drug-Delivery Vehicle
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION
AB The purpose of this work was to develop a novel polyurethane hydrogel
system for sustained drug release, which could be used as a vaginal
drug-delivery vehicle. The blank polyurethane hydrogels were
synthesized by a polyol oligomeric, a diisocyanate and a triol (used
as cross-linking agent). In order to improve the swelling ability of
a polyurethane hydrogel, a small amount of 1-octadecanol was added.
Additionally, the structure, mechanical properties and thermal
properties of polymers were assessed by FT-IR, WAXD, DSC and mechanical
tests. The results show that no more than 2.5 wt% of 1-octadecanol
additives is sufficient to affect the release profile without changing
the structure and mechanical properties of the polyurethane hydrogels
obviously. Tinidazole was chosen as a model drug, the release data of
drug from polyurethane hydrogels were fitted using the Ritger-Peppas
equation and the result showed that it was non-Fickian diffusion, which
means that the drug release was controlled by both swollen control and
diffusion control. In conclusion, our work proves that the synthesized
polyurethane hydrogel modified by 1-octadecanol may be a promising
sustained release drug carrier. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010

TI Anti-Diabetic Agents from Natural Products-An Update from 2004 to 2009
SO CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB Diabetes mellitus (DM), the third killer of the mankind health along
with cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, is one of
the most challenging diseases facing health care professionals today.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that a DM epidemic
is underway. Primary DM and its complications are costly to manage,
not only for affected individuals, but also for healthcare systems
around the world. Screening of anti-diabetic agents has been
extensively investigated in the past decades. Natural products (NPs)
have served as a major source of drugs for centuries, and about half
of the pharmaceuticals in use today are derived from natural
substances. Many natural products especially plants-derived medicines
have been recommended for the treatment of DM. The present paper reviews
NPs appeared in the literature with potential for DM and also identifies
the research needs in this area. It mainly covers the time period from
January 2004 to June 2009. The current review is divided into three
major sections based on classification of the natural materials
involved. The first part focuses on known and some new chemical entities
isolated mainly from medicinal plants possessing anti-diabetic
properties, including saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids,
anthraquinones, terpenes, coumarins, phenolics, polysaccharides, and
some other compounds. The second part summarizes crude extract of
medicinal plants which are commonly used in the traditional Chinese
medical system and have been demonstrated experimental or/and clinical
anti-diabetic effectiveness, mainly including Leguminosae,
Cucurbitaceae, Araliaceae, Liliaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Solanaceae,
Compositae, Campanulaceae, Cornaceae, Rhamnaceae, Scrophulariaceae,
Euphorbiaceae, Ginkgoceae, Gramineae, Myrtaceae, Sterculiaceae,
Annonaceae, Labiatae, Crassulaceae, and Miscellaneous. The third part
lists some compound formulae consisting of extracts of several plants
that have been reported as beneficial for the treatment of DM, major
involving Xiaokeling tablet, Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Decoction,
Ba-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan and Formula 1.

Phosphorylase
SO CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY
AB Recently, oleanolic acid was found to be an inhibitor of glycogen
phosphorylase. For further structural modification, we have
synthesized several dimers of oleanolic acid by using amide, ester,
or triazole linkage with click chemistry. The click chemistry was shown
to be the most efficient method for the dimer synthesis. Nearly
quantitative yield of triazole-linked dimers was obtained. Biological
evaluation of the synthesized dimers as inhibitors of glycogen
phosphorylase has been described. Four of six dimers exhibited
inhibitory activity against rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase a
(RMGPa), with compounds 2 and 7 as the most potent inhibitors, which
displayed an IC50 value (ca. 3 mu M) lower than that of oleanolic acid
(IC50=14 mu M).

TI Combined effects of epileptic seizure and phenobarbital induced
overexpression of P-glycoprotein in brain of chemically kindled rats
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Background and purpose:
The multidrug resistance of epilepsy may result from the overexpression
of P-glycoprotein, but the mechanisms are unclear. We investigated
whether the overexpression of P-glycoprotein in the brains of subjects
with pharmacoresistant epilepsy resulted from both drug effects and
seizure activity.
Experimental approach:
Kindled rats were developed by injecting a subconvulsive dose of
pentylenetetrazole (33 mg center dot kg-1 center dot day-1, i.p.) for
28 days. Groups were then treated with an oral dose of phenobarbital
(45 mg center dot kg-1 center dot day-1) for 40 days. In accord with
behavioural observations, P-glycoprotein activity in brain was
assessed using brain-to-plasma concentration ratios of rhodamine 123.
P-glycoprotein levels in the brain regions were further evaluated using
RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The distribution of phenobarbital
in the brain was assessed by measuring phenobarbital concentrations
1 h following its oral administration.
Key results:
The kindling significantly increased P-glycoprotein activity and
expression. Good associations were found among P-glycoprotein
activity, expression and phenobarbital concentration in the
hippocampus. Short-term treatment with phenobarbital showed good
anti-epileptic effect; the maximum effect occurred on day 14 when
overexpression of P-glycoprotein was reversed. Continuous treatment
with phenobarbital had a gradually reduced anti-epileptic effect and
on day 40, phenobarbital exhibited no anti-epileptic effect; this was
accompanied by both a re-enhancement of P-glycoprotein expression and
decreased phenobarbital concentration in the hippocampus.
P-glycoprotein function and expression were also increased in
age-matched normal rats treated with phenobarbital.
Conclusions and implications:
The overexpression of P-glycoprotein in the brain of subjects with
pharmacoresistant epilepsy is due to a combination of drug effects and
epileptic seizures.

TI Impact of VKORC1 gene polymorphism on interindividual and interethnic
warfarin dosage requirement- A systematic review and meta analysis
SO THROMBOSIS RESEARCH
AB Introduction: Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant. It
has been suggested that anticoagulation effect of warfarin is
significantly associated with the polymorphism of certain genes,
including Cytochrome P450 complex subunit 2C9 (CYP2C9), Vitamin K
Epoxide Reductase Complex Subunit 1 (VKORC1), Gamma-Glutamyl
Carboxylase (GGCX) and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) etc. The purpose of the
present study was to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis to
investigate the relationship between mean daily warfarin dose (MDWD)
and VKORC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
Materials and Methods: Inclusion and exclusion criteria were made, and
the studies between 2004 and present were searched. References were
examined, and experts were consulted for additional information. Data
were extracted. Revman 4.2.10 software was applied to analyze the
relationship between MDWD and VKORC1 SNPs.
Results: Total 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The
frequencies of 1173TT and -1639 AA in Asian patients were higher than
those in Caucasian and African populations. Patients with VKORC1 1173
CT and 1173 CC required 44% [95% Confidence Interval (CI); 32%, 56%]
and 97% [73%, 122%] higher MDWD than 1173 TT carriers, -1639GA and
-1639GG carriers required 52% [41%, 64%] and 102% [85%, 118%] higher
MDWD than -1639AA carriers, 3730GA and 3730AA carriers required 27%
[3%, 58%] and 52% [3%, 109%] higher MDWD than 3730GG carriers. In
addition, 1173C, -1639 G and 3730 A carriers required 63% [44%, 82%],
61% [49%, 73%] and 32% [4%, 59%] higher MDWD than 1173TT, -1639 AA and
3730GG, respectively. Sensitive analyses demonstrated that the impacts
of gene polymorphism on warfarin dosage requirement were significantly
different between Caucasian and Asian population, and the results of
meta-analyses were stable and reliable.
Conclusion: This is the first meta-analysis about the impact of VKORC1
gene polymorphism on warfarin dose requirement. Our studies showed that
gene polymorphisms of VKORC1 significantly associated with the
variation of interindividual warfarin dose requirement variation, and
the effects are different in ethnicities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

TI Hospital pharmacists' knowledge and opinions regarding adverse drug
reaction reporting in Northern China
SO PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
AB Purpose This study was designed to investigate the knowledge and
opinions of hospital pharmacists about the spontaneous reporting of
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in Inner Mongolia, a nor-them region of
China.
Methods A face-to-face questionnaire survey of hospital pharmacists
was conducted in five tertiary general hospitals in Inner Mongolia
between July and December 2007. The structured questionnaire consisted
of questions about the demographic details of the pharmacists, their
knowledge of pharmacovigilance and their opinions on pharmacists'
involvement in ADR reporting.
Results Of the 288 pharmacists visited, 246 responded giving a total
response rate of 85.4%. An amount of 70% of the pharmacists could define
ADR correctly and 78.0% knew how to report ADRs. However, only one-third
were clear as to what should be reported. The majority of pharmacists
(92.7%) considered ADR reporting to be a professional obligation.
However, only 36 (14.6%) claimed to have reported an ADR in their
career, 25 of these 36 pharmacists (69.4%) were clinical pharmacists.
Younger pharmacists and those who had received ADR training were more
likely to report an ADR. The three major reasons for not reporting were:
uncertain association (81.9%), insufficient clinical knowledge
(68.6%) and lack of time (45.7%). The most frequently mentioned
suggestion for improvement included more education on ADR reporting
(66.7%), participation in ward rounds (43.9%) and encouragement from
the pharmacy department (32.9%).
Conclusion Our investigation showed hospital pharmacists in it
northern region of China had a reasonable knowledge of and positive
attitudes towards pharmacovigilance. However, the majority of
pharmacists had never reported an ADR in their career. Pharmacists'
ADR education and increasing involvement in patient care would be
important in improving ADR reporting in hospitals. Copyright (C) 2009

TI A New Method for Synthesis of Nolatrexed Dihydrochloride
SO ORGANIC PROCESS RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
AB A new synthetic method for nolatrexed dihydrochloride (thymitaq) has
been developed. The synthesis was accomplished in three steps featuring
the direct conversion of the starting 4-bromo-5-methylisatin into the
methyl anthranilate by potassium peroxydisulfate/sodium methoxide. In
the final Ullmann reaction potassium carbonate was employed in place
of sodium hydride, and the amount of copper catalysts was significantly
reduced. Moreover, sodium sulfide solution was utilized to efficiently
remove copper under approximately neutral conditions instead of
hydrogen sulfide/methanol under strongly acidic conditions. By means
of these modifications, nolatrexed dihydrochloride was ensured to be
prepared in good yield and high purity.

TI Heparin: an intervenor in cell communication
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB Introduction
Effects of heparin beyond anticoagulant
Non-anticoagulant heparins
Cells adhere to communicate
Anti-adhesion activity of heparin
Heparin and cell adhesion molecules
Heparin binds to messengers in cell communication
What makes cells sticky?
Heparin and heparanase
Conclusion
It was nearly 100 years since heparin was discovered, but the role of
this widely used anticoagulant is still remarkably thought provoking
now. During pathological processes such as atherosclerosis,
inflammation, cancer and infection, phenomena of cell adhesion are
ubiquitous and complicated. Heparin exerts anti-adhesion activity
appearing as a common mechanism of its potential polypharmacology in
those diseases. Furthermore, heparin can bind a variety of signalling
molecules such as growth factors, cell surface proteins of pathogens
and most notably, cell adhesion molecules. These signalling molecules
are involved in cell communication, acting as ligands, receptors and
second messengers. Considering that heparan sulphate
glycosaminoglycan is increasingly recognized as a key mediator in many
cellular processes, the structural similarity with heparan sulphate
suggests that heparin is a multifunctional intervenor in cell
communication.

TI Oroxylin A inhibits angiogenesis through blocking vascular endothelial
growth factor-induced KDR/Flk-1 phosphorylation
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB In this study, we examined the antiangiogenic effect of oroxylin A in
vitro and in vivo and explored the potential mechanisms for this effect.
Transwell assay and tube formation assay were used to evaluate the
effects of oroxylin A on vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)-induced migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs). Rat aortic ring assay was also employed
to assess the effect of oroxylin A on microvessel outgrowth from rat
aorta. Human tumor xenografts model in nude mice was further used to
investigate the antiangiogenic activity of oroxylin A in vivo. Western
blot analysis was used to investigate the related mechanism.
Oroxylin A remarkably suppressed the VEGF-stimulated migration and
tube formation of HUVECs. It also inhibited microvessel sprouting from
rat aortic ring in vitro. In addition, it suppressed the angiogenesis
of xenograft tumor in nude mice, which concurred with the inhibition
of tumor growth. Moreover, oroxylin A blocked VEGF-induced
phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 and related downstream signaling
molecules, including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase,
extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt.
Oroxylin A possessed antiangiogenic activities in vitro and in vivo,
which could be an underlying mechanism of its anticancer effect.

TI Effects of Sulfation on the Physicochemical and Functional Properties
of a Water-Insoluble Polysaccharide Preparation from Ganoderma lucidum
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB The sulfation of a water-insoluble Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide
(GLP) was successfully carried out with chlorosulfonic acid-pyridine
in dimethyl formamide to prepare three sulfated GLP derivatives, named
sGLP1, sGLP2, and sGLP3. The chemical structure of the sulfated GLIP
was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and C-13 NMR analyses. The
sGLPs were evaluated for their water solubility, degree of substitution
(DS), antioxidant properties, and bile acid-binding capacities. The
results showed that sulfation improved the water solubility of GLP and
increased its scavenging capacities against hydroxyl and superoxide
anion radicals, hydrogen peroxide-scavenging activity, Fe(II)
chelating ability, reducing power, and bile acid-binding capacities.
It was also observed that the DS may influence the physicochemical and
functional properties of sGLPs. For instance, the sulfated GLP with
the lowest DS had the greatest bile acid-binding capacity, and the sGLP
that had the highest DS showed the lowest bile acid-binding ability
under the experimental conditions. The results from this study
suggested that sulfation is a possible approach to obtain novel
water-soluble derivatives of GLP with improved physicochemical,
functional, and biological properties for potential utilization in
functional foods or supplemental products.

tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to understand the binding
affinities of thiolactomycin (TLM) analogs for mtFabH based on 3D
quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) analysis and
molecular docking studies. The 3D-QSAR models produced statistically
significant results (comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) r2

analysis (CoMSIA) r2 cv = 0.625, r<SU2</SU = 0.969) with 40 TLM analogs.
In particular, compounds possessing hydrogen bond acceptors attached
to the end of side chains at the C5 position of TLM analogs may enhance
their activity. The results of 3D-QSAR models were further compared
with structure-based analysis using docking studies with the crystal
structure of mtFabH. A plausible binding mode between TLM analogs and
mtFabH is proposed.</.

AB Gambogic acid (GA), a promising anticancer candidate, is a
polyprenylated xanthone abundant in the resin of Garcinia morella and
Garcinia hanburyi. The major circulating metabolite of CA in human,
10-hydroxygambogic acid (10-OHGA), was identified by comparison of the
retention time and mass spectra with those of reference standard using
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The reference
standard of 10-OHGA was isolated from bile samples of rats after
intravenous injection of GA injection, and its structure was confirmed
by NMR. Then, a selective and sensitive method was developed for the
quantitative determination of this metabolite in human plasma. After
liquid-liquid extraction by ethyl acetate, the analyte and the internal
standard were separated on a Sepax HPC18 column (100mm x 2.1 mm i.d.,
3.0 mu m) with a mobile phase of 10mM ammonium acetate water solution
containing 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile (20:80, v/v). The detection
was performed on a single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with
electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The calibration curve was linear
over the range of 3-2000ng/mL for 10-OHGA. The developed quantification
method can now be used for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological
Studies of 10-OHGA after intravenous infusion of CA injection in human.

electrokinetic chromatography
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB To date, a series of chiral selectors have been utilized successfully
in capillary electrophoresis (CE) Among these Various chiral
selectors, macrocyclic antibiotics have been demonstrated to represent
powerful enantioselectivity towards many chiral compounds. Differing
from macrocyclic antibiotics, the use of lincosamide antibiotics as
chiral selectors has not been reported previously. In our recent work,
clindamycin phosphate belonging to the group of lincosamides has been
first used as a chiral selector in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)
In this paper, a micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method
has been developed for the evaluation of enantioseparation capability
of this novel chiral selector towards several racemic basic drugs As
observed during the Course of this work, clindamycin phosphate allowed
excellent separation of the enantiomers of nefopam, citalopram,
tryptophan, chlorphenamine, propranolol and metoprolol, as well as
partial enantioresolution of tryptophan methyl ester and cetirizine
In this MEKC chiral separation system, different types of anionic
surfactants. organic additives and background electrolytes were
tested. and satisfactory enantioseparations of basic drugs
above-mentioned were achieved using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as
the surfactant, isopropanol as the organic additive, and phosphate as
the background electrolyte Furthermore, both migration times and
enantioseparation of the analytes were influenced by several
experimental parameters such as pH of the BGE, clindamycin phosphate
and SDS concentrations, phosphate and isopropanol concentrations, and
applied voltage Consequently, the effects of these factors on
enantioseparations of the studied basic drugs were systematically
investigated in order to evaluate the stereoselectivity of clindamycin
phosphate in MEKC (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

TI The fusion protein of HSP65 with tandem repeats of beta-hCG acting as
a potent tumor vaccine in suppressing hepatocarcinoma
SO INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB It has been demonstrated that the beta-subunit of human chorionic
gonadotropin (beta-hCG) is ectopically expressed on a variety of human
cancers of different histological types and has been used as an
antigenic target in anti-cancer vaccines. We engineered a fusion
protein by fusing 10 tandemly repeated copies of the 10-residue
sequence of beta-hCG (109-118) (in CTP37) combined with beta-hCG
C-terminal 37 peptides to mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 and
immunized mice via subcutaneous injection. Humoral immune and cellular
immune responses were effectively elicited. High titer of
anti-beta-hCG antibody was detected in immunized mice sera by ELISA
and verified by Western blot analyses. The fusion protein of
HSP65-X10-beta-hCGCTP37 effectively inhibited the growth of tumor both
protective and therapeutic anti-tumor immunity in hepatocellular
carcinoma tumor models in mice. Meanwhile, it also attenuated
tumor-induced angiogenesis in intradermal tumor model in mice. Taken
together, these results demonstrate that immune responses are
effectively induced by a novel fusion protein vaccine targeting
beta-hCG, suppressing the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.
The beta-hCG-targeted vaccine holds promise for the treatment of a
number of cancers and merits further study. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

bioconversion yields, and starting pH and time were also major factors
affecting the product yield. Under optimal conditions, the yield of
nocathiacin acid was increased from 10.4 mg/L to greater than 45.0 mg/L
after 6 days of fermentation. The use of protease inhibitors indicated
that enzymes such as peptidylglycine monooxygenase and alcylase I are
likely involved in the bioconversion. This is the first report on the
generation of nocathiacin acid through microbial conversion in situ.
Compared to chemical methods, the present approach is more effective
and could be broadly applied in the production of novel derivatives
of microbial secondary metabolites. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

TI Hybrid Molecules from Xanomeline and Tacrine: Enhanced Tacrine Actions
on Cholinesterases and Muscarinic M-1 Receptors
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB A set of amide- and amine-linked hybrid molecules comprising moieties
of the orthosteric M-1 muscarinic receptor agonist xanomeline and the
cholinesterase inhibitor and allosteric receptor modulator tacrine
were prepared with varying spacer length of 10-17 atoms. The hybrids
inhibited acetylcholinesterase with similar or higher potency compared
to tacrine. M, receptor binding affinity was similar or higher relative
to xanomeline and far higher relative to tacrine. Affinities hardly
changed when the receptors' orthosteric site was Occupied by all
inverse agonist ligand. When Occupied by the orthosteric activator
acetylcholine, affinity for the hybrids declined to unmeasureably low
levels. Hybrids did not activate M-1 receptors. In vivo studies
assaying cognition impairment in rats induced by scopolamine revealed
pronounced enhancement of scopolamine action. Taken together, instead
of dualsteric (simultaneous allosteric/orthosteric) binding, the
hybrids seem to prefer purely allosteric binding at the inactive M-1
receptor.

AB In this paper, beta-glucosidase hydrolysis approach was applied on
Osmanthus fragrans Lour. flowers for the aroma enhancement of the
extract. The hydrolysis and extraction conditions, including enzyme
amount, temperature, time, rate of agitation, buffer pH, buffer volume,
extraction time, extraction temperature and petroleum ether volume,
were optimized. The crude extract (concrete) and refined extract
(absolute) under optimum conditions had increased yields of 0.42% and
0.25%, which were 147.1% and 177.8%, respectively, as compared with
the procedure without the beta-glucosidase hydrolysis. Analyses showed
no obvious qualitative differences in the volatiles produced with and
without enzymatic hydrolysis. However, the amount of typical aroma
components significantly increased in the hydrolysis sample, As
compared with the no-hydrolysis control, the first four aroma
components with the most increase were
6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecan-2-one, nonanal, dihydro-beta-ionol
and (E)-beta-ionone in the hydrolysis sample.
Megastigma-4,6(E),8(E)-triene was only found in the hydrolysis sample,
but the amount of trans-linalool oxide, cis-linalool oxide and
dihydro-3-oxo-ionol decreased. Organoleptic assessment supported that

TI Evaluation of salmon calcitonin (sCT) enteric-coated capsule for
enhanced absorption and GI tolerability in rats
SO DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRIAL PHARMACY
AB Background: Considering the chronic and repeated nature of salmon
calcitonin (sCT) therapy, the oral route is a preferred route of
administration. But, the oral bioavailability of sCT is very low due
to enzymatic degradation and poor permeation across intestinal
epithelial cells. It was the aim of this study to investigate the
pharmacodynamic (PD), pharmacokinetic (PK), and mucosal injury
characteristic of sCT oral delivery system. Method: In this study, PD
experiments were performed to find a suitable releasing region of sCT,
an effect absorption enhancer, and an optimal mass ratio of
sCT/enhancer. In addition, the PK experiments were designed to validate
the absorption enhancement of this oral delivery system.
Histopathological evaluations on the intestinal mucosa were carried
out to assess any potential toxicity of the absorption enhancer.
Results: Through the PD research, we determined that oral sCT
enteric-coated capsules containing sCT and citric acid (CA) with a
ratio of 1:20 may be an adaptable delivery. PK study further proved
that the oral absorption of sCT was enhanced from this delivery system.
Finally, no damage on intestinal mucosa was observed when rats received
the delivery system containing CA for up to 7 days. Conclusion: These
results suggested that enteric-coated capsules with a certain amount
of CA might give enhanced oral delivery of peptide drugs like sCT.</.

TI ZJM-289, a novel nitric oxide donor, alleviates the cerebral
ischaemic-reperfusion injury in rats
SO CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY
AB P>1. Current studies indicate that nitric oxide (NO) plays a dual role
as both a protective and pathogenic factor in focal cerebral ischaemia
depending on the level, location, source and environment. The present
study hypothesized that the NO donor ZJM-289 could inhibit cerebral
ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and investigated the mechanism of
the beneficial events.
2. Adult male rats were randomly divided into four groups: (i) sham
operated; (ii) I/R (ischaemia for 90 min and reperfusion for 24 h)
treated with vehicle; (iii) I/R treated with 0.1 mmol/kg body weight
ZJM-289; and (iv) I/R treated with 0.2 mmol/kg body weight ZJM-289.
We evaluated the changes in brain infarction, brain-water content,
neurological deficits and histopathology. Western blot analysis was
used to study the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the brain after
I/R. The levels of NO and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were
also determined.
3. ZJM-289 reduced infarct volume and brain-water content in ischemic
brains and promoted functional recovery. Western blotting showed
significant inhibition of nNOS in ZJM-289 treated rats compared with
untreated rats. However, eNOS expression in the ischemic brain was
enhanced in the ZJM-289 groups. The cGMP and NO levels increased in
the ZJM-289 groups after I/R. The study showed that ZJM-289 could
alleviate cerebral injury after I/R through inhibition of nNOS and
stimulation of the NO/soluble guanylate cyclase/cGMP pathway.
Therefore, a suitable NO donor might be an effective candidate for the
treatment of acute stroke by neuroprotection.

TI Novel thiophene derivatives as PTP1B inhibitors with selectivity and
cellular activity
SO BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB A series of novel thiophene derivatives was designed, synthesized and
their activities as competitive inhibitors of protein tyrosine
phosphatase (PTPs) 1B (PTP1B) inhibitors were evaluated. All the
compounds showed inhibitory potencies, and 10 of these exhibited
moderate inhibitory activities with IC50 values less than 10 mu M. The
activity of the most potent compound P28 (IC50 = 2.1 mu M) was 15 times
higher than that of the hit compound P01. Further, four representative
compounds (P19, P22, P28, and P31) demonstrated remarkably high
selectivities against other PTPs (e. g., PTP alpha, LAR, CD45, and
TCPTP); P19 exhibited greater than sixfold selectivity over highly
homologous TCPTP. More importantly, these compounds are permeable to
cell membranes. The treatment of CHO-K1 cells with P28 (10 mu M)
resulted in increased phosphorylation of AKT, which suggested
extensive cellular activity of this compound. The novel chemical
entities reported in this study could be used for overcoming the poor
selectivity and low cellular activity of PTP1B inhibitors and might
represent a starting point for development of therapeutic PTP
inhibitors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Metabonomic profiling of liver metabolites by gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry and its application to characterizing hyperlipidemia
SO BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB The measurement of metabolites in tissues is of great importance in
metabonomic research in the biomedical sciences, providing more
relevant information than is available from systemic biofluids. The
liver is the most important organ/tissue for most biochemical
reactions, and the metabolites in the liver are of great interest to
scientists. To develop an optimized extraction method and
comprehensive profiling technique for liver metabolites, organic
solvents of various compositions were designed using design of
experiments to extract metabolites from the liver, and the metabolites
were profiled by gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(GC/TOF-MS). The resolved peak areas were processed by principle
components analysis, partial least-squares projections to latent
structures, and discriminant analysis. The results suggest the highest
extraction efficiency was for methanol-water, which maximized the
majority of GC/TOF-MS responses. The optimal solvent was applied to
extract metabolites in liver of hyperlipidemia hamster and the control.
The GC/TOF-MS profiles of liver metabolites showed obvious differences
between hyperlipidemic hamsters and controls. A comparison of liver
and serum data from the same animals identified common biomarkers and
presented complementary information. Our results suggest that liver
metabonomics is a valuable technique and that the combined analysis
of systematic biofluids and local tissues is meaningful and
complementary, recovering more comprehensive metabonomic data than
either analysis alone. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Biotransformation of the antitumor intermediate 5-fluorouridine by
recombinant Escherichia coli with high pyrimidine nucleoside
phosporylase activity
SO BIOCATALYSIS AND BIOTRANSFORMATION
AB 5-Fluorouridine (5-FUrd) is a precursor of the widely used antitumor
drug doxifluridine. We have produced 5-FUrd by biotransformation by
cloning the gene encoding pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase
(PyNPase) from Enterobacter aero-genes CMCC (B) 45103 and expression
in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), resulting in recombinant E. coli BL21
(DE3)/ pET28a-PyNPase. After medium optimization, the PyNPase activity
in the fermentation broth was 1613 U mg<SU-1</SU, which was 54-fold
that of E. aerogenes. Under optimal conditions (cell concentration,
0.5 g L<SU-1</SU; uridine, 10 mM; 5-fluorouracil, 45 mM; temperature,
50 degrees C; pH, 7.8), more than 90% of uridine was converted to 5-FUrd,
suggesting that this is a valuable tool for application in the
preparation of antiviral and antitumor drugs.

TI SIMPLEX-STOCHASTIC RESONANCE ALGORITHM APPLIED TO DETECTION OF WEAK
CHROMATOGRAPHIC PEAKS
SO ANALYTICAL LETTERS
AB The simplex-stochastic resonance algorithm (SSRA) was applied to
amplification and detection of the weak High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) chromatographic signals of coumatetralyl in
plasma. In this algorithm, modified simplex algorithm was embedded to
greatly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of chromatographic signals.
The application of SSRA to detect HPLC/UV weak signals of coumatetralyl
showed an excellent quantitative relationship between different
concentrations and responses. The assay was linear over the
concentration range of 3-100 ng/mL, r = 0.9997, and RSD < 10%. The good
linearity and precision demonstrated that it is an effective algorithm
for detecting weak chromatographic peaks.

TI Pyrosequencing on Nicked dsDNA Generated by Nicking Endonucleases
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Although the pyrosequencing method is simple and fast, the step of ssDNA
preparation increases the cost, labor, and cross-contamination risk.
In this paper, we proposed a method enabling pyrosequencing directly
on dsDNA digested by nicking endonucleases (NEases). Recognition
sequence of NEases was introduced using artificially mismatched bases
in a PCR primer (in the case of genotyping) or a reverse-transcription
primer (in the case of gene expression analysis). PCR products were
treated to remove excess amounts of primers, nucleotides, and
pyrophosphate (PPi) prior to sequencing. After the nicking reaction,
pyrosequencing starts at the nicked 3' end, and extension reaction
occurs when the added dNTP is complementary to the non-nicked strand.
Although the activity of strand displacement by Klenow is limited,
similar to 10 bases are accurately sequenced; this length is long enough
for genotyping and SRPP-based differential gene expression analysis.
It was observed that the signals of two allele-specific bases in a
pyrogram from nicked dsDNA are highly quantitative, enabling
quantitative determination of allele-specific templates; thus, Down's
Syndrome diagnosis as well as differential gene expression analysis
was successfully executed. ne results indicate that pyrosequencing
using nicked dsDNA as templates is a simple, inexpensive, and reliable
way in either quantitative genotyping or gene expression analysis.

TI Two novel antimicrobial peptides from centipede venoms
SO TOXICON
AB Centipede venoms are complex mixtures of biochemically and
pharmacologically active components such as peptides and proteins.
Very few are known about their pharmacological actions. The present
work reports the structural and functional characterization of two
antimicrobial peptides (scolopin 1 and -2) identified from centipede
venoms of Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans by Sephadex gel filtration
and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC).
The amino acid sequences of scolopin 1 and -2 were
FLPKMSTKLRVPYRRGTKDYH and GILKKFMLHRGTKVYKMRTLSKRSH determined by
Edman degradation and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time
of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Both scolopin I and -2
showed strong antimicrobial activities against tested microorganisms
including Gram-positive/negative bacteria and fungi. They also showed
moderate hemolytic activity against both human and rabbit red cells.
This is the first report of antimicrobial peptides from centipedes.

TI Structural characterization of N-linked oligosaccharides of Defibrase
from Agikistrodon acutus by sequential exoglycosidase digestion and
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
SO TOXICON
AB Detailed structures of N-linked oligosaccharides of Defibrase, a
highly active thrombin like enzyme (TLE) purified from the venom of
Agkistrodon acutus, were successfully characterized using MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry in combination with sequential exoglycosidase
digestion. Monosaccharide composition analysis was performed by high
performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric
detection (HPAEC-PAD). Galactose(Gal), mannose(Man), fucose(Fuc),
N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and sialic acid (Neu5Ac) was detected
and the total carbohydrate content was about 19.4% (w/w). The N-linked
oligosaccharides were released by treatment with PNGase F, fluorescent
labeled with 2-aminobenzamide, and fractionated by high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). The main oligosaccharide fractions were
collected and further digested with an array of exoglycosidase
mixtures, and subsequent MALDI TOF MS analysis of the resulting
products yielded information about structural features of the
oligosaccharide. The combined data revealed the presence of five
distinct oligosaccharide structures in Defibrase, which are mainly
complex or hybrid type, with a small amount of oligomannosidic type.
The complex type oligosaccharides are mostly tri-or bi-antennary and
the hybrid oligosaccharides are all bi-antennary. Most
oligosaccharides are also found to be fucosylated. (C) 2009 Elsevier

TI Blood brain barrier permeability and therapeutic time window of
Ginkgolide B in ischemia-reperfusion injury
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB The goal of this study was to estimate the blood brain barrier (BBB)
permeability of Ginkgolide B in normal condition and models of ischemia
both in vivo and in vitro. A sensitive LC-MS/MS analytical method was
developed to determinate accurately the concentration of Ginkgolide
B in cell, plasma and brain tissue. The injured rat brain microvessel
endothelial cells (RBMECs) induced by Na2S2O4 served as a
hypoxia/reoxygenation model in vitro. Intracellular concentration of
Ginkgolide B increased in injured cells in a concentration-dependent
manner. As a model of in vivo-ischemia/reperfusion, we performed middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAC)in rats. Concentration of Ginkgolide
B in the brain tissues showed higher in cerebral ischemia-reperfused
animals than that in normal rats. To evaluate potential clinical effect
of Ginkgolide B, we determined therapeutic time window in MCAO rats.
Up to i.v. administration at 2 h after reperfusion of rats, Ginkgolide
B Could decrease infarction volume and brain edema, exerting
significant protective effect in cerebral ischemia injury. In
conclusion, Ginkgolide B could pass through BBB, especially after
ischemia-reperfusion injury of brain, and might be therapeutically
effective for ischemia/reperfusion injury of human brain. (C) 2009

TI General pharmacological properties, developmental toxicity, and
analgesic activity of gambogic acid, a novel natural anticancer agent
SO DRUG AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB In this article, the general pharmacological toxicity of gambogic acid
(GA), a new anticancer agent, on the dog cardiovascular and respiratory
system and the mouse central nervous system (CNS) were observed. The
developmental toxicity and analgesic activities of GA were also
investigated in rats and mice. Results showed that GA did not cause
any toxic symptoms on blood pressure (i.e., mean arterial pressure),
heart rate (HR), and respiratory frequency. However, a high dose of
GA showed slight side effects on the mouse CNS. Further, evidence of
maternal and developmental toxicity was observed in a dose-dependent
manner. The maternal body-weight gain, as well as the birth weights
and live birth index, were decreased significantly in the treatment
groups. The inhibitory effects of GA on fetal skeletal development were
also found. No obvious effects of GA on external alterations and
visceral alterations were shown. In the analgesic experiments, GA
showed significant analgesic activity in the acetic-acid-induced
writhing study in a dose-dependent manner. This mechanism might be
related to its anti-inflammation properties.

TI Quantitative design of seed load for solution cooling crystallization
based on kinetic analysis
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Seed load of crystallization has a direct effect on the product
qualities. To further reveal the effects of seed load on
crystallization kinetics and improve the product size distribution,
the aqueous solution of potassium nitrate (KNO3-H2O) is employed as
a model system and the relevant kinetic experiments are conducted in
a batch cooling crystallizer. The crystal nucleation and growth rate
parameters are firstly estimated with the concentration and
transmittance data using a mathematical model reported in our lab, and
then the backward calculations with the help of the model parameters
are successfully performed. It is found that the nucleation capacity
decreases and growth capacity increases with increasing seed load, and
the size distribution of crystal products tends to be more uniform.
However, with the increasing of seed load, the linear growth rate of
single crystal and the mean size of products both reduce accordingly.
Based on the calculational and experimental results, a quantitative
design scheme concerning seed load is proposed by further kinetic
analyses, and the corresponding verification experiments are carried
out. The results show that under the guidance of the proposed scheme,
the size distribution of crystal products is more concentrated and the
mean size of final particles can also escape from reducing obviously.

TI Modulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 release by berberine: In vivo
and in vitro studies
SO BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 is a potent glucose-dependent
insulinotropic gut hormone released from intestinal L cells. Our
previous studies showed that berberine increased GLP-1 secretion in
streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The aim of this study was to
investigate whether berberine affected GLP-1 release in normal rats
and in NCI-H716 cells. Proglucagon and prohormone convertase 3 genes
regulating GLP-1 biosynthesis were analyzed by RT-PCR. Effects of
pharmacological inhibitors on berberine-mediated GLP-1 release were
studied. In vivo,5-week treatment of berberine enhanced GLP-1
secretion induced by glucose load and promoted proglucagon mRNA
expression as well as L cell proliferation in intestine. In vitro,
berberine concentration-dependently stimulated GLP-1 release in
NCI-H716 cells. Berberine also promoted both prohormone convertase 3
and proglucagon mRNA expression. Chelerythrine (inhibitor of PKC)
concentration-dependently suppressed berberine-mediated GLP-1
secretion. Compound C (inhibitor of AMPK) also inhibited
berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion. But only low concentrations of H89
(inhibitor of PKA) showed inhibitory effects on berberine-mediated
GLP-1 release. The present results demonstrated that berberine showed
its modulation on GLP-1 via promoting GLP-1 secretion and GLP-1
biosynthesis. Some signal pathways including PKC-dependent pathway
were involved in this process. Elucidation of mechanisms controlling
berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion may facilitate the understanding
of berberine's antidiabetic effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

TI Microbial conversion of ruscogenin by Gliocladium deliquescens
NRRL1086: glycosylation at C-1
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The glycosylation of ruscogenin (1) by Gliocladium deliquescens NRRL
1086 was observed and gave a regioselectively glycosylated product
identified as ruscogenin 1-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2) by infrared,
mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Time-course
studies indicated that it appeared to be favorable to accumulate 2 when
ruscogenin was added to the 24-h-old stage II culture, and the yield
of 2 was about 20.1% during 120 similar to 168 h. It was noted that
additional carbohydrates could significantly increase glycoside
formation and the yield of 2 even reached as high as 68% compared with
the control 20.1%. The primary investigation about the characteristics
of the enzyme resulted that the reaction was blocked by
beta-glycosidase inhibitor imidazole, however, was enhanced
remarkably by glycosyltransferase inhibitor sodium dodecyl sulfate.
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of producing steroidal
saponin by microbial transformation, and G. deliquescens NRRL1086
would be a practical and highly efficient tool in producing natural
ruscogenin monoside.

TI Coupled stochastic resonance to improve chromatography determinations
SO ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Traditional bistable stochastic resonance has been demonstrated as an
effective tool to detect the weak signal in a strong noise background.
To achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio for the output signal, a
coupled stochastic resonance was developed by nonlinearly coupling two
double-well potential systems. The response characteristics of coupled
stochastic resonance subjected to analytical signals have been
investigated and compared with those of bistable stochastic resonance.
The improvement of chromatographic determination with the proposed
coupled stochastic resonance was validated by both simulated signals
and chromatographic signals. The weak signals from both simulated data
and plasma samples with different concentrations were all amplified
significantly and the quantitative relationship between different
concentrations and responses was kept well. It is reasonable to believe
that coupled stochastic resonance could play an important role in
applications where quantitative determination of low-concentration
samples is crucial.

TI Berberine Inhibits HIV Protease Inhibitor-Induced Inflammatory
Response by Modulating ER Stress Signaling Pathways in Murine
Macrophages
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: HIV protease inhibitor (PI)-induced inflammatory response
plays an important role in HIV PI-associated dyslipidemia and
cardiovascular complications. This study examined the effect of
berberine, a traditional herb medicine, on HIV PI-induced inflammatory
response and further investigated the underlying cellular/molecular
mechanisms in macrophages.
Methodology and Principal Findings: Cultured mouse J774A.1 macrophages
and primary mouse macrophages were used in this study. The expression
of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were detected by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA.
Activations of ER stress and ERK signaling pathways were determined
by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescent staining was used to
determine the intracellular localization of RNA binding protein HuR.
RNA-pull down assay was used to determine the association of HuR with
endogenous TNF-alpha and IL-6. Berberine significantly inhibited HIV
PI-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression by modulating ER stress
signaling pathways and subsequent ERK activation, in turn preventing
the accumulation of the RNA binding protein HuR in cytosol and
inhibiting the binding of HuR to the 3'-UTRs of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in
macrophages.
Conclusions and Significance: Inhibition of ER stress represents a key
mechanism by which berberine prevents HIV PI-induced inflammatory
response. Our findings provide a new insight into the molecular
mechanisms of berberine and show the potential application of berberine
as a complimentary therapeutic agent for HIV infection.

TI CPU228, a derivative of dofetilide, relieves cardiac dysfunction by
normalizing FKBP12.6, NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C epsilon in
the myocardium
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Objectives The aim of this study was to determine if CPU228, a
derivative of dofetilide, is more effective than dofetilide in
attenuating isoproterenol-induced heart failure by recovering
downregulated FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6), and suppressing
oxidative stress, upregulated NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C
epsilon (PKC epsilon) hyperphosphorylation in the myocardium.
Methods Heart failure was induced by isoproterenol (1 mg/kg s.c. for
5 days) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Intervention with either CPU228
or dofetilide (2 mg/kg on Days 3-5) was then conducted in vivo and in
vitro.
Key findings Isoproterenol produced compromised left ventricular
systolic pressure, left ventricular pressure rise (dp/dt(max)) and
fall (dp/dt(min)), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure,
associated with oxidative stress, abnormal FKBP12.6, NADPH oxidase
p67phox and PKC epsilon in the rnyocardium. CPU228 was more effective
in attenuating these changes than dofetilide in vivo. Dofetilide
produced a prolonged QTc to replace a shortened one. In primary neonatal
cardiomyocytes, cultured with isoproterenol and treated with either
CPU228 or dofetilide at 10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/l, isoproterenol
produced a hyperadrenergic state characterized by downregulated
FKBP12.6, upregulated NADPH oxidase p67phox and PKC epsilon in vitro.
CPU228 was more effective than dofetilide in recovering these changes
in a dose-dependent manner without a prolonged QTc.
Conclusions CPU228 was more effective than dofetilide in attenuating
heart failure by normalizing isoproterenol-induced changes, including
downregulation of FKBP12.6, upregulation of NADPH oxidase and PKC
epsilon hyperphosphorylation in vivo and in vitro.

high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for
simultaneous determination of verticine, verticinone and isoverticine
in rat plasma
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB A method based on the on-line turbulent-flow chromatography and fast
high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (TFC-LC/MS)
was developed for sensitive and high throughput pharmacokinetic Study
of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). In this method, an on-line
extraction column (Waters Oasis HLB) and a fast HPLC Column with sub-2
mu m particle size (Agilent Zorbax StableBond-C-18, 4.6 mm x 50 mm,
1.8 mu m) in a column-switching set-up were utilized. HLB is a
reversed-phase extraction column with hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced
copolymer (2.1 mm x 20mm, 25 mu m particle size), which will exhibit
some turbulent-flow properties at a high-flow rate. The method combines
the speed and robustness of turbulent-flow extraction and the
sensitivity and separation efficiency of fast HPLC-MS to analyze
multiple and trace constituents of TCMs in plasma matrix. This method
was successfully applied for pharmacokinetic Study of verticine,
verticinone and isoverticine, the chemical markers of Fritillaria
thunbergii, after oral administration of total steroidal alkaloids
extract of F. thunbergii to rats. Each plasma sample was analyzed within
7 min. The method demonstrated good linearity (R > 0.999) ranged from
0.505 to 96.0 ng/mL with satisfactory accuracy and precision, and the
lower limit of quantifications of verticine, verticinone and
isoverticine were estimated to be 0.120. 0.595 and 0.505 ng/mL,
respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method is fast,
sensitive, and feasible for pharmacokinetic Study of TCMs. (C) 2009

TI DNA cleavage promoted by trigonal-bipyramidal zinc(II) and copper(II)
complexes formed by asymmetric tripodal tetradendate
2-[bis(2-aminoethyl)amino]ethanol
SO INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Asymmetric trigonal-bipyramidal Zn(II) complex 1 formed by
2-[bis(2-aminoethyl) amino]ethanol (L) was found to be able to promote
the cleavage of supercoiled plasmid DNA pBR322 to the nicked and linear
DNA via a hydrolytic manner but only in neutral Tris-HCl buffer, no
cleavage was observed in HEPES or NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer. However, the
copper complex 2 of L, possessing the similar coordination geometry,
can only promote DNA cleavage via an oxidative mechanism in the presence
of ascorbic acid. ESI-MS study implies that complex 1 exist mainly as
[Zn(L)](2+)/[Zn(L-H)](+) in neutral Tris-HCl buffer. Moreover, there
is no discriminable species for complex 1 in HEPES or NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4
buffer. A phosphate activation mechanism via phosphate coordinating
to Zn(II) center of [Zn(L)](2+)/[Zn(L-H)](+) to form the stable
trigonal-bipyramidal structure is proposed for the hydrolytic cleavage
promote by complex 1. For complex 2, the abundance of [Cu(L)Cl](+) is
higher than that of [Cu(L)](2+)/[Cu(L-H)](+) in Tris-HCl buffer. The
lower phosphate binding/activating ability of Cu(II) in complex 2 may
be the origin for its incapability to promote the hydrolytic DNA
cleavage. However, the readily accessible redox potential of Cu(II)
makes complex 2 promote the oxidative DNA cleavage. Although the DNA
cleavage promoted by complex 1 has no specificity,
trigonal-bipyramidal Zn(II) complexes formed by asymmetric tripodal
polyamine with ethoxyl pendent should be a novel potential model for
practical artificial nuclease. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights

TI Study on enantiomeric separation of basic drugs by NACE in
methanol-based medium using erythromycin lactobionate as a chiral
selector
SO ELECTROPHORESIS
AB A wide variety of chiral selectors have been employed in CZE, and among
them macrocyclic antibiotics including glycopeptides, ansamycins,
aminoglycosides and polypeptides exhibited prominent enantioselective
properties toward abundant racemic compounds. Compared with CZE, the
use of macrocyclic antibiotic! as chiral selectors in NACE has not been
reported previously. In this study, an approach to the
enantioseparation of basic drugs by means of NACE with erythromycin
lactobionate (EL) belonging to the group of macrolide antibiotics has
been investigated. Especially different from the above four classes
of antibiotics, there are no reports concerned with the use of
macrolides which belong to macrocyclic antibiotics as chiral selectors
in CE. In this work EL is first used as a chiral selector in NACE for
the enantiomeric separations of two racemic basic drugs that possess
high separability consisting of propranolol and duloxetine.
Furthermore, EL possesses advantages such as high solubility and low
viscosity in the solvent and very weak UV absorption. The chiral
separations were achieved using Tris-boric acid as the BGE and methanol
as the organic medium. In the course of this work we observed that both
migration time and enantioseparation were influenced by several
parameters such as the pH and composition of the BGE, EL concentration,
capillary temperature and applied voltage. Consequently, these
parameters were systematically optimized in order to obtain the optimum
enantioseparations.

TI Central administration of kisspeptin-10 inhibits natriuresis and
diuresis induced by blood volume expansion in anesthetized male rats
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To investigate the possible role of hypothalamic kisspeptin in
the regulation of body fluid metabolism and maintenance of internal
homeostasis.
Methods: Natriuresis and diuresis were induced by blood volume
expansion (VE) in anesthetized male rats and kisspeptin-10 was
intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered. Radioimmunoassay (RIA)
was used to measure the plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) and atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations during the VE. The mediation
of the renal sympathetic nerve was also investigated in rats with
bilateral renal sympathetic denervation.
Results: The increased urine flow and sodium excretion induced by VE
were significantly inhibited by icv injection of 5 nmol kisspeptin-10
(P < 0.05), which peaked 20 min after the decrease in VE. The mean
arterial blood pressure and heart rate did not change during the
experiment. Plasma AVP concentrations were significantly increased 20
min after icv injection of 5 nmol kisspeptin-10 during VE (P < 0.05),
while pretreatment with 5 nmol kisspeptin-10 did not significantly
change plasma ANP concentrations. Furthermore, pretreatment with 5
nmol kisspeptin-10 could significantly inhibit VE-induced natriuresis
and diuresis in renal sympathetic denervated rats (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Central administration of kisspeptin-10 inhibited
VE-induced natriuresis and diuresis. This effect was likely mediated
by increasing AVP release independent of plasma ANP concentration and
renal sympathetic nerve activity.

TI CPU86017, a berberine derivative, attenuates cardiac failure through
normalizing calcium leakage and downregulated phospholamban and
exerting antioxidant activity
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To investigate whether CPU86017, a berberine derivative,
attenuates heart failure by blocking calcium influx and exerting its
antioxidant activity.
Methods: Myocardial infarction was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats
for 17 d followed by isoproterenol (ISO) (5 mg/kg, sc) treatment for
5 d to reduce cardiac function. The rats were divided into 5 groups:
sham operation, myocardial infarction (MI), MI plus ISO, and co-treated
(in mg/kg, po) with either propranolol (PRO, 10) or CPU86017 (80).
Hemodynamic measurements were conducted, and measurements of the redox
system, calcium handling proteins and endothelin (ET) system in vivo
were done. Furthermore, calcium flux studies and PLB
immunocytochemistry were conducted in vitro.
Results: Compared to sham operation, HF was evident following MI and
further worsened by ISO treatment. This occurred in parallel with
downregulated mRNA and protein production of SERCA2a, PLB, and
FKBP12.6, and was associated with upregulation of preproET-1,
endothelin converting enzyme, and PKA mRNA production in the myocardium
in vivo. Calcium leakage was induced by ISO treatment of isolated
beating myocytes in vitro. These changes were attenuated by treatment
with either PRO or CPU86017. PLB fluorescence in myocytes was
downregulated by ISO treatment, and was relieved significantly by
treatment with antioxidant aminoguanidine, ascorbic acid or CPU86017
in vitro.
Conclusion: HF, calcium leakage, downregulated PLB, FKBP12.6, SERCA2a
production, and upregulated PKA were caused by ISO treatment, and were
abolished by CPU86017 treatment. The beneficial effects of CPU86017
are attributable to its antioxidant and calcium influx blocking
effects.

TI Immunomodulatory activity of andrographolide on macrophage activation
and specific antibody response
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To investigate the immunomodulatory effects of andrographolide
on both innate and adaptive immune responses.
Methods: Andrographolide (10 mu g/mL in vitro or 1 mg/kg in vivo) was
used to modulate LPS-induced classical activated (M1) or IL-4-induced
alternative activated (M2) macrophages in vitro and humor immune
response to HBsAg in vivo. Cytokine gene expression profile (M1 vs M2)
was measured by real-time PCR, IL-12/IL-10 level was detected by ELISA,
and surface antigen expression was evaluated by flow cytometry, whereas
phosphorylation level of ERK 1/2 and AKT was determined by Western blot.
The level of anti-HBs antibodies in HBsAg immunized mice was detected
by ELISA, and the number of HBsAg specific IL-4-producing splenocyte
was enumerated by ELISPOT.
Results: Andrographolide treatment in vitro attenuated either LPS or
IL-4 induced macrophage activation, inhibited both M1 and M2 cytokines
expression and decreased IL-12/IL-10 ratio (the ratio of M1/M2
polarization). Andrographolide down-regulated the expression of
mannose receptor (CD206) in IL-4 induced macrophages and major
histocompability complex/costimulatory molecules (MHC I, CD40, CD80,
CD86) in LPS-induced macrophages. Correspondingly, anti-HBs antibody
production and the number of IL-4-producing splenocytes were reduced
by in vivo administration of andrographolide. Reduced phosphorylation
levels of ERK1/2 and AKT were observed in macrophages treated with
andrographolide.
Conclusion: Andrographolide can modulate the innate and adaptive
immune responses by regulating macrophage phenotypic polarization and
Ag-specific antibody production. MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways may
participate in the mechanisms of andrographolide regulating macrophage
activation and polarization.

TI The Level of Connective Tissue Growth Factor in Sera of Patients with
Hepatitis B Virus Strongly Correlates with Stage of Hepatic Fibrosis
SO VIRAL IMMUNOLOGY
AB Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) plays a crucial role in the
formation and development of hepatic fibrosis. The aim of this study
was to establish a method for CTGF determination in order to investigate
the level of CTGF in the sera of patients with hepatitis B virus, and
to assess the correlation between CTGF concentration and stage of
hepatic fibrosis. A CTGF C-terminal region gene was obtained by RT-PCR
of human mesangial kidney cells and inserted into pET-32a((+)) vector.
Recombinant protein was obtained by expression and purification of the
fused protein. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were prepared to
establish a sandwich ELISA method. CTGF levels in 18 healthy serum
samples and 83 serum samples from patients with hepatitis B virus were
assessed. A simple, sensitive, and noninvasive method of determining
CTGF levels was successfully established. CTGF levels in the sera of
patients with hepatitis B were significantly increased compared
controls (p<0.001). There was a strong correlation between CTGF
concentration and fibrotic stage (r - 0.8906, p<0.005). No significant
association was found between CTGF level and the grade of hepatic
inflammation (p>0.05). The area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves of CTGF was 0.681 for identification of
significant fibrosis, and 0.759 for the diagnosis of middle-and
late-stage fibrosis. Accuracy of CTGF assessment was independent of
age, renal function, liver function, platelet count, or other
biochemical markers of liver fibrosis (all p>0.05). No significant
correlation was found between CTGF and several humoral factors
associated with liver fibrosis (all p>0.05). The levels of CTGF in the
sera of patients with hepatitis B were strongly associated with the
stages of hepatic fibrosis, and CTGF may become a useful diagnostic
aid in assessing hepatic fibrosis.

TI Herb-Drug Interactions: In Vivo and In Vitro Effect of Shenmai
Injection, a Herbal Preparation, on the Metabolic Activities of Hepatic
Cytochrome P450 3A1/2, 2C6, 1A2, and 2E1 in Rats
SO PLANTA MEDICA
AB Shenmai injection (SMI), a mixture of Radix Ginseng and Radix
Ophiopogonis, is one of the most popular herbal medicinal products and
is widely used for the treatment of coronary atherosclerotic
cardiopathy and viral myocarditis. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the effect of SMI, in vivo and in vitro, on the metabolic
activities of hepatic cytochrome CYP450 3A1/2, 2C6, 2E1, and 1A2 in
rats. After a single or multiple pretreatment with SMI, the rats were
administrated intravenously a cocktail containing midazolam (1 mg/kg),
diclofenac (0.5 mg/kg), theophylline (1 mg/kg), and chlorzoxazone (0.5
mg/kg) as probe substrates of rat CYP450 3A1/2, 2C6, 1A2, and 2E1,
respectively. Single and multiple SMI pretreatment to rats resulted
in a rise of 33.8% (p < 0.01) and 25.6% (p < 0.01) in AUC for midazolam,
and an increase in AUC for diclofenac by 14.7% (p < 0.05) and 31.2%
(p < 0.01), respectively. However, the pharmacokinetics of
chlorzoxazone and theophylline in rats was not altered markedly. In
rat liver microsomes, linear mixed-type inhibition of SMI against the
enzyme activities of CYP3A1/2, CYP2C6, and CYP1A2 was shown with IC50
values of 3.3%, 2.0%, and 3.1% and K-i values of 3.8%, 1.5%. and 1.9%,
respectively. These in vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that SMI
had the potential to inhibit the activities of hepatic CYP3A1/2 and
CYP2C6, but might not significantly affect CYP1A2 and CYP2E1-mediated
metabolism in rats.

SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
AB A simple, rapid, sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the
quantification of azithromycin in rabbit conjunctiva tissues using
roxithromycin as internal standard. Following a deproteinization
procedure, the samples were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 0.3
mL/min utilizing a mobile phase containing of 10 mM ammonium acetate
(adjusted pH to 5.2 with 0.1% acetic acid)-methanol (18:82, v/v) and
a SHISEIDO CAPCELL PAK C-18 (3.0 mm x 75 mm, 3 mu m). Azithromycin and
its internal standard were measured by a triple-quadrupole mass
spectrometer in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode with
precursor-to-product qualifier transition m/z 375 [M+2H](2+) -> 591
and m/z 837 [M+H](+) -> 679 respectively. The method demonstrated that
good linearity ranged from 10 to 2000 ng/mL with r = 0.9998. The lower
limit of quantification for azithromycin in conjunctiva tissues was
10 ng/mL with good accuracy and precision. The intra- and inter-day
precision (RSD) values were below 15% and accuracy (%) ranged from 90%
to 110% at all QC levels. The method was applicable to ocular

TI Effects of Hydroxypropylation on the Functional Properties of Psyllium
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB The hydroxypropylated psyllium derivatives were successfully prepared
with propylene oxide under the alkaline condition for the first time.
Four hydroxypropylated psyllium derivatives, denoted as HP1, HP2, HP3,
and HP4, were characterized for their hydroxypropyl content, molar
substitution, and IR spectra. The hydroxypropyl derivatives were also
evaluated for their surface structure, gelling properties, water
uptake capacities, swelling volumes, and in vitro bile acid-binding
abilities. The results showed that hydroxypropylation significantly
reduced the gelling properties of psyllium. Psyllium derivatives with
a relatively low hydroxypropyl substitution degree had greater in vitro
binding capacities against cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids and
higher swelling ability. The results from this study suggested that
hydroxypropylation may be a possible approach for obtaining novel
psyllium derivatives with improved physicochemical, functional, and

TI Purification, Characterization and Immuno-Modulating Properties of
Polysaccharides Isolated from Flammulina velutipes Mycelium
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE MEDICINE
AB To investigate the immuno-modulating activity of Flammulina velutipes
mycelium, three different Flammulina velutipes polysaccharides (FVPs)
were isolated by fractionation using gel filtration and were identified
as the immunomodulators of murine peritoneal macrophages. Based on the
results of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), NMR spectroscopy,
methylation analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrogram (GC-MS),
FVP2C was identified as glucose, galactose, mannose and fucose in molar
ratio of 100: 14: 7: 4. FVP2C, molecular weight of 27.3 x 10(3) Da,
was characterized as alpha-D-(1 -> 4)-glucan which was highly branched
with alpha-D-(1 -> 6)-glucosyl residues, a single galactose or small
amounts of mannoses and fucose at the C-6 position every twelve
residues, on average, along the main chain. In the present study, it
was found that three FVPs induced a significant increase in cellular
nitric oxide formation, interleukin-1 production and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha secretion in macrophages in vitro. The immuno-modulating
activity of FVP2A, FVP2B and FVP2C was dose-dependent.

TI Structure and function relationships of three novel hGHRH-GGC analogs
SO REGULATORY PEPTIDES
AB Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) is one of the hypothalamus
hormones. For its potential applications in agriculture and medicine,
GHRH analog with higher activity and longer half-life has been looked
for. By using the fusion expression with unique acid labile linker
Asp-Pro and biochemical purification, the three novel GHRH peptides,
Pro-Pro-hGHRH(1-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys, Pro-hGHRH(1-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys, and
(1)Pro-GHRH(2-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys, were obtained. The peptide molecular
weight with 5,455, 5,373 or 5,210 Da measured by EIS-MS is coincident
with the actual values. The peptides at 0.1-10 mu g/ml increased rat
pituitary GH releases in a dose-dependent manner and at 5 mu g/ml
increased human pituitary GH releases. The activity comparisons showed
that at 10 mu g/ml there were significant between
(1)Pro-hGHRH(2-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys and Pro-Pro-hGHRH(1-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys
or Pro-hGHRH(1-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys, (1)Pro-hGHRH(2-44) (P<0.05). The
(1)Pro-hGHRH(2-44)-Gly-Gly-Cys showed the highest GH release from rat
pituitary. The activity results showed that the N-terminal Pro
modulations and the C-terminal Gly-Gly-Cys extension regulate GH
release from pituitary. The results showed that the three peptides had
good GH release, function-selectivity and species specificity.

TI Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Capsaicin Derivatives as
Analgesia Drugs
SO LETTERS IN DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY
AB TRPV1 is an important analgesia target. Capsaicin, the prototypical
TRPV1 agonist, has a clear therapeutic potential. But the highly
pungency limited its use. In this letter, for lowering its pungency,
a series of capsaicin derivatives were designed and synthesized,
including 10 compounds which were the direct combination of capsaicin
and dihydro capsaicin with various NSAIDs. Preliminary biological
tests suggested that some compounds had both anti-inflammatory
activity and analgesic activity and their pungency was lower. Based
on these results, some of these molecules can be considered as lead
candidates for the further development of analgesic drugs.

TI LYG-202, a Newly Synthesized Flavonoid, Exhibits Potent
Anti-angiogenic Activity In Vitro and In Vivo
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB LYG-202 (C25H30N2O5) is a newly synthesized flavonoid that has been
confirmed to possess an antitumor effect, but the mechanism is unclear.
Our present study was performed to identify the anti-angiogenic
activity of this novel compound in vitro and in vivo. LYG-202 inhibited
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) Stimulated migration and
tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and arrested
microvessel outgrowth from rat aortic rings in vitro. Meanwhile,
LYG-202 suppressed the neovascularization of Chicken Chorioallantoic
Membrane in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that LYG-202 suppressed
the VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 (VEGFR-2) as
well as its downstream protein kinases activation, by decreasing
phosphorylated forms of serine/threonine kinase Akt, extracellular
signal-regulated kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.
LYG-202 exerts anti-angiogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo, and
these results suggest that it deserves further investigation as a
promising anti-tumor angiogenesis compound.

TI Two tachykinin-like peptides from skin secretions of Danio rerio
SO JOURNAL OF PEPTIDE SCIENCE
AB Tachykinin perform multiple physiological functions such as smoothing
muscle contraction, vasodilation, inflammation, the processing of
nerve signal, neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. Two novel
tachykinin-like peptides named tachykinin-DR1 and -DR2 were identified
from skin secretions of Danio rerio in current work. Their amino acid
sequences were determined as SKSQHFHGLM-NH2 and NKGEIFVGLM-NH2,
respectively. They share a conserved FXGLM-NH2 C-terminal consensus
motif. By cDNA cloning, the precursor encoding both tachykinin-DR1 and
-DR2 was screened from the skin cDNA library of D. rerio. Tachykinin-DR1
and -DR2 share the same precursor, which is composed of 108 amino acid
(aa) residues. Regarding the biological activity, tachykinin-DRs could
induce the contraction of isolated strips of guinea pig ileum just like
other tackykinins. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of
tachykinin from fish skin. Copyright (C) 2009 European Peptide Society

TI Simultaneous determination of twelve bioactive constituents in Buyang
Huanwu decoction by HPLC-DAD-ELSD and HPLC-TOF/MS
SO BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY
AB Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHYD) is a classical traditional Chinese
medicinal prescription that has been widely used for treating
cerebrovascular illnesses for hundreds of years. In this study, a
comprehensive analytical method has been developed for quantitative
analysis of the major constituents in BYHWD. This method was based on
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array and
evaporative light scattering detectors (HPLC-DAD-ELSD) on a common
reverse-phase C-18 column. HPLC coupled with on-line time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (HPLC-TOF/MS) was additionally adopted to provide
further validation for the constituents. It was found that 0.3% aqueous
formic acid and acetonitrile was the optimum mobile phase for gradient
elution. This method, which showed excellent precision and accuracy,
was successfully applied to quantify the bioactive constituents in six
BYHWD products. The validated HPLC-DAD-ELSD method, together with the
HPLC-TOF/MS analysis, provided a new basis for assessing the quality
of traditional Chinese medicinal prescription consisting of many
bioactive components. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Inhibitory Effects of Baicalein on the Influenza Virus in Vivo Is
Determined by Baicalin in the Serum
SO BIOLOGICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB Baicalein, an extract from Scutellaria baicalensis, was evaluated for
its ability to inhibit the influenza virus in vivo. Oral administration
of baicalein to BALB/c mice infected with the influenza
A/FM1/1/47(H1N1) virus showed significant effects in preventing death,
increasing the mean time to death, inhibiting lung consolidation, and
reducing the lung virus titer in a dose-dependent manner. These effects
are believed to be due to baicalin, the metabolite of baicalein in the
serum. At a concentration of baicalin 2 mu g/ml in overlay medium, it
showed significant inhibition in the plaque assay, and the mean IC50
value of baicalin was calculated as 1.2 mu g/ml in the cytopathic effect
assay. Our results showed that baicalein warrants further research as
a potential antiinfluenza viral agent.

AB A novel and Rapid Resolution Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography-Diode Array Detector method has been developed and
validated for the simultaneous determination of sildenafil,
vardenafil, and tadalafil in pharmaceutical preparations and
counterfeit drugs. An Agilent Zorbax SB C8 column (50 x 4.6 mm i.d.,
1.8 mu m particle size) was used. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture
of 0.030 M of ammonium formate (adjusted to pH 3.0 with formic acid)
and acetonitrile in the ratio 70:30. Ultraviolet (UV) detection was
performed at 230 nm. Total run time was 7 min; these three drugs were
eluted at the retention times of 1.654, 2.032, and 5.067 min for
vardenafil, sildenafil, and tadalafil, respectively. The method was
validated for accuracy, precision, linearity, specificity, and
sensitivity. From the validation study, it was found that the method
is specific, rapid, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Calibration
curves were linear over the concentration ranges of 0.2-200 mu g ml(-1)
for sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil. The limits of detection
(LOD) values were 1.0, 1.1, and 1.0 ng and the limit of quantification
(LOQ) values were 2.0, 2.1, and 2.0 ng for sildenafil, vardenafil, and
tadalafil, respectively. The method is rapid both for routine
quantitative analysis of sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil in
pharmaceutical preparations and screening their suspected counterfeit
drugs.

TI Antifibrotic effects of ZK(14), a novel nitric oxide-donating
biphenyldicarboxylate derivative, on rat HSC-T6 cells and CCl4-induced
hepatic fibrosis
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Aim: To study the pharmacologic effect of ZK(14), a novel nitric
oxide-donating biphenyldicarboxylate (DDB) derivative, on HSC-T6
cells and on CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis.
Methods: Inhibition of HSC-T6 cell growth by ZK(14) was evaluated by
MTT assay. The effect of ZK(14) on the percentage of HSC-T6 cells
undergoing apoptosis was measured using Annexin-V/PI double-staining
and TUNEL assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and caspase
activities were tested. Hepatic fibrosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley
rats by intraperitoneal injection with 14% CCl4. Rats with hepatic
fibrosis were randomly divided into four groups: model control, ZK(14)
(20 mg/kg), ZK(14) (10 mg/kg) and DDB (5 mg/kg). Levels of aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hyaluronic
acid (HA), type III collagen (PCIII), and nitric oxide (NO) were
assessed, and liver samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The
NO level in cells treated with ZK(14) in vitro was also measured.
Results: The effect of ZK(14) on HSC-T6 cell apoptosis was
concentration-and time-dependent, with up to 50% of cells becoming
apoptotic when exposed to 100 mu mol/L ZK(14) for 18 h. ZK(14) treatment
resulted in mitochondrial membrane depolarization and activation of
caspases 3 and 9. At a dose of 20 mg/kg, ZK(14) significantly decreased
serum transaminase (AST, ALT) activities and fibrotic index (HA, PCIII)
levels and significantly inhibited fibrogenesis.
Conclusion: These data indicate that ZK(14), a novel NO-donating DDB
derivative, promotes HSC-T6 apoptosis in vitro through a signaling
mechanism involving mitochondria and caspase activation and it
inhibits CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in vivo. The results suggest
that ZK(14) has potential therapeutic value in the treatment of hepatic
fibrosis.

TI Increased Oral AUC of Baicalin in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats
due to the Increased Activity of Intestinal beta-Glucuronidase
SO PLANTA MEDICA
AB The purpose of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of
baicalin, a major bioactive component of Scutellariae radix, in
diabetic conditions. The 4-week diabetic rats were induced by
intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin. Plasma
concentrations of baicalin were measured following oral (200 mg/kg)
or intravenous (12 mg/kg) administration. Everted intestinal
transport, intestinal mucosal metabolism of baicalin and intestinal
beta-glucuronidase activity were also investigated. It was found that
the diabetic condition significantly increased the exposure of
baicalin following oral doses (AUC 100.77 +/- 4.16 mu g . h/mL in
diabetic rats vs. 48.48 +/- 7.94 mu g . h/mL in normal rats). In
contrast, the diabetic condition significantly decreased the exposure
of baicalin following intravenous doses (AUC 11.20 +/- 2.28 mu g . h/mL
in diabetic rats vs. 18.02 +/- 3.45 mu g . h/mL in normal rats). We
also found lower apparent permeability coefficients of baicalin in the
ileum of diabetic rats (8.43 x 10(-6) +/- 2.40 x 10(-6) cm/s in diabetic
rats vs. 5.21 x 10(-5) +/- 1.55 x 10(-5) cm/s in normal rats). Further
studies showed that the diabetic condition enhanced the hydrolysis of
baicalin to baicalein in intestinal mucosal, accompanied by an increase
of beta-glucuronidase activity. All these results suggested that the
higher oral exposure of baicalin in diabetic rats did not result from
the decreased hepatic metabolism or increased intestinal absorption
of baicalin. The enhancement of intestinal beta-glucuronidase activity
may partly account for the higher exposure of baicalin in diabetic rats
after oral administration.

TI Enhanced distribution and extended elimination of glycyrrhetinic acid
in mice liver by mPEG-PLA modified (mPEGylated) liposome
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS
AB A rapid and simple method of high-performance liquid chromatography
with UV detector for the quantification of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA)
in mice plasma and tissues has been developed and validated. With the
established assay method, the pharmacokinetic profiles and tissue
distribution of GA in different formulations are compared in mice after
intravenous administration of the drug(25 mg/kg). The results showed
that mPEG-PLA modified (mPEGylated) GA liposome (PL-GA) significantly
prolonged the mean residence time (MRT) of GA in mice plasma and liver
(MRT: 0.43 +/- 0.13 and 1.72 +/- 0.11 h, respectively) than the normal
GA liposome (L-GA) (MRT: 0.23 +/- 0.01 and 1.07 +/- 0.31 h,
respectively) and GA sodium injection (S-GA) (MRT: 0.13 +/- 0.01 and
0.95 +/- 0.08 h, respectively). Moreover, PL-GA specifically increased
GA uptake in liver (AUC(0-infinity,) (liver) value of 1.6-fold and
1.3-fold higher than that for S-GA and L-GA, respectively) and reduced
its distribution into other tissues after dosing. Due to these
pharmacokinetic properties, it may be promising to develop PL-GA
further as a new pharmaceutical preparation for GA on the treatment
of various chronic hepatic diseases. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

TI Interaction of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin with
lipopolysaccharide in vitro and in an experimental mouse model of
septic shock caused by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate of
Escherichia coli
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS
AB s-thanatin, an analogue of thanatin, was synthesised by substituting
the fifteenth amino acid threonine with serine and showed broad
antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria. To evaluate its antimicrobial activity against a
multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical isolate as well as its
anti-endotoxin activity, its lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding and
-neutralising activity in vitro and its therapeutic efficacy in an
experimental model of septic shock caused by a MDR clinical isolate
of Escherichia coli were studied. The ability of s-thanatin to bind
or neutralise LPS from E. coli O111:B4 was determined using a
quantitative assay kit. Male ICR mice were given an intraperitoneal
(i.p.) administration of 2 x 1010 colony-forming units of E. coli
E79466. Following bacterial challenge, all animals were randomised to
receive i.p. administration of saline, 40 mg/kg ceftazidime (CAZ), or
40 mg/kg CAZ + s-thanatin (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg). The results showed that
s-thanatin not only completely bound to the LPS (median effective
concentration of 17.5 mu g/mL) but also improved the survival and
reduced the number of inoculated bacteria in a mouse model of septic
shock. s-thanatin may be an attractive candidate to develop as an
anti-MDR bacterial agent. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. and the International

TI Analysis of heartbeat asymmetry based on multi-scale time
irreversibility test
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We investigate the asymmetry of heart rate control system and suggest
a simple index to quantify this asymmetry by performing
high-dimensional time irreversibility tests to heartbeat interval time
series over Multiple scales. The results provide strong evidence to
the concept that the asymmetry is an intrinsic property of heart rate
control system. As a simple and visual method, it is proved to be
effective in classifying physiologic and synthetic subjects while the
maximum scale is selected within a proper range, and also provides a
new way to analyze the time irreversibility for other high-dimensional
systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of the Main Constituents of Radix
Ilicis Pubescentis by LC-Coupled with DAD and ESI-MS Detection
SO NATURAL PRODUCT COMMUNICATIONS
AB A sensitive and selective high performance liquid chromatographic
method coupled with DAD detection is presented for quality control of
Radix Ilicis Pubescentis. By means of this analytical procedure the
major individual constituents (ilexoside O, ilexgenin A, ilexsaponin
A,, ilexsaponin B-1, liriodendin and acanthoside B) could be quantified
simultaneously. LC-ESI-MS was applied for identification of the six
compounds in the plant by comparing their m/z value and retention times
with those of selected standards. For quantitative analysis, the
extraction procedure and the extraction solvent were optimized in order
to ensure the exhaustive extraction of the plant material. The HPLC
conditions were evaluated and optimized for the exact quantification
of all six individual compounds. Chromatographic separation was
carried out on a C-18 column using gradient elution with acetonitrile
and 0.1% phosphoric acid as the mobile phase. Detection was carried
out using a photodiode array detector. The calibration curves for
determination of the six constituents showed good linearity over the
investigated ranges (r(2)>0.999). Measurement of intra-day and
inter-day variability (expressed as RSD value) was conducted to assess
precisions of the method, and RSD (%) of intra- and inter-day variation
were between 1.56-3.36% and 1.61-3.58%, respectively. The recoveries
of the six compounds were between 96.4-102.2%, with RSD (%) values
ranging from 1.7-3.8%. These validation results demonstrated the
suitability of the method for the precise and accurate determination
of the main constituents in Radix Ilicis Pubescentis. The method was
successfully applied for quality evaluation of 12 batches of Radix
Ilicis Pubescentis obtained from different regions of southern China.
The contents of the six major constituents varied significantly due
to their different origins, which can be used as an aid to assessing
the quality of Radix Ilicis Pubescentis.

TI Molecular-docking-guided 3D-QSAR studies of substituted
isoquinoline-1,3-(2H,4H)-diones as cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)
inhibitors
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING
AB The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are critical regulators of cell
cycle progression, and are involved in uncontrolled cell
proliferation-a hallmark of cancer. This suggests that small molecular
inhibitors of CDKs might be attractive as prospective antitumor agents.
To explore the relationship between the structures of substituted
isoquinoline-1,3-(2H, 4H)-diones and their inhibition of CDK4, 3D-QSAR
studies were performed on a dataset of 48 compounds. The bioactive
conformation of template compound 34 was obtained by performing
molecular docking into the ATP binding site of the homology model of
CDK4 and ranking by highest consensus score, which was then used to
build and align the rest of the molecules in the series. The constructed
comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) produces
significantly better results than comparative molecular field analysis
(CoMFA), with r(cv)(2) = 0.707 and r(2) = 0.988. The contours analysis
provides useful information about the structural requirements for
substituted isoquinoline-1,3-(2H, 4H)-diones for CDK4 inhibitory
activity.

SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Methanococcus jannaschii tRNA(Tyr)/tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase pair
has been engineered to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins
in Escherichia coli site-specifically In older to acid other unnatural
amino acids into proteins by this approach. the amino acid binding site
of M jannaschn tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase need to be mutated The crystal
structures of M.jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and Its maturation
were determined, which provided all opportunity to design
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific for Unnatural amino acids In our
Study. we attempted to design aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases being able
to deliver p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine into proteins
p-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine was Superimposed oil tyrosyl in M jannaschn
tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase-tyrosine complex Tyr32 needed to be changed
to non-polar amino acid with shorter side chain, Val, Leu, Ile, Gly
or Ala, in order to reduce steric clash and provide hydrophobic
environment to acetyl oil p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine Asp158 and Ile 159
Would be changed to specific amino acids for the same reason So we
designed 60 aminoacyl-rRNA synthetases. Binding of these
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine indicated
that only 15 of them turned Out to be able to bind
p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine with reasonable poses Binding affinity
computation proved that the mutation of Tyr32Leu and Asp158Gly
benefited p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine binding And two of the designed
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases had considerable binding affinities. They
seemed to be very promising to be able to incorporate
p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine into proteins in E coli The results show that
the combination of homology modeling and molecular docking is a
feasible method to filter inappropriate mutations in molecular design

TI HIV Protease Inhibitors Induce Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and
Disrupt Barrier Integrity in Intestinal Epithelial Cells
SO GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease
inhibitor (PI)-induced adverse effects have become a serious clinical
problem. In addition to their metabolic and cardiovascular
complications, these drugs also Frequently cause severe
gastrointestinal disorders, including mucosal erosions, epithelial
barrier dysfunction, and diarrhea. However, the exact mechanisms
underlying gastrointestinal adverse effects of HIV Pis remain unknown.
This study investigated whether HIV Pis disrupt intestinal epithelial
barrier integrity by activating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
METHODS: The most commonly used HIV Pis (lopinavir, ritonavir, and
amprenavir) were used; their effects on ER stress activation and
epithelial paracellular permeability were examined in vitro as well
as in vivo using wild-cype and CHOP-/- mice. RESULTS: Treatment with
lopinavir and ritonavir, but not amprenavir, induced ER stress, as
indicated by, I decrease in secreted alkaline phosphatase activities
and an increase in the unfolded protein response. This activated ER
stress partially impaired the epithelial barrier integrity by
promoting intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis. CHOP silencing by
specific small hairpin RNA prevented lopinavir- and ritonavir-induced
barrier dysfunction In Cultured intestinal epithelial cells, whereas
CHOP-/- mice exhibited decreased mucosal injury after exposure to
lopinavir and ritonavir. CONCLUSIONS: HIV PIs induce ER stress and
activate the unfolded protein response in intestinal epithelial cells,
thus resulting in disruption of the epithelial barrier integrity.

TI 3D-QSAR Studies of Arylcarboxamides with Inhibitory Activity on InhA
using Pharmacophore-Based Alignment
SO CHEMICAL BIOLOGY & DRUG DESIGN
AB Enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) is a promising target for
the development of antituberculosis drugs. The InhA-bound conformation
of an indole-5-amide inhibitor (Genz 10850) (PDB code: IP44) was used
to build a pharmacophore model by LigandScout. This model was then
successfully used to identify the bioactive conformation and align 40
structurally diverse arylcarboxamide derivatives. Comparative
molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity
indices analysis (CoMSIA) were performed on arylcarboxamides-based
InhA inhibitors based on pharmacophore alignment. The best prediction
was obtained with CoMSIA model combining steric and electrostatic
fields (r(cv)(2) = 0.729, r(2) = 0.972). The model was validated by
an external test set, which gave a good predictive value (r(pred)(2)
= 0.826). Graphical interpretation of the results revealed important
structural features of the zarylcarboxamides related to the active site
of InhA. The results may be exploited for further design and virtual
screening for some novel InhA inhibitors.
