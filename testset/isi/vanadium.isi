AB The reactions of one equivalent each of [VO(acac)(2)] and
   N-(2-pyridyl)-N'-(5-R-salicylidene)hydrazines (HphsalR) (derived front
   2-hydrazinopyridine and 5-substituted salicylaldehydes) in boiling
   acetonitrile under aerobic conditions provide ternary complexes of
   oxovanadium(IV) having the general formula [VO(phsalR)(acac)]. The
   complexes have been characterized by analytical, magnetic and
   spectroscopic measurements. The structures of two representative
   complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. In each
   structure, the metal centre is in a distorted octahedral N2O4
   coordination sphere. The tridentate phsalR(-) coordinates the metal ion
   via the pyridine-N, the imine-N and the phenolate-O atoms in a
   meridional fashion. The remaining three coordinations sites are
   occupied by the bidentate O,O-donor acetylacetonate (acac(-)) and the
   oxo group. In the crystal lattice, the molecules of each of the two
   complexes assemble to form one-dimensional supramolecular structure via
   intermolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot O=V hydrogen bond
   interaction. Electronic spectra collected using dimethylsulfoxide
   solutions of the complexes display a weak absorption within 643-720 nm
   due to d-d transition and some strong absorptions in the range 510-262
   nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer and ligand centred
   transitions. The room temperature (298 K) effective magnetic moments of
   the complexes in the solid state are consistent with an S = 1/2 ground
   state of the metal ion in each complex. All the complexes display axial
   EPR spectra with well-resolved V-51 hyperfine structure characteristic
   of an axially compressed octahedral coordination geometry around the
   metal centre. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   dimethylhydrazine (Hdmh) and N-trimethylsilyl-N'N'-dimethylhydrazine
   (Htdmh) at Ta, Zr and Hf was investigated aiming at volatile mixed
   ligand all-nitrogen coordinated compounds. The hydrazido ligands were
   introduced either by salt metathesis employing the Li salts of the
   hydrazines and the tetrachlorides MCl4 (M = Zr, Hf) or by amine
   substitution using M(NR2)(4) (R = Me, Et) and [(t-BuN)Ta(NR2)(3)]. The
   new complexes were fully characterised including H-1/C-13 NMR, mass
   spectrometry and a study of their thermal behaviour. The crystal
   structures of [ZrCl(tdmh)(3)] and the all-nitrogen coordinated complex
   [Ta(N-t-Bu)(NMe2)(2)-(tdmh)] are discussed as well as the structure of
   the by-product [Li(tdmh)(py)](2). Preliminary MOCVD experiments of the
   liquid compound [Ta(NEt2)(2)(N-t-Bu)(tdmh)] were performed and the
   deposited TaN(Si) films were analysed by RBS and SEM.

AB The chemical formulations containing strong reducing agents such as
   V(II) are kinetically effective for the reductive dissolution of iron
   oxides such as Fe3O4, Fe2O3, etc. To develop a methodology for
   large-scale synthesis of V(II), we report here the details of an
   electrolytic preparation on a pilot-plant scale (50 L). It is
   demonstrated that, by using stainless steel mesh cathode and anode in a
   poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-lined stainless steel tank, V(II) could be
   prepared. To minimize the electrolysis duration for the conversion of
   V(V) to V(II), laboratory studies are carried out for a preliminary
   reduction of V(V) to V(IV) with hydrazine or ascorbic acid and then
   employing V(IV) for electrolysis. Here, the use of hydrazine was
   advantageous (30% less time) over that of ascorbic acid. The V(II)
   obtained was complexed with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), and its
   stability and dissolution kinetics of Fe2O3 and Fe1.6Cr04O3 in the
   V-II-NTA formulation are reported.

   MECHANISM
AB The first detailed inhibition study of recombinant vanadium
   chloroperoxidase (rVCPO) using hydroxylamine, hydrazine and azide has
   been carried out. Hydroxylamine inhibits rVCPO both competitively and
   uncompetitively. The competitive inhibition constant K-ic and the
   uncompetitive inhibition constant K-iu are 40 and 80 muM, respectively.
   The kinetic data suggest that rVCPO may form a hydroxylamido complex,
   hydroxylamine also seems to react with the peroxovanadate complex
   during turnover. The kinetic data show that the type of inhibition for
   hydrazine and azide is uncompetitive with the uncompetitive inhibition
   constant K-iu of 350 muM and 50 nM, respectively, showing that in
   particular azide is a very potent inhibitor of this enzyme.
   Substitution of vanadate in the active site by phosphate also leads to
   inactivation of vanadium chloroperoxidase. However, the presence of
   H2O2 clearly prevents the inactivation of the enzyme by phosphate. This
   shows that pervanadate is bound much more strongly to the enzyme than
   vanadate. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   length 500 nm, with an inner diameter of 20 nm and an outer diameter of
   30 nm on average. Ethylene diamine's ability to achieve strong
   coordination and the presence of the reducing agent hydrazine hydrate
   aid the formation of Cu2-xSe nanotubes with mixed valence.

AB Vanadium (V) has recently been found to possess potent anti-neoplastic
   Activity in rat colon carcinogenesis. In the present study attempts
   have been made to investigate the expression of the number and area of
   aberrant crypt foci positive for placental glutathione S-transferase
   (GST-P) during 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (DMH)-induced rat colon
   carcinogenesis. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into
   four groups. Rats in group A were designed as normal controls. Group B
   animals received DMH once a week (20 mg/kg body wt.) intraperitoneally
   for 16 weeks. Group C rats received the same treatment of DMH as in
   group B, along with 0.5-ppm vanadium as ammonium monovanadate ad
   libitum in drinking water throughout the experiment. Vanadium alone was
   given to Group D rats without any DMH. injection. The expression of the
   number and the area of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) positive for GST-P was
   maximum in DMH-treated group. Vanadium-treated rats significantly
   reduced (P < 0.001) the expression of GST-P positive ACF cells (by
   71.13%) for the entire period of the study, Moreover the
   histopathological examination also showed that vanadium action could
   minimize the aberrant crypt foci (P < 0.001). Furthermore, vanadium
   supplementation also elevated SOD activities in both liver and colon (P
   < 0.01, P < 0.02 and P < 0.01, P < 0.02 respectively) when compared to
   their carcinogen counterparts. Our results confirm that vanadium is
   particularly effective in limiting the action of the carcinogen,
   thereby establishing its anticarcinogenicity in chemically induced rat
   colon carcinogenesis. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB AIM: To investigate the chemo preventive effects of vanadium on rat
   colorectal carcinogenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH).
   METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley Rats were randomly divided into four
   groups. Rats in Group A received saline vehicle alone for 16 weeks.
   Rats in Group B were given DMH injection once a week intraperitoneally
   for 16 weeks; rats in Group C, with the same DMH treatment as in the
   Group 13, but received 0.5-ppm vanadium in the form ammonium
   monovanadate ad libitum in drinking water. Rats in the Group D received
   vanadium alone as in the Group C without DMH injection.
   RESULTS: Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were formed in animals in
   DMH-treated groups at the end of week 16. Compared to DMH group,
   vanadium treated group had less ACF (P<0.001). At the end of week 32,
   all rats in DMH group developed large intestinal tumors. Rats treated
   with vanadium contained significantly few colonic adenomas and
   carcinomas (P<0.05) compared to rats administered DMH only. In
   addition, a significant reduction (P<0.05) in colon tumor burden (sum
   of tumor sizes per animal) was also evident in animals of Group C when
   compared to those in rats of carcinogen control Group B. The results
   also showed that vanadium significantly lowered PCNA index in ACF
   (P<0.005). Furthermore, vanadium supplementation also elevated liver
   GST and Cyt P-450 activities (P<0.001 and P<0.02, respectively).
   CONCLUSION: Vanadium in the form of ammonium monovanadate supplemented
   in drinking water ad libitum has been found to be highly effective in
   reducing tumor incidence and preneoplastic foci on DMH-induced
   colorectal carcinogenesis. These findings suggest that vanadium
   administration can suppress colon carcinogenesis in rats.

AB Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) is prepared by soft chemical routes
   (digestion either in ammonia or in hydrazine solutions) and is compared
   to a commercial sample. According to various characterization methods
   (XRD, HRTEM, DTA-TG, UV-visible diffuse reflectance, Raman and EPR
   spectroscopies), Nb2O5 shows particular bulk and surface properties.
   The phase transformation temperatures (amorphous --> pseudo-hexagonal,
   pseudo-hexagonal --> orthorhombic and orthorhombic --> monoclinic) for
   the synthetic Nb2O5 are about 100-150degreesC higher than for the
   commercial sample. The textural properties depend strongly on the
   preparation method. After calcination at 400degreesC, the sample
   prepared in ammonia has a larger pore volume (0.22 cm(3) g(-1)) and a
   better resistance to sintering at 600degreesC. The preparation in
   hydrazine gives the following advantages only if the gel is sonically
   redispersed in ethanol: low particle size, narrow size distribution,
   and higher resistance to sintering (140 m(2) g(-1) at 600degreesC).
   Preparation in ammonia or in hydrazine favors the formation of defects,
   characterized by a significant absorption in the visible range adjacent
   to the interband transition (3.4 eV, 360 nm). These defects, which
   disappear upon heating in oxygen, are identified as Nb4+ species and
   ionized oxygen vacancies as confirmed by EPR measurements. Finally, the
   nanoparticles obtained by sonication in ethanol (average particle size
   4.5 nm) shows a significant band gap increase ( from 3.4 eV to 4.2 eV)
   which is assigned to a quantum size effect.

AB Copper and silver nanocrystalline chalcogenides, Cu2-xSe, Cu2Te, Ag2Se,
   and Ag2Te, have been successfully synthesized in a mixture of
   ethylenediamine and hydrazine hydrate as a solvent at room temperature.
   Products showed different morphologies, such as nanotubes, nanorods,
   and nanoparticles. The results indicated that the coordination and
   chelation abilities of ethylenediamine play an important role in the
   formation of one-dimensional nanocrystalline binary chalcogenides, and
   hydrazine hydrate is crucial to the electron transfer in the room
   temperature reactions. These transition-metal nanocrystalline
   chalcogenides as prepared were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction,
   transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
   The UV-Vis absorption properties of these nanocrystals were also
   measured. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB The experiments of precursor preparation have been performed to
   investigate the effects of N2H4 . H2O/V2O5 mole ratio on catalytic
   performance of VPO catalyst for oxidation of n -butane to maleic
   anhydride (MA). For the catalyst samples prepared at higher mole ratio
   of N2H4 . H2O/V2O5, the quantity of (VO)(2)P2O7 (V4+) phase is
   considerably large, and the n -butane conversion is quite high. With
   the decrease of N2H4 . H2O/ V2O5 mole ratio in precursor preparation,
   the relative amount of delta-VOPO4,(V5+) phase increases progressively.
   The increase of V5+ phase strengthens the oxidation of the intermediate
   olefins, and then promotes the dehydrogenation of n -butane. Thus, the
   selectivity for MA increases at beginning, whereas the n -butane
   conversion increases continuously. When the V5+ phase reaches a given
   quantity, the overoxidation takes place, and the selectivity for MA
   begins to decrease. The yield of MA goes through a Maximum value at the
   optimal N2H4 . H2O/ V2.O5 mole ratio during the change of N2H4 .
   H2O/V2O5 mole ratio in precursor preparation from high to low. The
   catalyst sample prepared at N2H4 . H2O/V2O5 Mole ratio of 0.34 gave the
   maximum MA yield of 49.74% under the conditions of n -butane
   concentration of 4.0%, space velocity of 500 h(-1) and temperature of
   420degreesC. The catalyst of fine particle bed in this study belongs to
   the particles of group A. The catalyst fluidizes easily and behaves a
   larger flexibility for operation.

AB A highly selective, sensitive, and simple catalytic method for the
   determination of molybdenum in natural and waste waters was developed.
   It is based on the catalytic effect of Mo(VI) on the oxidation of
   2-aminophenol with H2O2. The reaction is monitored
   spectrophotometrically,by tracing the oxidation product at 430 nm after
   10 min of mixing the reagents. Addition of 800 mug . cm(-3) EDTA
   conferred high selectivity; however, interfering effects of Au(III),
   Cr(III), Cr(VI), and Fe(III) had to be eliminated by a reduction and
   co-precipitation procedure with SnCl2 and Al(OH)(3). Mo(VI) shows a
   linear calibration graph up to 11.0 ng . cm(-3); the detection limit,
   based on the 3S(b)-criterion, is 0.10 ng . cm(-3). The unique
   selectivity and sensitivity of the new method allowed its direct
   application to the determination of Mo(VI) in natural and waste waters.

AB The kinetics of oxidation of hydrazine and hydroxylamine have been

   order kinetics with respect to the reductant, but the rate has very
   little dependence on [V-V](t). The reactions are accelerated by H+ ion
   but the dependence of rate on [H+] is less than that corresponding to
   first order dependence. Under these conditions, the species, VO2+ is in
   equilibrium with decavanadate ions and the equilibrium accounts for the

AB Vanadium(III) and vanadium(V) complexes derived from the
   tris(2-thiolatoethyl)amine ligand [(NS3)(3-)] and the
   bis(2-thiolatoethyl)ether ligand [(OS2)(2-)] have been synthesized with
   the aim of investigating the potential of these vanadium sites to bind
   dinitrogen and activate its reduction. Evidence is presented for the
   transient existence of {V(NS3)(N-2)V(NS3)}, and a series of mononuclear
   complexes containing hydrazine, hydrazide, imide, ammine, organic
   cyanide, and isocyanide ligands has been prepared and the chemistry of
   these complexes investigated. [V(NS3)O] (1) reacts with an excess of
   N2H4 to give, probably via the intermediates {V(NS3)(NNH2)} (2a) and
   {V(NS3)(N-2)V(NS3)} (3), the V-III adduct [{V(NS3)(N2H4)}] (4). If 1 is
   treated with 0.5 mol of N2H4, 0.5 mol of N-2 is evolved and green,
   insoluble [{V(NS3)}(n)] (5) results. Compound 4 is converted by
   disproportionation to [V(NS3)-(NH3)- (NH3)](6), but 4 does not act as a
   catalyst for disproportionation of N2H4 nor does it act as a catalyst
   for its reduction by Zn/HOC6H3Pr2i-2,6. Compound 1 reacts with
   (NR2NR22)-N-1 (R-1 = H or SiMe3; R-2(2) = Me-2, MePh, or HPh) to give
   the hydrazide complexes [V(NS3)(NNR22)] (R-2(2) = Me-2, 2b; R-2(2) =
   MePh, 2c; R-2(2) HPh, 2d), which are not protonated by anhydrous HBr
   nor are they reduced by Zn/HOC6H3Pri2-2,6. Compound 2b can also be
   prepared by reaction of [V(NNMe2)(dipp)(3)] (dipp = OC6H3Pr2i-2,6) with
   NS3H3. N2H4 is displaced quantitatively from 4 by anions to give the
   salts [NR43][V(NS3)X] (X = Cl, R-3 = Et, 7a; X = Cl. R-3 = Ph, 7b; X =

   CN, R-3 = Et, 7f). Compound 6 loses NH3 thermally to give 5, which can
   also be prepared from [VCl3(THF)(3)] and NS3H3/LiBun. Displacement of
   NH3 from 6 by ligands L gives the adducts [V(NS3)(L)] (L = MeCN, nu(CN)

   nu(NC) 2173 cm(-1), 8c). Reaction of 4 with N3SiMe3 gives
   [V(NS3)(NSiMe3)] (9), which is converted to [V(NS3)(NH)] (10) by
   hydrolysis and to [V(NS3)(NCPh3)] (11) by reaction with ClCPh3.
   Compound 10 is converted into 1 by [NMe4]OH and to [V(NS3)NLi(THF)(2)]
   (12) by LiNPri in THF.
   A further range of imido complexes [V(NS3)(NR4)] (R-4 = C6H4Y-4, where

   (13i); C1(13j); R-4 = C6H11 (13k)) has been prepared by reaction of 1
   with (RNCO)-N-4. The precursor complex [V(OS2)O(dipp)] (14) [OS22- =
   O(CH2CH2S)(2)(2-)] has been prepared from [VO(OPri)(3)], Hdipp, and
   OS2H2 It reacts with NH2NMe2 to give [V(OS2)(NH2Me2)(dipp)] (15) and
   with NsSiMe(3) to give [V(OS2)(NSiMe3)(dipp)] (16). A second oxide
   precursor, formulated as [V(OS2)(1.5)O] (17), has also been obtained,
   and it reacts with SiMe3NHNMe2 to give [V(OS2)(NNMe2)(OSiMe3)] (18).

AB A sensitive kinetic spectrophotometric method has been developed for
   the determination of Se(IV) over the range of 45 to 4000 ng in 10 mt of

   reduction reaction of bromate by hydrazinium dichloride, with
   subsequent reaction of Ponceau S with products of the above reaction
   (chlorine and bromine),causing color changing of Ponceau S. Method
   development includes optimization of time interval for measurement of
   slope, pH, reagents concentration, and temperature. The optimized
   conditions yielded a theoretical detection limit of 33 ng/10 mt of
   solution of Se(IV). The interfering effects were studied and removed.
   The method was applied to the determination of selenium in spiked
   water, Kjeldahl tablet, selenium tablet, and shampoo. Vanadium(V) has
   an inhibition effect on the catalyzed reaction of bromate and hydrazine
   by selenium. Using this effect, V(V) can be determined in the range of
   70 to 2500 ng in 10 mt of solution. The optimization procedure includes
   pH and selenium concentration. An extraction method was used for
   interference removal. The method was applied to the determination of

   and Z = 2. In each complex the planar ligand binds the metal ion via
   phenolate-O, imine-N, and amide-O. The nitrogen of an acetonitrile
   molecule satisfies the fourth site of the square-plane containing the
   metal ion. In 1 the axial coordination is provided by the nitrogen of a
   second acetonitrile molecule, whereas in 2 one of the oxygen atoms of
   the perchlorate occupies the fifth axial site. The axial acetonitrile
   molecule of 1 is bound to the metal center in a bent mode. The other
   noticeable difference between the two structures is in the geometry at
   the metal center. A large displacement (0.23 Angstrom) of the metal ion
   from the ONON basal plane towards the axial coordinating atom is
   observed in 1. On the other hand, there is no displacement of the metal
   center from the same ONON basal plane in 2. The EPR and electronic
   spectral features in acetonitrile solutions are consistent with the
   solid state structures.

AB The development of a spectrophotometric method for the determination of
   hydrogen peroxide in uranyl nitrate solutions is reported. The method
   involves the measurement of the absorbance at 520 nm of a vanadyl

   extractant for organic phase samples. The method is simple and robust
   and tolerant of nitric acid and U(VI). Specificity and accuracy were
   improved by the application of solid phase extraction techniques to
   remove entrained organic solvents and Pu(IV). Reverse phase solid phase
   extraction was used to clean-up aqueous samples or extracts which were
   contaminated with entrained solvent. A solid phase extraction system
   based upon an extraction chromatography system was used to remove
   Pu(IV). Detection limits of 26 mu mol.dm(-3) (0.88 mu g.cm(-3)) or 7 mu
   mol.dm(-3) (0.24 mu g.cm(-3)) for, respectively, a 1 and 4 cm path
   length cell were obtained. Precisions of RSD = 1.4% and 19.5% were
   obtained at the extremes of the calibration curve (5 mmol.dm(-3) and 50
   mu mol.dm(-3) H2O2, 1 cm cell). The introduction of the extraction and
   clean-up stages had a negligible effect upon the precision of the
   determination. The stability of an organic phase sample was tested and
   no loss of analyte could be discerned over a period of at least 5 days.
   The presence of trace levels of reductants interfered with the
   determination, e.g., hydrazine (<2 mmol.dm(-3)), but this effect was
   ameliorated by increasing the concentration of the colormetric reagent.

AB The effect of aluminium on vanadium-mediated oxidation of NADH was
   examined. The oxidation of NADH was enhanced in the presence of
   aluminium. The effect was concentration dependent. Vitamin E and copper
   (II) complexes with superoxide dismutase (COD)-like activities
   containing isobutyric acid hydrazine were rested for their effect on
   the vanadium-mediated oxidation of NADH. The stimulatory effect of
   aluminium was decreased upon addition of different concentrations of
   vitamin E and copper (II) complexes. These results indicate that the
   biological toxicity of aluminium may be attributed to its enhancement
   of the production of superoxide radicals (O-2(.-)) in association with
   the accumulation of other trace elements such as vanadium.

AB Clusters with the [MFe(3)S(4)](n+) core, (M = Mo, n=3; M = V, n=2). are
   used as catalysts for the reduction of substrates relevant to
   nitrogenase function. Substrates such as hydrazine and acetylene, are
   catalytically reduced by (NEt(4))(2)[(Cl-4-cat)(CH3CN)MoFe3S4Cl3], I,
   to ammonia and ethylene respectively, in the presence of added protons
   and reducing equivalents. Hydrazine also is catalytically reduced by
   the (NEt(4))[(DMF)(3)VFe3S4Cl3] cubane under similar conditions.
   Catalysis in excess of 100 turnovers (for hydrazine reduction) and in
   excess of 15 turnovers (for acetylene reduction) has been observed over
   a period of 24 hours. Kinetic studies of the acetylene reduction
   reaction have been carried out. Considerable evidence has been amassed
   which directly implicates the Mo and V atoms as the primary catalytic
   sites. The reduction of hydrazine is accelerated in the presence of
   carboxylate ligands bound to the Mo atom in I and this effect is
   interpreted in terms of a proton delivery shuttle involving the
   carboxylate group and the substrate during reduction. The possible role
   of the homocitrate ligand in the nitrogen cofactor is analyzed in terms
   of these findings.

AB Reactivity studies of clusters that contain the MFe(3)S(4) cores (M =
   Mo, V) with catecholate, multicarboxylate (or DMF) ligands coordinated
   to the Mo (or V) atoms, and Cl ligands coordinated to the Fe atoms have
   been carried out. These studies show the M/Fe/S single cubane clusters
   to be effective catalysts in the reduction of nitrogenase substrates
   such as hydrazine, acetylene and protons to give ammonia, ethylene and
   dihydrogen respectively. The same molecules do not activate or catalyze
   the reduction of dinitrogen. The results indicate that the observed
   catalyses are occurring at the Mo (V) sites by a process that, in the
   case of hydrazine, involves substrate protonation prior to reduction.
   The facile catalytic reduction of hydrazine by clusters that contain
   coordinatively saturated polycarboxylate-bound Mo atoms is rationalized
   in terms of a possible protonation/proton delivery function of the
   coordinated polycarboxylate ligands. The reactivity characteristics of
   the M/Fe/S clusters (structurally quite similar to the nitrogenase
   cofactor) have led to the suggestion that the Mo (V) atoms may be
   involved in the reduction of hydrazine in the later stages of
   dinitrogen reduction.

AB The catalytic activity in the reduction of NO by ammonia in the
   presence of oxygen (SCR process) is reported for CuO-TiO2 and for
   different catalysts belonging to the MgO-Fe2O3 system. These materials
   show high activity even at relatively low temperatures, with a maximum
   NO conversion near 520 K (CuO-TiO2) and 600 K (MgO-Fe2O3). At higher
   temperatures, NO conversion is reduced because of the competitive NH3
   oxidation by O-2 to NOx and N-2. The adsorption and transformation of
   ammonia over these systems has been investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy
   in vacuum and in contact with oxygen and NO. In all cases ammonia is
   first coordinated over Lewis sites and later undergoes hydrogen
   abstraction giving rise either to NH2 amide species or to its dimeric
   form N2H4, hydrazine, detected over CuO-TiO2 and gamma-Fe2O3. Other
   species tentatively identified as imide NH, nitroxyl HNO, nitrogen
   anions N-2(-) and azide anions N-3(-) are produced further. In the
   presence of NO3- coordinated ammonia rapidly disappears, the above
   intermediates are not found, and water is produced, showing that the
   SCR reaction occurred. Ammonia protonation to ammonium ion is not
   detected at all over these systems. It seems consequently demonstrated
   that Bronsted acidity is not necessary for the appearance of SCR
   activity. A comparison with the previously-published data on

   and VCl2(acpn), acpn = propylendiimino-bis(acetylacetonato(2-)), with
   benzoylhydrazine. The structures of the centrosymmetric dimeric
   molecules 1-3 have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction.
   1 and 2 contain both doubly deprotonated N,N'-dibenzoylhydrazine as
   bridging, doubly N,O chelating ligand. In 1 the two remaining
   coordination sites at the VOCl group are occupied by the hydrazido(1-)
   ligand [NHNHCOPh](-). 2 is a non-ore vanadium(IV) complex. The
   coordination geometry is approximately trigonal prismatic. The pi-back
   donating effect of the oxo function is substituted by back donation
   from three negatively charged enolic oxygen atoms. The V-O bond lengths
   range from 192.0(2) to 193.7(2) pm. 3 contains a unique highly
   symmetrical octadentate ligand, formed during the synthesis. It is
   coordinated to two oxovanadin(IV) centers by N,O chelation. The
   coordination geometry is square pyramidal.

AB The catalytic behavior of synthetic Fe/V/S clusters that structurally
   resemble the Fe/V/S site of nitrogenase is reported. The
   [(L)(L')(L'')VFe3S4Cl3](n-) clusters (L, L', L'' = DMF, n = 1; L =
   PEt(3), L', L'' = DMF, n = 1; L, L' = 2,2'-bipyridyl, L'' = DMF, n = 1)
   that contain the [VFe3S4](2-) cuboidal core are effective catalysts in
   the reduction of hydrazine (a nitrogenase substrate) to ammonia in the
   presence of cobaltocene and 2,6-lutidine hydrochloride as sources of
   electrons and protons, respectively. Reactivity studies show that
   V-coordinated terminal ligands have a profound effect on the relative
   rates of hydrazine reduction. Specifically, as the number of labile
   solvent molecules coordinated to the V atom decreases, the relative
   rate of hydrazine reduction decreases. The behavior also is observed
   with the [(HBpz3)VFe3S4Cl3](2-) cubane (L, L', L'' =
   hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate, n = 2), where all coordination sites on the
   V atom are ''blocked''. The latter shows no catalytic or stoichiometric
   hydrazine reduction and its structure has been determined. To
   investigate the role of the Fe sites in the [VFe3S4](2+) cubanes during
   catalysis, a series of cubanes [(DMF)(3)VFe(3)S(4)X(3)](-) (X = Cl-,
   Br-, or I-) was synthesized. Relative rates of hydrazine reduction with
   each catalyst were virtually identical, indicating little or no
   involvement of the Fe atoms during catalysis. The result's of this
   study strongly implicate the heterometal (V) as the site directly
   involved in the binding and activation of hydrazine. Additionally,
   reduction of phenylhydrazine to ammonia and aniline is observed in
   these systems. Importantly, the single cubane
   (Me(4)N)[(PhHNNH(2))(bpy)VFe3S4Cl3] has been synthesized, indicating
   the ability of a hydrazine-like substrate molecule to interact directly
   with the V atom. These reactivity studies are compared to those
   communicated previously for the reduction of hydrazine by the
   [MoFe3S4](3+) cuboidal core. Additionally, a plausible reaction pathway
   for the reduction of hydrazine-like substrates by the [VFe3S4](2+) core
   is presented. Implications regarding the function of the Fe/M/S (M = V,
   Mo) center in nitrogenase are discussed.

   two H2O molecules at the apices of a pentagonal bipyramide, the anion
   contains the doubly deprotonated hydrazido(2-) ligand NHNCOPh(2-) as
   N,O-chelate. 2 and 3 have very similar structures, but differ in the
   oxidation state of the vanadium atom and in the degree of deprotonation
   of the hydrazine. In 3 neutral NH(2)NHCOOMe and in 2 the single
   deprotonated hydrazido(1-) ligand NHNHCOOMe- are bound as N,O-chelates,
   with the O-donor in trans-position to the VO group. The remaining

   is favoured by prior lithium intercalation. Alkylamines form double
   layers in the interlayer space between consecutive VSe2 slabs. Also,
   lithium is not exchanged with alkylammonium ions, but is largely
   retained in the form of solvated ions. The angle between the amine
   molecules and the host lattice layers is constant for the solvated ions
   but increases gradually with the size of the organic molecules in the
   alkylamine intercalates.

AB During the reduction of N, by V-nitrogenase at 30-degrees-C, some
   hydrazine (N2H4) is formed as a product in addition to NH3 [Dilworth
   and Eady (I 99 1) Biochem. J. 277, 465-468]. We show here the
   following. (1) That over the temperature range 30-45-degrees-C the
   apparent K(m) for the reduction of N2 to yield these products is the
   same, but increases from 30 to 58 kPa of N2. On increasing the
   temperature from 45-degrees-C to 50-degrees-C, little change occurred
   in the rate of reduction of protons to H-2; the rate of N2H4 production
   increased, but the rate of NH3 formation decreased 7-fold. (2)
   Temperature-shift experiments from 42 to 50-degrees-C or from 50 to
   42-degrees-C showed that this selective loss of the ability to reduce
   N2 to NH3 was reversible. The effects we observe are consistent with
   the existence of different conformers of the VFe-protein at the two
   temperatures, that predominating at 50-degrees-C being largely unable
   to reduce N2 to ammonia. (3) Measurement of the ratio between H-2
   evolution and N2 reduced to NH3 at N2 pressures up to 339 kPa for both
   Mo- and V-nitrogenases gave limiting H-2/N2 values of 1.13 +/- 0.13 for
   Mo-nitrogenase and 3.50 +/- 0.03 for V-nitrogenase. Since for
   Mo-nitrogenase our measured value for the ratio at 339 kPa is the same
   as that derived by Simpson and Buff is [(l 984) Science 224, 1095-1097]
   at 5650 kPa, there appears to be little or no divergence from the
   predictions based on the apparent K(m) for N2. These data then suggest
   that there may be a fundamentally different mechanism for N2 binding to
   V-nitrogenase compared with Mo-nitrogenase. (4) We did not detect any
   N2H4 as a product of N2 reduction by Mo-nitrogenase over the
   temperature range investigated; however, at 50-degrees-C this system
   reduced acetylene (C2H2) to yield some ethane (C2H6), in addition to
   ethylene (C2H4), a reaction normally associated with Mo-independent
   nitrogenases.

AB During the enzymic reduction of N2 to NH3 by Mo-nitrogenase, free
   hydrazine (N2H4) is not detectable, but an enzyme-bound intermediate
   can be made to yield N2H4 by quenching the enzyme during turnover
   [Thorneley, Eady & Lowe (1978) Nature (London) 272, 557-558].  In
   contrast, we show here that the V-nitrogenase of Azotobacter
   chroococcum produces a small but significant amount of free N2H4 (up to
   0.5% of the electron flux resulting in N2 reduction) as a product of
   the reduction of N2.  The amount of N2H4 formed increased 15-fold on
   increasing the assay temperature from 20-degrees-C to 40-degrees-C. 
   Activity cross-reactions between nitrogenase components of Mo- and
   V-nitrogenases showed that the formation of free N2H4 was associated
   with the VFe protein.  These data provide the first direct evidence for
   an enzyme intermediate at the four-electron-reduced level during the
   reduction of N2 by V-nitrogenase.

   (salen) or N,N' -1,2-phenylenebis-(salicylideneiminate)(salphen), X =
   Cl or Br] have been prepared by established routes, but attempts to
   prepare the iodo-analogue led to other products, including
   [(salen)V(mu-m-O)VO(salen)][l(5)].  It is not possible to prepare
   hydrazine or hydrazide complexes directly from the dihalides, but
   [V(NH2NHPh)2-(salen)]\ was synthesised by an indirect route, and its
   structure determined by X-ray analysis.  The phenylhydrazines are bound
   end-on.  Several other new vanadium-(lll) and (lV) species are
   described.
