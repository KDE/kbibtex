AB This study examines the connections between familiar (influenza) and
   unfamiliar (SARS) risks among the general public in a SARS affected
   society. Using a survey of 350 respondents in Chonju, we find that risk
   perceptions and a belief that influenza vaccination reduces the
   incidence of SARS explain behavioral intentions for influenza
   vaccination and purchase responses to a hypothetical SARS vaccine.
   Those respondents who believe that an influenza vaccination will very
   likely reduce SARS incidence have a high probability (79%) of intending
   to vaccinate, but a much lower WTP for a SARS vaccine than those
   without such a belief. This belief undoubtedly was influenced by a
   reframing of influenza vaccination as preventing SARS. Such reframing
   may lead to short-term improvements in vaccination rates to the
   detriment of long-term SARS vaccination development. When compared with
   a similar study in Taiwan, societal risk perceptions of SARS and WTP
   for a vaccine vary greatly according to the extent of a society's
   experience with SARS.
