AB Hybridization of cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii with
   nonindigenous rainbow trout O. mykiss contributes to the decline of
   cutthroat trout subspecies throughout their native range. Introgression
   by rainbow trout can swamp the gene pools of cutthroat trout
   populations, especially if there is little selection against hybrids.
   We used rainbow trout, Yellowstone cutthroat trout O. clarkii bouvieri,
   and rainbow trout x Yellowstone cutthroat trout F-1 hybrids as parents
   to construct seven different line crosses: F-1 hybrids (both reciprocal
   crosses), F-2 hybrids, first-generation backcrosses (both rainbow trout
   and Yellowstone cutthroat trout), and both parental taxa. We compared
   growth, morphology, and developmental instability among these seven
   crosses reared at two different temperatures. Growth was related to the
   proportion of rainbow trout genome present within the crosses. Meristic
   traits were influenced by maternal, additive, dominant, overdominant,
   and (probably) epistatic genetic effects. Developmental stability,
   however, was not disturbed in F-1 hybrids, F-2 hybrids, or backcrosses.
   Backcrosses were morphologically similar to their recurrent parent. The
   lack of developmental instability in hybrids suggests that there are
   few genetic incompatibilities preventing introgression. Our findings
   suggest that hybrids are not equal: that is, growth, development,
   character traits, and morphology differ depending on the genomic
   contribution from each parental species as well as the hybrid
   generation.

TI Stochastic differential equation models for ion channel noise in
   Hodgkin-Huxley neurons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID ACTION-POTENTIALS; SIMULATION; PRECISION; KINETICS; BEHAVIOR
AB The random transitions of ion channels between conducting and
   nonconducting states generate a source of internal fluctuations in a
   neuron, known as channel noise. The standard method for modeling the
   states of ion channels nonlinearly couples continuous-time Markov
   chains to a differential equation for voltage. Beginning with the work
   of R. F. Fox and Y.-N. Lu [Phys. Rev. E 49, 3421 (1994)], there have
   been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic
   differential equation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking
   activity produced by Markov chain models. Recent numerical
   investigations, however, have raised doubts that SDE models can capture
   the stochastic dynamics of Markov chain models.
   We analyze three SDE models that have been proposed as approximations
   to the Markov chain model: one that describes the states of the ion
   channels and two that describe the states of the ion channel subunits.
   We show that the former channel-based approach can capture the
   distribution of channel noise and its effects on spiking in a
   Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a degree not previously demonstrated,
   but the latter two subunit-based approaches cannot. Our analysis
   provides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why this is the
   case. The temporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by
   the combinatorics of bundling subunits into channels, but the
   subunit-based approaches do not correctly account for this structure.
   Our study confirms and elucidates the findings of previous numerical
   investigations of subunit-based SDE models. Moreover, it presents
   evidence that Markov chain models of the nonlinear, stochastic dynamics
   of neural membranes can be accurately approximated by SDEs. This
   finding opens a door to future modeling work using SDE techniques to
   further illuminate the effects of ion channel fluctuations on
   electrically active cells.

TI Dissipative soliton resonance in a passively mode-locked fiber laser
SO OPTICS LETTERS

DT Article
ID LOCKING MODEL; ENERGY; OSCILLATORS
AB The phenomenon of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR) predicts that an
   increase of pulse energy by orders of magnitude can be obtained in
   laser oscillators. Here, we prove that DSR is achievable in a realistic
   ring laser cavity using nonlinear polarization evolution as the
   mode-locking mechanism, whose nonlinear transmission function is
   adjusted through a set of waveplates and a passive polarizer. The
   governing model accounts explicitly for the arbitrary orientations of
   the waveplates and the polarizer, as well as the gain saturation in the
   amplifying medium. It is shown that DSR is achievable with realistic
   laser settings. Our findings provide an excellent design tool for
   optimizing the mode-locking performance and the enhancement of energy
   delivered per pulse by orders of magnitude. (C) 2011 Optical Society of

AB A generalized master mode-locking model is presented to characterize
   the pulse evolution in a ring cavity laser passively mode-locked by a
   series of waveplates and a polarizer, and the equation is referred to
   as the sinusoidal Ginzburg-Landau equation (SGLE). The SGLE gives a
   better description of the cavity dynamics by accounting explicitly for
   the full periodic transmission generated by the waveplates and
   polarizer. Numerical comparisons with the full dynamics show that the
   SGLE is able to capture the essential mode-locking behaviors including
   the multi-pulsing instability observed in the laser cavity and does not
   have the drawbacks of the conventional master mode-locking theory, and
   the results are applicable to both anomalous and normal dispersions.
   The SGLE model supports high energy pulses that are not predicted by
   the master mode-locking theory, thus providing a platform for
   optimizing the laser performance.

AB The objective of this study was to determine if there is evidence for a
   causative link between sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol and
   risky sex for men in substance abuse treatment. Men in treatment
   participating in a multisite HIV prevention protocol who reported on
   baseline, 3, or 6 months computerized assessments the details of their
   most recent sexual events, and who reported having sexual events under
   the influence and not under the influence, and who reported most recent
   events that did and did not include condom use served as participants
   (n = 37). Safe sex was not significantly more likely to happen when
   participants were under the influence of drugs or alcohol during their
   most recent sexual event (48.3%) than when they were not under the
   influence (49%, p = .82). In this high-risk in treatment sample, a
   causative link between sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol and
   sexual risk behavior was not supported. (Am J Addict 2011;00:1--7).
