AB The treatment of choice for acute venous thromboembolism is
   anticoagulant therapy with fast-acting drugs (Unfractionated or
   low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux) aimed at preventing
   thrombus extension, followed by extended prophylaxis with vitamin K
   antagonists aimed at preventing recurrence. Experience accumulated over
   the years has demonstrated that strict laboratory monitoring is
   required for unfractionated heparin and vitamin K antagonists, making
   use of these drugs problematic for patients and physicians and
   prompting researchers to develop new anticoagulants equally effective
   but without the requirement for laboratory monitoring. The results of
   clinical trials to date, albeit limited, suggest that these new drugs
   will probably keep their promise. However, the definitive answer will
   come subsequent to these clinical trials, when clinicians will start to
   use these drugs to treat patients in the real world. It is likely that
   some sort of laboratory monitoring will be required at least for
   selected categories of patients. Accordingly, clinical laboratories
   should still be prepared to monitor patients, although the numbers may
   hopefully decrease sharply in the next decade or so.

ID THERAPY; SYSTEM
AB Computer-assisted oral anticoagulant dosage is being increasingly used
   to meet growing demands for oral anticoagulation. The DAWN AC is one of
   the most widely used computer-dosage programs. Evidence of its value
   and that of other computer programs has been based previously only on
   laboratory evidence of "time in target INR range" (TIR) not on clinical
   safety in practice. A five-year international randomised clinical study
   of computer assistance with the DAWN AC program compared with manual
   dosage in 2,631 patients has been performed at 13 centres with
   established expertise in oral anticoagulation mainly in the EU. Safety
   assessment have been based on the comparison of bleeding or thrombotic
   events with DAWN AC compared with manual dosage in a randomised study.
   Safety of the DAWN AC program has been demonstrated. Clinical events of
   bleeding and thrombosis were almost identical with the experienced
   manual dosage group. Therapeutic control improved with DAWN AC to 66.8%
   from 63.4% TIR. The program failed to provide a dosage recommendation
   on only 5.7% of occasions. At a group of experienced centres with a
   special interest in oral anticoagulation, the DAWN AC computer-dosage
   program proved as safe clinically as manual dosage by experienced
   medical staff. With DAWN AC, laboratory control was improved, the
   difference being highly significant. The results should reassure
   hospitals and community clinics that the DAWN AC program is safe and
   facilitate greater and longer provision of warfarin treatment where
   required.

ID PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
AB The new CoaguChek XS system is designed for use in patient self testing
   with a measuring range from 0.8 INR up to 8.0 INR, which has been
   calibrated against the mean INR of rTF/95 and ERM-AD149. This study was
   performed to confirm the correct INR results received from two
   routinely manufactured lots of test strips when compared with the
   international reference preparations (IRP) rTF/95 and ERM-AD149. At one
   study site capillary and noncitrated venous whole blood samples from 20
   normal donors and 62 anticoagulated patients were applied to two test
   strip lots of the new system in duplicate. Additionally blood was
   collected in citrate tubes, processed to plasma, and PT results were
   obtained using rTF/95 and ERM-AD149 by the manual tilt tube method.
   Method comparisons of the INR results of the CoaguChek XS system vs.
   the mean INR of the IRP demonstrated a mean relative bias of -0.02% to
   -0.4%, mean absolute relative deviations of 6.4-9.6%, and accuracy
   observing > 95% of CoaguChek XS INR within limits of +/- 14% to +/-
   21.5% to the mean INR of the IRP. The results of the study confirm the
   successful calibration of two lots of the new CoaguChek XS system,
   demonstrate the validity of the calibration concept and prove the
   accuracy of the new system in comparison with the IRP. Clinical
   decisions in oral anticoagulation therapy may be reliably made upon the
   INR results of the new system.

AB The CoaguChek S system is designed for use in patient self-testing. In
   this system a whole blood sample without sodium citrate is applied to a
   test strip containing thromboplastin and iron oxide particles. The
   detection principle is based on fibrin formation which inhibits and
   finally stops the movement of the iron oxide particles. In the classic
   prothrombin time (PT) test,citrate plasma is mixed with thromboplastin
   and an excess of calcium ions. In the monitoring of vitamin
   K-antagonist (VKA) treatment, all results are expressed on a common
   scale, i.e. international normalised ratio (INR). In patients on
   long-term VKA treatment, INRs were determined by the CoaguChek S system
   and reference methods for the classic PT Four different CoaguChek S
   strip lots were evaluated. The difference in INR between the reference
   PT and the CoaguChek S system was negatively correlated to the
   haematocrit of the patients. We conclude that INR differences between
   CoaguChek S and plasma PT may be explained in part by the haematocrit.
   The magnitude of the effect of haematocrit, within the reference
   interval of 0.37-0.51,on the INR difference was not greater than
   approximately 10% for the combined data of the four strip lots. A bias
   of less than 10% seems to be acceptable clinically.

   the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17593:2007
   standard "Clinical laboratory testing and in vitro medical devices -
   Requirements for in vitro monitoring systems for self-testing of oral
   anticoagulant therapy". The monitor under investigation was the new
   CoaguChek XS system which is designed for use in patient self testing.
   Its detection principle is based on the amperometric measurement of the
   thrombin activity generated by starting the coagulation cascade using a
   recombinant human thromboplastin.
   Methods: The system performance verification study was performed at
   four study centers using venous and capillary blood samples on two test
   strip lots. Laboratory testing was performed from corresponding frozen
   plasma samples with six commercial thromboplastins. Samples from 73
   normal donors and 297 patients on oral anticoagulation therapy were
   collected. Results were assessed using a refined data set of 260
   subjects according to the ISO 17593:2007 standard.
   Results: Each of the two test strip lots met the acceptance criteria of
   ISO 17593:2007 versus all thromboplastins (bias -0.19 to 0.18 INR; >
   97% of data within accuracy limits). The coefficient of variation for
   imprecision of the PT determinations in INR ranged from 2.0% to 3.2% in
   venous, and from 2.9% to 4.0% in capillary blood testing. Capillary
   versus venous INR data showed agreement of results with regression
   tines equal to the tine of identity.
   Conclusion: The new system demonstrated a high level of trueness and
   accuracy, and low imprecision in INR testing. It can be concluded that
   the CoaguChek XS system complies with the requirements in chapter 8 of
   the ISO standard 17593:2007. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO RESEARCH POLICY

   NETWORKS
AB The use of computer-mediated communications in research is one of the
   major shifts in processes of scientific knowledge production. We ask
   the question whether there are distinct disciplinary online
   communication patterns. In particular, we hypothesize that Mode 2
   sciences have a higher use of Internet applications and address a
   greater variety of audiences with a greater variety of research outputs
   than Mode 1 sciences. Mode 2 was introduced as a descriptive and
   diagnostic characterization of transitions in knowledge production that
   are characterized by a range of features such as interdisciplinarity,
   reflexivity, focus on the context of application, heterogeneous actors,
   and a wide variety of types of output. This new mode of knowledge
   production has supposedly evolved out of the disciplinary and academic
   context of traditional ways in which knowledge was produced. It
   involves different mechanisms of generating and of communicating
   knowledge, more actors who come from different disciplines, and
   different sites in which knowledge is being produced.
   We analyze online communication patterns in eight scientific
   disciplines including four Mode 1 sciences (High Energy Physics,
   Astrophysics, Literature Studies, and Psychology) and four Mode 2
   sciences (Genetics, Biotechnology, Computer Science, and Information
   Science). We collected data on several dimensions of online
   communications, which included the shared set of outlinks of the
   departments and the characteristics of the websites in terms of size
   and types of files. The results suggest that web-based communications
   play a role in obtaining informational and financial resources, the use
   and exchange of digital data, the dissemination of results to academic
   audiences, and the dissemination of (non-traditional) output. The
   Internet maintains the three Mode 2 aspects of knowledge production:
   the interaction with non-academic partners, the dissemination of
   non-traditional output (software tools, databases, etc.), and the use
   of digital data. However, these characteristics of Mode 2 can be traced
   in different web attributes in each field. There is no systematic
   relationship between the three Mode 2 elements and the web
   characteristics under study here across all fields. This questions the
   usefulness of the Mode 2 label and underlines the specificity of
   scientific disciplines. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To meet growing demand for oral anticoagulation worldwide there has
   been increased dependence on computer-assistance in dosage although the
   safety and effectiveness of any of the individual computer-assisted
   dosage programs has not previously been established. This randomised
   multicentre clinical end-point study assessed a new version of the
   PARMA 5 program. It compared PARMA 5 safety and effectiveness with
   manual dosage by experienced medical staff at 19 centres with a known
   interest in oral anticoagulation. Target recruitment was 8000
   patient-years, randomised to medical staff or PARMA-5 assisted dosage.
   Safety and effectiveness of the PARMA 5 program was compared with
   manual dosage. A total of 10 421 patients were recruited (15 369
   patient-years) in the 5-year study. International normalised ratio
   (INR) tests numbered 167 791 with manual and 160 078 with PARMA 5
   dosage. With PARMA 5 there was overall a non-significant reduction in
   clinical events but in the 2542 patients with deep vein
   thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, clinical events were significantly
   reduced (P = 0 005). Success in achieving 'time in target INR range'
   was also significantly greater with PARMA 5 compared with the dosage by
   experienced medical staff. This study demonstrated the safety and
   effectiveness of PARMA 5-assisted dosage.

AB Context. A significant fraction of binary stars consisting of a white
   dwarf and a low-mass main-sequence star (red dwarf) are expected to be
   close binaries that are the end products of common-envelope (CE)
   evolution. Aims. To gain a better understanding of CE evolution, we
   want to study white dwarf-red dwarf binaries. For this it is
   fundamental to establish a well-defined sample.
   Methods. To reduce contamination by more distant sources, such as
   quasars, we have selected candidate white dwarf-red dwarf binaries from
   the catalogue of proper motion stars drawn from the intersection of the
   Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the USNO-B1.0 catalogue. To
   separate single from binary sources and to cut spurious sources out, we
   define selection criteria based on a combination of the (u - g), (g -
   r), and (r - i) colours.
   Results. We evaluate and discuss the selection criteria on the basis of
   both the publicly available SDSS spectra and the predicted colours of
   white dwarf-red dwarf binaries. We define a sample of 651 binary
   candidates. However, we find that for r magnitudes brighter than
   similar to 16.5 the proper motion catalogue is heavily contaminated
   with sources that have incorrect colours due to the r magnitudes being
   relatively too faint, most likely due to saturation effects.
   Conclusions. We show that the level of contamination can be reduced by
   either excluding sources brighter than r = 16.5 mag or by excluding
   sources bluer than (u - g) = - 0.5 or (g - r) = -0.6 and brighter than
   r = 16.0 mag. We expect similar to 85% of the remaining sources to be
   genuine white dwarf-red dwarf binaries. We estimate that we exclude
   similar to 5-10% of the white dwarf-red dwarf binaries in the proper
   motion catalogue.

AB The INT/WFC Photometric H alpha Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane
   (IPHAS) is an imaging survey being carried out in H alpha, r'and i'
   filters, with the Wide Field Camera (WFC) on the 2.5-m Isaac Newton
   Telescope (INT) to a depth of r' = 20 (10 sigma). The survey is aimed
   at revealing the large scale organization of the Milky Way and can be
   applied to identifying a range of stellar populations within it.
   Mapping emission line objects enables a particular focus on objects in
   the young and old stages of stellar evolution ranging from early
   T-Tauri stars to late planetary nebulae. In this paper we present the
   IPHAS Initial Data Release, primarily a photometric catalogue of about
   200 million unique objects, coupled with associated image data covering
   about 1600 deg(2) in three passbands. We note how access to the primary
   data products has been implemented through use of standard virtual
   observatory publishing interfaces. Simple traditional web access is
   provided to the main IPHAS photometric catalogue, in addition to a
   number of common catalogues (such as 2MASS) which are of immediate
   relevance. Access through the AstroGrid VO Desktop opens up the full
   range of analysis options, and allows full integration with the wider
   range of data and services available through the Virtual Observatory.
   The IDR represents the largest data set published primarily through VO
   interfaces to date, and so stands as an exemplar of the future of
   survey data mining. Examples of data access are given, including a
   cross-matching of IPHAS photometry with sources in the UKIDSS Galactic
   Plane Survey that validates the existing calibration of the best data.

AB Background: Increased demand for oral anticoagulants is overwhelming
   facilities worldwide, resulting in increasing use of computer
   assistance. A multicenter clinical endpoint study has been performed to
   compare the safety and effectiveness of computer-assisted dosage with
   dosage by experienced medical staff at the same centers. Methods: A
   randomized study of dosage of two commercial computer-assisted dosage
   programs (PARMA 5 and DAWN AC) vs. manual dosage at 32 centers with an
   established interest in oral anticoagulation in 13 countries. The aim
   was to recruit a minimum of 16 000 patient-years randomized to medical
   staff or computer-assisted dosage. In total, 13 219 patients
   participated, 6503 patients being randomized to medical staff and 6716
   to computer-assisted dosage. The safety and effectiveness of
   computer-assisted dosage were compared with those of medical staff
   dosage. Results: In total, 13 052 patients were recruited (18 617
   patient-years). International Normalized Ratio (INR) tests numbered 193
   890 with manual dosage and 193 424 with computer-assisted dosage. The
   number of clinical events with computer-assisted dosage was lower (P =
   0.1), but in the 3209 patients with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary
   embolism, they were reduced by 37 (24%, P = 0.001). Time in target INR
   range was significantly improved by computer assistance as compared
   with medical staff dosage at the majority of centers (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The safety and effectiveness of computer-assisted dosage
   has been demonstrated using two different marketed programs in
   comparison with experienced medical staff dosage at the centers with
   established interest in anticoagulation. Significant prevention of
   clinical events in patients with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary
   embolism and the achievement of target INR in all clinical groups has
   been observed. The reliability and safety of other marketed
   computer-assisted dosage programs need to be established.

DT Article
AB In this paper, we develop indicators for the responsiveness of the
   research system to the changing knowledge needs that follow from
   changes in social and policy priorities. In this paper we use coastal
   defense research as a case. Using four different approaches - an
   analysis of coastal defense policy documents to identify the demand
   knowledge; a document analysis to identify the Netherlands' coastal
   research field; a bibliometrie analysis; and a focus group with
   involved practitioners, researchers and intermediary actors - we
   identified the main demand for coastal defense research, the way the
   research system responds to it, as well as the bottlenecks that hinder
   optimal responsiveness of the research system.

AB Despite its relevance for research funding, few comparable data are
   available in official R&D statistics on the amount and composition of
   project funding. This paper discusses in detail the methodology
   developed in the European Network of Excellence on Research and
   Innovation Policies PRIME for systematically producing indicators on
   public project funding which allow for comparative analysis between
   different countries and across periods of time. We introduce the design
   of the methodology, and discuss delimitation problems and how to
   develop suitable classifications of project funding instruments, as
   well as data availability and limitations. We present examples of our
   quantitative results for six European countries and of the questions
   they raise for comparative policy analysis.

AB Introduction A variety of different treatment options are available for
   displaced three- or four-part fractures. In a retrospective cohort
   study we evaluated the results of intramedullary nailing with the ACE
   nail and conservative treatment of displaced proximal humeral fractures.
   Materials and methods Twenty-four patients suffered a neer 4, 5 or 6
   proximal humeral fracture who were treated with intramedullary nailing.
   Sixteen patients received conservative treatment for their Neer 4, 5 or
   6 fracture.
   Results Taking critical remarks in consideration, the results of
   intramedullary nailing are not very satisfactory compared to the
   conservative-treated group. However functional results of our operative
   group are comparable to those from other studies in literature.
   Conclusion Displaced three- or four-part proximal humeral fractures can
   be treated by intramedullary nailing. Familiarity with the fracture
   deformity and experience with the surgical techniques are critical for
   successful operative treatment outcome. Most complications in the
   operative treatment group can be avoided; inadequate reduction can lead
   to wrong insertion place with secondary problems (dislocation and
   subacromial impingement). Also future improvements in osteosynthesis
   like angle stable screw fixation (osteoporosis) and minimally invasive
   device will probably decrease the complication rate.

AB The new CoaguChek XS system is designed for use in patient
   self-testing. It is the successor of the current CoaguChek S system.
   The detection principle is based on the amperometric measurement of the
   thrombin activity initiated by starting the coagulation cascade using a
   human recombinant thromboplastin. This study was performed to assign
   the International SEnsitivity Index (ISI) to the new test according to
   the WHO guidelines for thromboplastins and plasmas used to control
   anticoagulant therapy, and to establish the measuring range of the new
   system. At four study sites a total of 90 samples of normal donors and
   291 samples of warfarin-, phenprocoumon- or acenocoumarol-treated
   patients were included in the study.The ISI value of the new test was
   assigned against the human recombinant reference thromboplastin rTF/95
   at each site using the samples from stabilized patients in the
   International Normalized Ratio (INR) range between 1.5 and 4.5 only.
   The new point-of-care system's measuring range between 0.8 and 8 INR
   was calibrated against the mean INR of rTF/95 and AD 149 using
   polynomial regression. ISIs were (CV of the slope): Site 1: ISI 0.99
   (1.1 %); Site 2: ISI 1.02 (2.0%); Site 3: ISI 1.03 (1.1 %); Site 4: ISI
   1.00 (1.4%). All regression lines calculated from patient-only data
   pass through the normal donor data points.All CVs of the slopes of the
   orthogonal regression lines are well below 3%, thus fulfilling the
   requirements of the WHO guidelines. The mean ISI for the new CoaguChek
   XS PT Test is 1.01.

AB Context. Close white dwarf - red dwarf binaries must have gone through
   a common-envelope phase during their evolution. DE CVn is a detached
   white dwarf - red dwarf binary with a relatively short (similar to 8.7
   h) orbital period. Its brightness and the presence of eclipses makes
   this system ideal for a more detailed study.
   Aims. From a study of photometric* and spectroscopic observations of DE
   CVn we derive the system parameters that we discuss in the framework of
   common-envelope evolution.
   Methods. Photometric observations of the eclipses are used to determine
   an accurate ephemeris. From a model fit to an average low-resolution
   spectrum of DE CVn, we constrain the temperature of the white dwarf and
   the spectral type of the red dwarf. The eclipse light curve is analysed
   and combined with the radial velocity curve of the red dwarf determined
   from time-resolved spectroscopy to derive constraints on the
   inclination and the masses of the components in the system.
   Results. The derived ephemeris is HJD(min) = 2 452 784.5533( 1) +
   0.3641394( 2) x E. The red dwarf in DE CVn has a spectral type of M3V
   and the white dwarf has an effective temperature of 8 000 K. The
   inclination of the system is 86(-2)(+3o) and the mass and radius of the
   red dwarf are 0.41 +/- 0.06 M-circle dot and 0.37(-0.007)(+0.06) R-.,
   respectively, and the mass and radius of the white dwarf are
   0.51(-0.02)(+0.06) M-circle dot and 0.0136(-0.0002)(+0.0008) R-circle
   dot, respectively.
   Conclusions. We found that the white dwarf has a hydrogen-rich
   atmosphere (DA-type). Given that DE CVn has experienced a
   common-envelope phase, we can reconstruct its evolution and we find
   that the progenitor of the white dwarf was a relatively low-mass star
   (M <= 1.6 M-circle dot). The current age of this system is 3.3- 7.3 x
   10(9) years, while it will take longer than the Hubble time for DE CVn
   to evolve into a semi-detached system.

AB Three brands of blood collection tubes were studied for their influence
   on the prothrombin time (PT) and international sensitivity index
   (ISI)for 5 commercial thromboplastin reagents. With all reagents, PTs
   were shorter in Vacutainer (Becton Dickinson Vacutainer Systems,
   Plymouth, England) samples than in S-Monovette (Sarstedt, Numbrecht,
   Germany) or Venosafe (Terumo Europe, Leuven, Belgium) samples. ISI
   values were higher with Vacutainer samples than with S-Monovette or
   Venosafe samples. The ISI differences between the tubes were small for
   Thromborel-S (2.1%; Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) and Hepato Quick
   (1.1%; Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France; Roche Diagnostics
   Nederland, Almere, the Netherlands) but greater for Neoplastin Plus
   (5.5%; Diagnostica Stago; Roche Diagnostics Nederland), Simplastin HTF
   (8.3%; bioMerieux, Durham, NC), and Innovin (8.8%; Dade Behring). The
   PT and ISI differences between the tubes could be explained mostly by
   the effect of magnesium ion contamination in the sodium citrate
   solutions. When PT ratios were transformed into international
   normalized ratios (INRs) using crossover ISI (ie, samples collected
   with one type of tube and ISI determined with another collection system
   for the PT reagent), the differences in mean INRs could be
   approximately 10%. For ISI calibration of reference thromboplastins,
   blood collection tubes should be used with minimal divalent metal ion
   contamination of the citrate solution.

AB Background: It is no longer feasible to check local International
   Normalized Ratios (INR) by the World Health Organization International
   Sensitivity Index (ISI) calibrations because the necessary manual
   prothrombin time technique required has generally been discarded.
   Objectives: An international collaborative study at 77 centers has
   compared local INR correction using the two alternative methods
   recommended in the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the
   International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis guidelines: local
   ISI calibration and 'Direct INR'. Methods: Success of INR correction by
   local ISI calibration and with Direct INR was assessed with a set of 27
   certified lyophilized plasmas (20 from patients on warfarin and seven
   from normals). Results: At 49 centers using human thromboplastins, 3.0%
   initial average local INR deviation from certified INR was reduced by
   local ISI calibration to 0.7%, and at 25 centers using rabbit reagents,
   from 15.9% to 7.5%. With a minority of commercial thromboplastins,
   mainly 'combined' rabbit reagents, INR correction was not achieved by
   local ISI calibration. However, when rabbit combined reagents were
   excluded the overall mean INR deviation after correction was reduced
   further to 3.9%. In contrast, with Direct INR, mean deviation using
   human thromboplastins increased from 3.0% to 6.6%, but there was some
   reduction with rabbit reagents from 15.9% to 10% (12.3% with combined
   reagents excluded). Conclusions: Local ISI calibration gave INR
   correction for the majority of PT systems but failed at the small
   number using combined rabbit reagents suggesting a need for a combined
   reference thromboplastin. Direct INR correction was disappointing but
   better than local ISI calibration with combined rabbit reagents.
   Interlaboratory variability was improved by both procedures with human
   reagents only.

ID SPACED DATA; STARS; FIELD; SEARCH; COLOR; DWARF
AB We present the V-band variability analysis of the point sources in the
   Faint Sky Variability Survey on time-scales from 24 min to tens of
   days. We find that about one per cent of the point sources down to V =
   24 are variables. We discuss the variability-detection probabilities
   for each field depending on field sampling, amplitude and time-scale of
   the variability. The combination of colour and variability information
   allows us to explore the fraction of variable sources for different
   spectral types. We find that about 50 per cent of the variables show
   variability time-scales shorter than 6 h. The total number of variables
   is dominated by main-sequence sources. The distribution of variables
   with spectral type is fairly constant along the main sequence, with I
   per cent of the sources being variable, except at the blue end of the
   main sequence, between spectral types F0 and F5, where the fraction of
   variable sources increases to about 2 per cent. For bluer sources,
   above the main sequence, this percentage increases to about 3.5. We
   find that the combination of the sampling and the number of
   observations allows us to determine the variability time-scales and
   amplitudes for a maximum of 40 per cent of the variables found. About a
   third of the total number of short time-scale variables found in the
   survey were not detected in either B or/and I band. These show a
   similar variability time-scale distribution to that found for the
   variables detected in all three bands.

AB A system for quality assessment (QA) of the CoaguChek (Roche
   Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) point-of-care testing prothrombin time
   monitor has been developed by the European Concerted Action on
   Anticoagulation. Hitherto there has not been an adequate rapid method
   for CoaguChek QA.
   Sets of 5 certified international normalized ratio (INR) plasma samples
   were tested on 539 CoaguChek monitors by experienced staff at 9
   Netherlands Thrombosis Centers and results compared with certified INR.
   A 15% or more deviation has been classified as significant deviation.
   Overall mean and certified INR values were similar, but 20.3% of
   participants showed a 15% or more deviation from the certified INR on
   at least I of the 5 QA plasma samples. Statistically significant
   differences in results with different lots of CoaguChek test strips
   were found. There is need for large scale QA of CoaguChek monitors. The
   importance of the 5 CoaguChek certified INR QA plasma samples being
   tested on a single occasion is demonstrated.

AB Background: There is a need for dependable quality assessment (QA) of
   the widely used CoaguChek point-of-care testing prothrombin time
   monitor. By use of the prescribed set of 5 CoaguChek certified
   international normalized ratio (INR) QA plasmas, we compared the
   reliability of the immediate QA of individual monitors described in the
   European Community-recommended Technology Implementation Plan with
   conventional external QA analysis.
   Methods: Experienced staff tested CoaguChek point-of-care monitors in
   routine use for controlling oral anticoagulant dosage at 9 Netherlands
   Thrombosis Service Centres. Testing was performed with both the
   certified CoaguChek INR for a set of 5 QA individual plasmas from the
   Eur Con Action on Anticoag (ECAA) and conventional external QA analysis.
   Results: Patients brought 523 CoaguChek monitors to our service centers
   for assessment. The proportion with unsatisfactory performance
   indicated by a 15% deviation from the ECAA set was compared with 15%
   deviation from overall median INR of all CoaguChek monitors in the
   survey, as in conventional QA analysis. The results were similar (20.3%
   and 18.5%, respectively). Interlot differences of CoaguChek test strips
   were detected, but the incidence of unsatisfactory performance was
   similar with both analyses, from 6.5% to 37.5% with the certified INR
   method and from 5.9% to 33.3% with the overall median analysis.
   Conclusions: The results validate the use of the European Action on
   Anticoagulation rapid single-instrument QA-specific procedure for
   CoaguChek users compared with the nonspecific conventional QA analysis
   that relies on deviation from the overall median INR. (c) 2006 American

AB Reference materials for thromboplastins are available from the World
   Health Organization (WHO) and the European Commission (EC). The
   long-term stability of the reference materials is an essential
   requirement and must be monitored. The relationship between two
   reference materials for rabbit thromboplastin, i.e. ERM-AD 149 (EC) and
   RBT/90 (WHO), has been monitored in the period 1996-2002. No
   significant trend with time was detected. In addition, the relationship
   between ERM-AD 149 and the reference material for bovine thromboplastin
   (i.e. OBT/79) has been determined in 1994 and in 2005 in multi-centre
   studies (n = 11 and n = 9, respectively). No significant changes were
   observed in the relationships between these reference materials when
   all results were included (5% significance level).

DT Proceedings Paper
ID COMBINED COCITATION; SCIENCE
AB Mapping of science and technology can be done at different levels of
   aggregation, using a variety of methods. In this paper, we propose a
   method in which title words are used as indicators for the content of a
   research topic, and cited references are used as the context in which
   words get their meaning. Research topics are represented by sets of
   papers that are similar in terms of these word-reference combinations.
   In this way we use words without neglecting differences and changes in
   their meanings. The method has several advantages, such as high
   coverage of publications. As an illustration we apply the method to
   produce knowledge maps of information science.

AB Background: A preparation of rabbit brain thromboplastin, provisionally
   coded 04/162, is proposed as a candidate for the World Health
   Organization (WHO) International Standard (IS) for thromboplastin
   (rabbit, plain), meant to replace the IS coded RBT/90 (rabbit, plain),
   stocks of which are now exhausted. Results: The preparation was
   calibrated in an international collaborative study involving 21
   laboratories from 13 countries and the calibration was performed
   against the existing WHO-IS (i.e. rTF/95 and OBT/79) and other
   Certified Reference Materials from the Institute for Reference
   Materials and Measurements of the European Commission (i.e. CRM149 S)
   and from the European Action on Anticoagulation (i.e. EUTHR-01). An
   additional candidate rabbit brain thromboplastin coded as 04/106 was
   also included in the study. On the basis of predefined criteria (the
   within- and between-laboratory precision of the calibration and the
   conformity to the calibration model), 04/162 was the preferred
   candidate. Conclusions: The assigned International Sensitivity Index
   value was 1.15 and the inter-laboratory SD and coefficient of variation
   were 0.057% and 4.9%, respectively.

AB We present time-resolved spectroscopy and photometry of the cataclysmic
   variable (CV) SDSS J133941.11+484727.5 (SDSS 1339) which has been
   discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4. The
   orbital period determined from radial velocity studies is 82.524(24)
   min, close to the observed period minimum. The optical spectrum of SDSS
   1339 is dominated to 90 per cent by emission from the white dwarf (WD).
   The spectrum can be successfully reproduced by a three-component model
   (white dwarf, disc, secondary) with T-WD=12 500 K for a fixed log g=
   8.0, d= 170 pc, and a spectral type of the secondary later than M8. The
   mass-transfer rate corresponding to the optical luminosity of the
   accretion disc is very low, similar or equal to 1.7 x 10(-13) M-circle
   dot yr(-1). Optical photometry reveals a coherent variability at 641 s
   with an amplitude of 0.025 mag, which we interpret as non-radial
   pulsations of the white dwarf. In addition, a long-period photometric
   variation with a period of either 320 or 344 min and an amplitude of
   0.025 mag is detected, which bears no apparent relation with the
   orbital period of the system. Similar long-period photometric signals
   have been found in the CVs SDSS J123813.73-033933.0, SDSS
   J204817.85-061044.8, GW Lib and FS Aur, but so far no working model for
   this behaviour is available.

DE factor VIII : C assay; calibration; commutability; harmonisation;

ID EXTERNAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT; COMMUTABILITY
AB In a Dutch project for harmonisation of factor VIII coagulant activity
   (FVIII:Q assays, the commutability of potential calibrators for FVIII:C
   was assessed by means of a 'twin-study design', which is in essence a
   multi-centre, split-patient sample, between-field-methods protocol.
   Commutability was defined as the degree to which a material yielded the
   same numerical relationships between results of measurements by a given
   set of measurement procedures as those between the expectations of the
   relationships for the same procedures applied to those types of
   material for which the procedures were intended. The study consisted of
   the simultaneous analysis of fresh frozen patient plasmas and three
   potential calibrators for FVIII:C by 16 Dutch laboratories forming
   eight couples. The state-of-the-art intralaboratory standard deviation
   was used to assess the commutability of the potential calibrators. One
   potential calibrator was used to harmonise FVIII:C assay results in a
   Dutch field study. The inter-laboratory coefficient of variation of two
   test samples could be reduced significantly, but no significant effect
   was observed with three other test samples. We recommend that at least
   three different sample dilutions be used in each FVIII:C assay, in
   agreement with previous recommendations.

AB Whole-blood point-of-care testing prothrombin time monitors are being
   used on an increasing scale for the monitoring of oral anticoagulant
   therapy. These monitors are used with disposable test strips containing
   tissue factor reagent. The purpose of the present study was to assess
   the stability of different Coagu-Chek-S strip lots for a period of one
   year. Ten strip lots introduced successively in the Netherlands were
   obtained from the manufacturer's representative and stored at 4-8
   degrees C. Six deep-frozen pooled plasmas were analyzed for the
   prothrombin time and INR with the strips at six or seven occasions
   spread over one year. The test plasmas were recalcified immediately
   before application to the CoaguChek-S system. Regression analysis was
   performed on the clotting times obtained with each plasma. In the
   majority of cases (i.e. 95%), no significant change was observed at the
   5% significance level. A significant change was observed in only 3
   cases. In addition, a ranking statistic was used as test of a monotonic
   relationship in the two-way analysis of variance. The results of the
   ranking statistic were not significant for any strip lot, indicating
   that the test strips were stable under these storage conditions.The
   reproducibility of INR measured with the CoaguChek-S was assessed. The
   mean within-run coefficient of variation (CV) of INR ranged from 2.58%
   to 3.36% (CV).The between-lot variation of the mean INR ranged from 3.2
   to 4.5 % (CV).The over-all variation of single INR measurements, i.e.
   including between-lot and within-lot, ranged from 5.0 to 6.0 % (CV).

ID PROTHROMBIN TIME; FRESH PLASMA; PLAIN
AB A 10 centre calibration was performed after six years to determine the
   international sensitivity index (ISI) of rTF/95 relative to RBT/90, and
   to assess any international normalised ratio (INR) bias compared with
   the original multicentre calibration. After exclusion of one outlying
   centre, the follow up calibration gave a mean ISI for rTF/95 of 0.99,
   which although a small difference, is significantly greater than the
   mean ISI of 0.94 obtained previously. The change in ISI for
   international reference preparation (IRP) rTF/95 relative to RBT/90
   would lead to a slight bias in INR for human compared with rabbit
   thromboplastins. At a theoretical INR of 3.0, the INR bias is 6.0%, and
   this is below the accepted 10% level of clinical relevance. Ongoing
   stability monitoring of World Health Organisation thromboplastin IRP is
   advised.

   affected the urban economy, the global urban networks, various
   dimensions of urban life, and social divides within cities. In this
   introduction we discuss some of the effects of ICTs on the city, to put
   Digital Cities experiments into social context. Next, we describe the
   diversity of existing local ICT infrastructures, followed by a summary
   of this volume. The 26 chapters give a broad overview of some ten years
   of experimenting with and research on digital cities. We conclude with
   a few observations about the research field.

AB We present the identification of 13 DB + dM binaries and 2 DC + dM
   binaries from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Before the SDSS only
   2 DB + dM binaries and 1 DC + dM binary were known. At least three,
   possibly 8, of the new DB + dM binaries seem to have white dwarf
   temperatures well above 30 000 K which would place them in the so
   called DB-gap. Finding these DB white dwarfs in binaries may suggest
   that they have formed through a different evolutionary channel than the
   ones in which DA white dwarfs transform into DB white dwarfs due to
   convection in the upper layers.

AB Background: The quality of oral anticoagulant therapy management with
   coumarin derivatives requires reliable results for the prothrombin
   time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR). We assessed the effect on
   PT/INR of preanalytical variables, including ones related to off-site
   blood collection and transportation to a laboratory.
   Methods: Four laboratories with different combinations of blood
   collection systems, thromboplastin reagents, and coagulation meters
   participated. The simulated preanalytical variables included time
   between blood collection and PT/INR determinations on samples stored at
   room temperature, at 4-6 degreesC, and at 37 degreesC; mechanical
   agitation at room temperature, at 4-6 degreesC, and at 37 degreesC time
   between centrifugation and PTANR determination; and times and
   temperatures of centrifugation. For variables that affected results,
   the effect of the variable was classified as moderate when <25% of
   samples showed a change >10% or as large if >25% of samples showed such
   a change.
   Results: During the first 6 h after blood collection, INR changed by
   >10% in <25% of samples (moderate effect) when blood samples were
   stored at room temperature, 4-6 &DEG;C, or 37 &DEG;C with or without
   mechanical agitation and independent of the time of centrifugation
   after blood collection. With one combination of materials and
   preartalytical conditions, a 24-h delay at room temperature or 4-6
   &DEG;C had a large effect, i.e., changes >10% in >25% of samples. In
   all laboratories, a 24-h delay at 37 degreesC or with mechanical
   agitation had a large effect. We observed no clinically or
   statistically relevant INR differences among studied centrifugation
   conditions (centrifugation temperature, 20 degreesC or no temperature
   control; centrifugation time, 5 or 10 min).
   Conclusions: We recommend a maximum of 6 h between blood collection and
   PT/INR determination. The impact of a 24-h delay should be investigated
   for each combination of materials and conditions. (C) 2005 American

AB The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of two types
   of evacuated blood collection tube on the prothrombin time and
   international sensitivity index (ISI) of Recombiplastin, a recombinant
   human thromboplastin. Vacutainer tubes were compared with Venoject II
   tubes. Magnesium contamination was detected in the sodium citrate
   solutions contained in the Vacutainer tubes with concentrations ranging
   from 1.1 to 1.5 mmol/l. In contrast, magnesium ions could not be
   detected in the Venoject II tubes. The prothrombin ratio was decreased
   by contamination with magnesium ions and, hence, the ISI was increased.
   The magnitude of the effect of magnesium contamination on the ISI was
   influenced by the type of coagulometer and increased in the order: ACL
   Advance (3%), ACL-300 (4%), Electra-1000 (6%). The ISI bias is
   transmitted to the international normalized ratio (INR). In the case of
   the Electra-1000, the INR bias would be approximately 6% at INR 3.0 if
   the two types of blood collection tubes would be used without
   distinction. In a secondary study, the effect of magnesium
   contamination on the prothrombin time was assessed with the current
   World Health Organization international reference preparation for
   recombinant human thromboplastin (rTF/95). Magnesium chloride added to
   patients' blood (0.2 mmol/l) induced 2.3% reduction of the INR
   determined with rTF/95 and the manual technique. Conclusion: The
   magnitude of the influence of blood collection tubes contaminated with
   magnesium on ISI and INR determined with recombinant human
   thromboplastin depends on the coagulometer. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Reliable international normalized ratio (INR) determination depends on
   accurate values for international sensitivity index (ISI) and mean
   normal prothrombin time (MNPT). Local ISI calibration can be performed
   to obtain reliable INR. Alternatively, the laboratory may determine INR
   directly from a line relating local log(prothrombin time [PT]) to
   log(INR). This can be done by means of lyophilized or frozen plasmas to
   which certified values of PT or INR have been assigned. Currently there
   is one procedure for local calibration with certified plasmas which is
   a modification of the WHO method of ISI determination. In the other
   procedure, named 'direct' INR determination, certified plasmas are used
   to calculate a line relating log(PT) to log(INR). The number of
   certified plasmas for each procedure depends on the method of
   preparation and type of plasma. Lyophilization of plasma may induce
   variable effects on the INR, the magnitude of which depends on the type
   of thromboplastin used. Consequently, the manufacturer or supplier of
   certified plasmas must assign the values for different (reference)
   thromboplastins and validate the procedure for reliable ISI calibration
   or 'direct' INR determination. Certification of plasmas should be
   performed by at least three laboratories. Multiple values should be
   assigned if the differences between thromboplastin systems are greater
   than 10%. Testing of certified plasmas for ISI calibration may be
   performed in quadruplicate in the same working session. It is
   recommended to repeat the measurements on three sessions or days to
   control day-to-day variation. Testing of certified plasmas for 'direct'
   INR determination should be performed in at least three sessions or
   days. Correlation lines for ISI calibration and for 'direct' INR
   determination should be calculated by means of orthogonal regression.
   Quality assessment of the INR with certified plasmas should be
   performed regularly and should be repeated whenever there is a change
   in reagent batch or in instrument. Discrepant results obtained by users
   of certified plasmas should be reported to manufacturers or suppliers.

AB In many places e-voting technologies are under development, and an
   intensive theoretical and normative debate is taking place about the
   pros and cons. We investigate the opinions of the users of this type of
   technologies, as this is crucial for the shaping and acceptance of the
   technology. We did not use a survey, but held 14 intensive discussion
   sessions in different countries with voters and organisers of ballots,
   using the focus groups methodology. We found consensus that e-voting
   will not influence turnout. The motivation to start with e-voting
   therefore seems mainly financial, aiming at reducing costs. This
   suggests that in the future e-voting will replace traditional ways of
   voting, and therefore the digital divide can be expected to influence
   the participation in and the outcome of ballots. Finally, although most
   respondents expect that e-voting may improve (especially local)
   democracy through a combination of voting technologies with
   technologies for supporting deliberation and information dissemination,
   it remains unclear how this should be done. More detailed studies into
   political participation and the subtle roles of ICT's herein are
   needed, as this can inform the design of adequate technologies for
   e-democracy.

AB The international sensitivity index (ISI) of the first working standard
   of Simplastin HTF, a new human tissue factor thromboplastin derived
   from cultured human cells, has been assessed in a calibration exercise
   in two Canadian and five European laboratories. Calibrations against
   international reference preparations (IRP) were performed for the
   manual method and six types of automated coagulometers that cover the
   majority of clotting endpoint principles in routine use. The ISI was
   method-dependent and varied between 1.03 and 1.29 when calibrated
   against rTF/95 (human IRP). The ISI was also dependent on the route of
   calibration. Compared with calibration against rTF/95, the ISIs
   obtained by calibration against RBT/90 (rabbit IRP) were on average
   4.4% higher (P < 0.005). Considering the principle of 'like vs. like',
   the ISIs obtained by calibration against rTF/95 should be preferred.

AB Background: International Normalized Ratios (INRs) for prothrombin time
   obtained with the CoaguChek Mini and TAS (RapidPointCoag) PT-NC systems
   are markedly different and also differ from the "true" INR. There is
   therefore a need for local quality assessment (QA) of the two systems.
   Methods: A set of 60 lyophilized artificially depleted and 60
   lyophilized coumarin plasmas were tested at 10 centers on both
   point-of-care testing monitors. Subsets of three and five plasmas were
   selected as QA plasmas and compared with the remaining 55 to assess the
   relative ability of the systems to characterize performance at the
   individual centers. The incidence of aberrant results (outliers; >15%
   deviation from the true INR) was also recorded. The expected incidence
   with the QA plasmas was calculated and compared.
   Results: On both systems, INR with the common sets of 55 lyophilized
   plasmas varied considerably between centers. With the TAS PT-NC,
   subsets of five and three European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation
   (ECAA) artificially depleted plasmas gave good correlation with the 55
   plasmas, but the coumarin plasmas performed less well. With the
   CoaguChek Mini, correlation was good with sets of five artificially
   depleted QA plasmas and reasonable with three but was less satisfactory
   with the coumarin plasmas. Outliers were detected with both types of
   plasmas on both test systems but with variable success.
   Conclusions: With the TAS PT-NC, three ECAA artificially depleted
   lyophilized plasmas provided reliable QA, but five lyophilized coumarin
   plasmas were required. With the CoaguChek Mini, five artificially
   depleted plasmas gave reliable QA but coumarin plasmas gave poorer
   results. ECAA QA plasmas provide a local system for checking INRs
   obtained with monitors of both types. (C) 2004 American Association for

   observed by RGS and EPIC-MOS on board XMM-Newton and by LETGS on board
   Chandra. From the lightcurve the presence of flaring states and a
   quiescent part is noticed. Temperatures up to 20 MK have been
   determined. A significant increase of the emission measure (EM) at high
   temperatures is determined for the flaring state. An indication for an
   Inverse First Ionization Potential (IFIP) effect has been found. (C)

ID PROTHROMBIN TIME; ENHANCED STANDARDIZATION; SENSITIVITY INDEX; INR;
   MULTICENTER
AB Background: For monitoring of treatment with oral anticoagulants; the
   clotting time obtained in the prothrombin time (PT) test is transformed
   to the International Normalized Ratio (INR) with use of a
   system-specific International Sensitivity Index (ISI). The calibrant
   plasma-procedure (CPP) is an alternative approach to INR calculation
   based on the use of a set of lyophilized plasmas with assigned INRs.
   Methods: With the CPP, a linear relationship is established between
   log(PT) and log(INR), using orthogonal regression. CPP was validated
   for Simplastin HTF, a new human tissue factor reagent derived,from
   cultured human cells: CPP precision was assessed as the CV-of the slope
   of the regression line: The accuracy of the CPP was determined, by
   comparing the INR obtained with the CPP with that obtained with the
   established ISI-based deference method. INRs of the calibrants were
   assigned by different routes: by manufacturer (consen- sus labeling) or
   by use of Simplastin HTF or International Reference Preparations (IRPs;
   rTF/95 or RBT/90).
   Results: The. mean CV of the CPP regression slope ranged from 1.0%
   (Simplastin HTF reagent-specific INR) to 2.4% (INR assigned with
   rTF/95). INRs calculated with the CPP were similar to those obtained
   with the reference method, but when the routes for assigning INRs to
   the calibrant plasmas were compared, the mean difference in INR between
   CPP and the reference method was smaller with Simplastin HTF
   reagent-specific values. In several (but not all) cases, this
   difference was significant, (P < 0.05, t-test).
   Conclusion: CPP can be used for local INR determination, but better
   precision and accuracy are obtained with reagent-specific INRs compared
   with INR assignment by consensus labeling or IRP. (C) 2003 American

AB Background: Several studies have demonstrated that patient
   self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) can improve
   treatment quality. However, most of these studies were not conducted
   within a specialized anticoagulation care system. The objective of the
   present study was to determine whether patient self-management of OAT
   improves the quality of care delivered by anticoagulation clinics.
   Methods: In this randomized study by 2 Dutch anticoagulation clinics
   341 patients aged between 18 and 75 years and receiving long-term OAT
   were divided into 4 groups: an existing routine care group of patients
   untrained in self-management; a routine care group of trained patients;
   a group managed weekly at an anticoagulation clinic where international
   normalized ratios were measured by trained patients; and weekly patient
   self-management. A 2-step randomization procedure was followed: first,
   a Zelen-design randomization was performed to distribute patients
   (without informing them) to the existing care group or to receive
   training in self-management; second, trained patients were randomized
   to the 3 other study groups.
   Results: Only 25.6% of invited patients agreed to participate in the
   training program. Patients who remained in the existing care group were
   within the international normalized ratio target range 63.5% of the
   time. The type of coumarin taken was a major predicting factor of OAT
   quality. In all study groups phenprocoumon outperformed acenocournarol
   by 11.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6%-16.5%). Weekly management
   with phenprocournon led to a 6.5% improvement (95% CI, 0.0%-13.1%) in
   time in the international normalized ratio target range when patients
   were managed at an anticoagulation clinic and to an 8.7% improvement
   (95% Cl, 1.6%-15.9%) when patients were self-managed. Weekly management
   with acenocoumarol did not improve the quality of OAT.
   Conclusion: With selected patients, the quality of OAT obtained through
   patient self-management is at least as high as that delivered by
   specialized physicians at anticoagulation clinics. Weekly management of
   OAT with long-acting phenprocournon has to be preferred at
   anticoagulation clinics or, where possible, through patient
   self-management.

AB The M-dwarf AD Leonis has been observed with the Reflection Grating
   Spectrometers and the European Photon Imaging Camera aboard XMM-Newton
   and also with the Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer aboard
   the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In the observation taken with XMM-Newton
   five large flares produced by AD Leo were identified and only one in
   the observation taken with Chandra. A quiescent level to the
   lightcurves is difficult to define, since several smaller flares
   mutually overlap each other. However, we defined a quasi-steady state
   outside of obvious flares or flare decays. The spectra from the flare
   state and the quasi-steady state are analysed separately. From these
   spectra the temperature structure was derived with a multi-temperature
   model and with a differential emission measure model. The
   multi-temperature model was also used to determine the relative
   abundances of C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe. He-like ions, such as O
   VII and Ne IX, produce line triplets which are used to determine or
   constrain the electron temperature and electron density of the
   corresponding ion. During the flare state a higher emission measure at
   the hottest temperature is found for both XMM-Newton and Chandra
   observations. The derived abundances suggest the presence of an inverse
   First Ionization Potential effect in the corona of AD Leo.

   journals, the communication network based on project collaborations,
   and finally the communication of information over the 'virtual' network
   of web links. The approach is applied on typical 'Mode 2' fields such
   as biotechnology, while using a variety of data sources. We present
   some of the initial findings, which indicate the different structures
   and functions of the three layers of communication.

AB The international normalized ratio (INR) on two widely used
   point-of-care test (POCT) prothrombin time ( PT) monitors (CoaguChek
   Mini and TAS PT-NC) differed considerably and also differed from the
   'true' INR obtained on the same samples using a manual PT and the same
   species thromboplastin international reference preparation. Agreement
   between the displayed INR and difference from 'true' INR has been
   reassessed following an independent international sensitivity index
   (ISI) calibration of the two systems. The displayed INRs taken at seven
   centres were compared with 'true' INRs from the same blood donations
   and INRs based on the resulting ISI. The overall difference between the
   displayed INRs on the two monitor systems was reduced from 21.0% to
   3.5%. The overall difference in mean INR of system A from the 'true'
   INR was reduced from 19.0% to 9.5% and of system B from 6.8% to 0.3%,
   but individual centre's results still showed considerable mean INR
   variability. Differences between overall displayed INR with the two
   monitor systems have been reduced by an independent multicentre
   calibration, and agreement with 'true' INR on the same blood samples
   improved. However, marked variability in mean INR at individual centres
   remained after ISI correction, which demonstrates the need for external
   quality control of individual POCT whole-blood PT monitors.

   international normalised ratios (INRs).
   Design Comparison of the INRs from the two systems with a "true" INR on
   a conventional manual test from the same sample of blood.
   Setting 10 European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation centres.
   Participants 600 patients on long term dosage of warfarin.
   Main outcome measures Comparable results between the different methods.
   Results The mean displayed INR differed by 21.3% between the two point
   of care test monitoring systems. The INR on one system was 15.2%
   higher, on average, than the true INR, but on the other system the INR
   was 7.1% lower. The percentage difference between the mean displayed
   INR and the true INR at individual centres varied considerably with
   both systems.
   Conclusions Improved international sensitivity index calibration of
   point of care test monitors by their manufacturers is needed, and
   better methods of quality control of individual instruments by their
   users are also needed.

AB Previously, the attempt to simplify the International Sensitivity Index
   (ISI) calibration of the CoaguChek Mini whole blood point-of-care test
   prothrombin time (PT) monitor system was successful using lyophilized
   plasmas from coumarin-treated patients but not with lyophilized
   artificially depleted plasmas. With the TAS PT-NC monitor system, both
   types of plasma failed to provide reliable calibrations. The present
   study assesses a procedure for the ISI calibration of a TAS PT-NC and
   CoaguChek Mini whole blood point-of-care test PT monitor systems using
   lyophilized plasmas. Using lyophilized artificially depleted and
   coumarin plasma calibrations, we have evaluated a correction for the
   monitor displayed PT. This was based on a 'line of equivalence' derived
   from the relationship between whole blood and fresh plasma PT with both
   types of monitor system. With the TAS PT-NC, the use of this 'line of
   equivalence' resulted in reliable ISI with both lyophilized coumarin
   and artificially depleted plasmas. There was no significant difference
   between mean monitor and mean reference International Normalized Ratio
   (INR) with the artificially depleted plasmas. With the lyophilized
   coumarin plasma calibrations there was only a small INR difference.
   Correction with the 'line of equivalence' therefore facilitates
   calibration of the TAS PT-NC with lyophilized plasmas. With the
   CoaguChek Mini, the correction based on the 'line of equivalence' did
   not improve results but was not required with this system.

AB International sensitivity index (ISI) calibration of whole blood
   prothrombin time (PT) monitors is too complex. We previously simplified
   the method by using European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation (ECAA)
   lyophilized plasma samples with the TAS PT-NC (Bayer AG, Leverkusen,
   Germany) and the CoaguChek Mini (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)
   whole blood PT monitoring systems. The TAS PT-NC required a correction
   derived from the line of equivalence. Monte Carlo bootstrap analysis of
   reducing numbers of test samples was performed with both systems.
   Plasma samples from patients receiving coumarin (coumarin samples),
   healthy subjects (normal samples), and plasma samples artificially
   depleted of coagulation factors were used. With the TAS PT-NC, 20
   coumarin samples or 20 artificially depleted samples with 7 normal
   samples gave reliable ISI and international normalized ratio and
   satisfactory precision. With the CoaguChek Mini, 30 coumarin and 10
   normal samples were required. Simplification of ISI calibration of the
   2 monitoring systems is possible using fewer ECAA lyophilized plasma
   samples than the 80 required according to the World Health Organization
   guidelines for conventional PT systems and previously recommended for
   fresh plasma samples tested on the same 2 monitoring systems.

AB Magnesium ions can shorten the tissue factor-induced coagulation time.
   Some blood collection systems with sodium citrate are contaminated with
   variable amounts of magnesium and influence the results of the
   prothrombin time (PT) test. The aim of the study was to determine the
   dose-response relationship between exogenous magnesium chloride added
   to blood and the PT and the international normalized ratio (INR). Blood
   specimens from twenty patients on oral anticoagulant therapy were
   investigated. Four different types of thromboplastin reagents were
   used: recombinant human, human placenta, rabbit brain, and bovine brain
   combined with adsorbed bovine plasma. With all four reagents, exogenous
   magnesium induced a reduction of the apparent INR. Bovine
   thromboplastin was not as responsive to magnesium as the human and
   rabbit reagents. The magnitude of the INR deviation induced by 0.1
   mmol/l magnesium in the blood was smaller than 10% in all patient
   samples. At 0.5 mmol/l magnesium in the blood, 10-35% of the patient
   samples had INR deviations greater than 10%, depending on the
   thromboplastin reagent used.

AB Aims: The recommended method for the international sensitivity index
   (ISI) calibration of whole blood point of care testing (POCT)
   prothrombin time (PT) systems was originally described by Tripodi et al
   in 1993 but is too complex and demanding. The present European
   Concerted Action on Anticoagulation (ECAA) study aimed to assess the
   reliability of simpler ISI calibration using lyophilised plasma samples.
   Methods: ISI calibrations using three different types of ECAA
   lyophilised plasma samples (artificially depleted, individual, and
   pooled coumarin) were compared with whole blood calibrations on
   CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC POCT monitors at 10 centres.
   Results: With CoaguChek Mini systems, lyophilised coumarin plasma
   samples (both single donation and pooled) gave ISI and international
   normalised ratio (INR) values comparable to whole blood. With
   artificially depleted plasma, ISI and INR values were too high. With
   TAS PT-NC systems, all three types of lyophilised plasma samples gave
   inaccurate ISI and unreliable INR results, similar to previous ECAA
   findings with fresh plasma calibrations.
   Conclusions: With CoaguChek Mini systems, ISI calibration can be
   simplified by the use of ECAA lyophilised plasma samples from coumarin
   treated patients. Further study is needed to devise a simpler
   calibration method for the TAS PT-NC system.

AB The purpose of the present study was to determine therapeutic ranges
   for unfractionated heparin therapy using the activated partial
   thromboplastin time (APTT) by calibration against anti-Xa
   concentration. APTT assays were performed locally, i.e. at the
   institution of blood collection, on fresh plasma samples from patients
   treated with intravenous unfractionated hepar-in. The measurements were
   performed by 25 Dutch clinical laboratories using 11 different APTT
   reagents and 10 different types of coagulometers. After the local APTT
   measurement, the samples were frozen and transported to a central
   laboratory for measurement of anti-Xa activity. The number of samples
   from the participating laboratories ranged from 10 to 48. Local APTT
   results were correlated with the central anti-Xa measurements.
   Orthogonal regression analysis of log-transformed values was used to
   calculate APTT therapeutic ranges corresponding to anti-Xa
   concentrations of 0.29-0.47 IU/ml. The calculated APTT ranges were
   different between laboratories, even when the same reagent was used. In
   many laboratories, the therapeutic APTT range in use was much wider
   than the calculated range, Imprecision of the calculated APTT range was
   influenced by the wide scatter of the measurement points and by the
   selection of samples for the orthogonal regression equation. The
   present results show that, if anti-Xa concentrations of 0.29-0.47 IU/ml
   reflect the true therapeutic range, many laboratories do not use the
   proper therapeutic APTT range. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

AB The object was to assess the variability in displayed International
   Normalised Ratio (INR) between monitors of the same manufacture using
   whole blood samples from the same subjects. Two brands of monitor,
   CoaguChek Mini and the TAS PT-NC were tested.
   14 instruments of each brand were tested on the same day at the same
   laboratory by the same operator using identical blood samples to avoid
   between-centre differences in samples and operator technique. Whole
   blood samples from two normal donors and four coumarin-treated patients
   were tested to assess between-instrument variability of INR.
   Results have been coded. There was a much wider dispersion of INR on
   Brand B than on Brand A. One Brand A instrument failed to give a result
   with one of the two whole blood samples from one patient. One Brand B
   monitor gave an aberrant result with one of the samples from a normal
   subject.
   On both brands of monitor, INR variability appeared to be due mainly to
   duplication differences rather than between-instrument variability on
   both normal and coumarin whole blood samples.

DT Article
AB In a recent paper in this journal, Loet Leydesdorff and Gaston
   Heimeriks (2001, Journal of the American Society for Information
   Science and Technology, 52, 1262-1294.) argue that biotechnology
   develops in a self-organizational mode, through interaction between the
   intellectual structure and the institutional network of the research
   field. This claim is empirically supported by a multivariate analysis
   of documents from core biotechnology journals. One unexpected finding
   in this paper is the relationship between the title words of documents
   and the region of their origin. This claim requires examination
   because, as will be shown, it seems to be an artifact of the method
   used. If this is so, it undermines the authors' theoretical claim that
   the production of knowledge is a self-organizing process.

AB Introduction: Prothrombin time (PT) test systems require multicentre
   calibration for reliable International Sensitivity Index (ISI).
   Multicentre calibration of CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC point-of-care
   test (POCT) systems is less precise than conventional PT testing. The
   aim of the present study was to determine the number of centres
   required to give reliable ISI and International Normalised Ratio (INR)
   with these two POCT whole blood PT monitors. Materials and methods: A
   simulation study, based on results of a 10-centre calibration exercise,
   was performed to assess reliability of ISI and INR when the number of
   centres was reduced from 10 to 2. Results and Conclusions: With both
   systems, the range of ISI and INR deviation increased as the number of
   centres was reduced. For the CoaguChek Mini, at least,five centres were
   needed for satisfactory INR deviation in 95% of calibrations. With the
   TAS PT NC, three centres gave satisfactory INR at this level. The
   number of centres required for multicentre calibration of these two
   POCT PT systems is greater than the two proposed by World Health
   Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for conventional PT testing. (C) 2002

AB Background. The International Sensitivity Index (ISI) calibration of
   whole-blood prothrombin time (PT) monitors for point-of-care testing
   (POCT) described by Tripodi et al. (Thromb Haemost 1993;70.921-4) has
   been shown to be dependable but is too complex and demanding The use of
   plasma would simplify calibration of whole-blood POCT PT monitors, but
   important differences may exist between the ISI for whole blood and
   plasma calibrations.
   Methods: In a 10-center calibration study of two POCT whole-blood
   monitoring systems (CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC), we characterized the
   relationship between the log PT for whole blood and fresh plasma with
   use of single lots of test strips/cards. This relationship (linear) was
   used to correct the difference between the whole-blood and plasma ISI.
   The reliability of the correction with different lots of test
   strips/cards was assessed at three centers. The linear relationship was
   used to correct the difference in the whole-blood and plasma ISI with
   four other lots of TAS PT-NC cards and with two additional lots of
   CoaguChek Mini test strips.
   Results. The correction decreased the ISI difference from 13.3% to 0.9%
   for the TAS PT-NC and from 5.7% to 0.6% for the CoaguChek Mini. In
   assessments at three centers, which included different lots of test
   strips/cards, the mean ISI difference was markedly decreased with the
   TAS PT-NC but not with the CoaguChek Mini, for which the mean ISI
   difference increased slightly.
   Conclusions: The proposed correction resolves the discrepancy between
   whole-blood and fresh plasma ISI calibrations with TAS PT-NC test
   cards. The CoaguChek Mini systems could be calibrated without this
   correction. (C) 2002 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB Two established international reference preparations (IRP) for

   human, plain) have been calibrated against each other in a 7-centre
   exercise performed in 2000. The purpose of the study was to compare the
   calibration results with those of the original calibration study
   performed in 1995. The international sensitivity index (ISI) for rTF/95
   was calculated relative to the ISI for RBT/90. The mean ISI for rTF/95
   was 0,961 (between-lab SD 0.028) which was 2% greater than the
   historical value determined in 1995. There is no indication that the
   two IRP have deteriorated, but further monitoring of the calibration
   relationship is recommended.

AB The international sensitivity index (ISI) calibration of
   point-of-care-test (POCT) prothrombin time (PT) whole blood monitors is
   complex, requiring manual PT testing of 60 patients' and 20 healthy
   subjects' plasma samples. The possibility of reducing these numbers was
   studied by, a Monte Carlo Bootstrap study for 2 POCT PT systems. For
   reduced sample numbers, this consisted of 50, 000 calibrations using
   whole blood and plasma samples tested on the monitors with manual PT
   testing of plasma samples from the same blood donations. There was
   little effect on mean ISI by reduction of sample numbers to a total of
   7, but there was progressively less certainty, regarding the
   reliability of the calibration. Precision of the calibrations and.
   international normalized ratio deviation were not affected markedly by
   reducing numbers to half As ISI calibration with the 2 POCT systems was
   less precise than conventional manual testing, I for maximum
   confidence, reduction of numbers is not advised.

AB A procedure for using citrated fresh plasmas for International
   Sensitivity Index (ISI) calibration of two types of whole blood
   point-of-care test (POCT) prothrombin time (PT) monitor systems has
   been assessed in a multicentre study.
   The CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC systems gave higher ISI with whole
   blood samples than with fresh plasma calibrations. However, there was
   good agreement between whole blood and fresh plasma monitor system
   International Normalised Ratio (INR) and the reference INR of target
   samples.
   Reliable INR can therefore be obtained with both whole blood and plasma
   samples on these two POCT systems based on their respective ISI. With
   the CoaguChek Mini system. the plasma calibration ISI can also be used
   to derive reliable INR with whole blood PT results. This was not
   possible with the TAS PT-NC system.

AB A multicentre modified World Health Organization (WHO)-type
   international sensitivity index (ISI) calibration has been performed at

   PT-NC, using single lots of test cards/strips. The relevant species
   (human and rabbit) WHO international reference preparations (IRPs) were
   tested with the manual PT technique on citrated plasma from the same
   blood donations. The ISI was calculated from the slope of the
   orthogonal regression line relating log PT (POCT) to log PT (IRP). The
   mean ISI of the CoaguChek Mini system was 1.75 and 1.13 with the
   prothrombin time non-citrated Thrombolytic Assessment System (TAS
   PT-NC). With the CoaguChek Mini system. seven out of 10 calibrations
   exceeded the current 3%, WHO recommended limit for the coefficient of
   variation (CV) of the slope with conventional PT testing, whereas with
   the TAS PT-NO system, it was eight out of 10. All the POCT calibrations
   had a CV of the slope <5%. It is suggested that this level of precision
   be adopted as the limit of acceptability of calibration of these
   monitor systems. In these circumstances. the modified WHO-type ISI
   calibration appeared to be satisfactory for the POCT whole-blood
   monitors.

AB An alternative approach to INR estimation is for laboratories to
   calibrate their own local system using calibrant plasmas supplied by
   manufacturers or reference laboratories. The purpose of the present
   study was to investigate the within-laboratory variability of a
   calibrant plasma procedure using various sets of lyophilized plasmas.
   INR had been assigned to 13 calibrant plasmas in a previous
   multi-center Study. Each of 10 other ("field") laboratories measured
   PTs in the 13 calibrant plasmas and in 15 local fresh coumarin plasmas,
   using three different thromboplastin reagents. Each fresh coumarin PT
   was converted to INR using a calibration procedure with a set of 4
   calibrants (1 normal + 3 abnormals). The abnormals of each set were
   either coumarin or artificial and were used with different assigned
   INR. When the INR had been assigned with a thromboplastin brand
   identical to the thromboplastin in the field laboratory, the procedure
   was named "reagent-specific" calibration. Otherwise the procedure was
   named "dissimilar" calibration. Using "reagent-specific" calibration
   procedures, relatively homogeneous INR were obtained for the fresh
   coumarin plasmas. whatever type of calibrant was used. In contrast.
   discrepant INR were obtained when "dissimilar" cross-species
   calibration procedures were used. The study was limited to 9
   laboratories using the same type of coagulometer and one using a
   different type.

AB The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of magnesium
   and manganese ions on tissue factor (TF)-induced coagulation and the
   possible role of factor IX therein. When magnesium chloride or
   manganese chloride were added in low concentrations to normal human
   plasma, the human (recombinant) TF-induced coagulation time was
   shortened. At higher concentrations, magnesium and manganese prolonged
   the TF-induced coagulation time. Maximum shortening of the coagulation
   time was obtained at a concentration of 0.5 mmol/l Mn or 2 mmol/l Mg in
   plasma. Shortening of the TF-induced coagulation time by magnesium and
   manganese was also observed in factor IX-deficient plasma. A comparison
   was made between TF preparations from human, rabbit, and bovine brain.
   The accelerating effect of magnesium was greater with human than with
   rabbit brain TF. Using bovine brain TF, the clotting time was not
   shortened by magnesium. Activated factor X-induced coagulation of
   normal plasma was not accelerated by magnesium. From these experiments,
   it is inferred that activation of factor X by factor VII-TF can be
   accelerated by magnesium and manganese ions independently of factor IX.

ID CALIBRATION
AB Background: To simplify International Sensitivity Index (ISI)
   calibration, the possibility of substituting fresh plasma for fresh
   whole-blood samples with point-of-care testing (POCT) whole-blood
   monitors was investigated in a three-center study of three different
   POCT systems.
   Methods: A modified full WHO calibration procedure based on 20 healthy
   controls and 60 coumarin-treated patients was performed on three
   monitoring systems with whole-blood and plasma samples against plasma
   tested using the European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation (ECAA)
   rabbit reference plain thromboplastin and the manual prothrombin time
   (PT) method.
   Results: With one of the three systems, the mean ISI was 1.51 for whole
   blood and 1.49 for plasma; with the second system, the mean ISI was
   1.08 for both whole blood and plasma. With the third system, however,
   the difference between the mean ISI for whole blood and that for plasma
   was greater (1.15 and 1.01, respectively). Overall, the precision of
   the calibrations was less than with traditional manual plasma PT
   testing.
   Conclusions: Provided that an appropriate calcium chloride
   concentration is used, the plasma PT results can be used for accurate
   ISI calibration of two of these three whole-blood POCT systems.
   Precision criteria need to be modified for POCT monitors. (C) 2002

AB Oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is usually monitored by noting changes
   in a tissue factor-induced coagulation time ("prothrombin time") test
   on whole blood or plasma and expressed as an International Normalized
   Ratio (INR). Current point-of-care (POC) instruments for monitoring OAC
   therapy display both the calculated prothrombin time (PT) and the INR.
   Although many attempts have been made to improve the accuracy and
   precision of INR determinations in daily practice, it is impossible to
   eliminate all uncertainty because the PT test is sensitive to multiple
   factors in the patient's blood specimen. The accuracy of the average
   INR determined with a POC instrument depends on its calibration against
   reference methods. Quality control (QC) materials for POC devices are
   different from patients' samples and may not exactly reflect the real
   clinical situation. Nevertheless, internal and external QC schemes for
   POC devices are valuable to investigate their performance in daily
   practice. Calibration can be improved by direct comparison of a POC
   system against an established international reference preparation
   method. In general, the precision of the INR measured with a POC device
   is slightly lower than the precision achieved with available automated
   laboratory instruments. The greater imprecision should be weighed
   against the clinical advantages of a POC testing device.

DT Proceedings Paper
AB Digital cities are developing on many places, and settings, aims,
   design, organization, and functionality differ among the various
   systems. Do differences in content influence use and users? In this
   paper we compare two relatively successful but dramatically different
   digital cities. The study is based on quantitative and qualitative
   research, using various data. Although digital cities are generally
   conceived as local information infrastructures, and as a means for
   enhancing democratic participation, users primarily appreciate it as a
   tool for communication. We also observed, among others, how cyberspace
   reproduces the dynamics of 'established and outsiders', which inclines
   us to think that 'virtual public space' is not as open as is often
   claimed.

TI The cognitive and the social structure of STS
SO SCIENTOMETRICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The differentiation of scientific fields into sub-fields can be studied
   on the level of the 'scientific content' of the sub-field, that is on
   the level of the products, as well as on the level of the 'social
   structures' of the sub-field, that is on the lever of the producers of
   the content. By comparing the behavior of the constructs with the
   behavior of the constructors, we are able to demonstrate the analytical
   distinction between a cognitive and a social approach in an empirical
   way.
   This will be illustrated using the case of integration and
   differentiation in Science and Technology Studies (STS), Elsewhere,
   using relations between documents, I showed how STS is characterized by
   strong differentiation tendencies. In this paper I address the question
   to what extent this differentiation is also reflected in the social
   structure of the STS field. Can STS scholars and STS research groups be
   classified in terms of the sub-fields? Or do researchers and institutes
   carry an integrative role in the STS field? Are the relations between
   the sub-fields of STS maintained by individual researchers or research
   institutes, and to what extent? The analysis in this paper reveals that
   this is generally not the case. Although we are able to distinguish
   analytically between the cognitive and social dimension of the
   development of the research field, we find similar patterns of
   differentiation an the social level too. At the same time, this
   differentiation differs in some respects from the cognitive
   differentiation pattern.
   Consequently, the social and the cognitive dimensions of the STS field
   are not independent as no serious STS scholar would argue - but also
   not identical, as radical constructivists claim, but are strongly
   interacting Further analysis may reveal the leading dynamics, that is
   answering the question whether the 'social' follows the 'cognitive',
   the other way around, or whether the dynamics has the pattern of
   'co-evolution'.

AB Magnesium ions were detected in sodium citrate solutions in several
   lots of evacuated blood collection tubes. The mean concentrations
   ranged between 1.3 and 1.6 mmol/L. Magnesium was also present in the
   rubber stoppers of the blood collection tubes and could be leached into
   the citrate solution. It was shown that magnesium added to citrated
   plasma shortened the prothrombin time of both coumarin and normal
   plasma. The effect of magnesium was relatively greater on coumarin than
   on normal plasma resulting in reduced prothrombin time ratio.
   Shortening of the prothrombin time was also observed when magnesium
   chloride was added to dialysed plasma, i.e., in the absence of citrate.
   These results indicate that magnesium contamination can interfere with
   accurate INR determination in the control of oral anticoagulant therapy.

AB The prothrombin time is usually measured in citrated plasma. The W.H.O.
   recommended concentration of sodium citrate for blood collection for
   laboratory control of oral anticoagulant therapy is 0.109 M. Some
   evacuated blood collection systems include 0.105 M sodium citrate. The
   purpose of the present study was to establish the difference in ISI
   calibration between 0.109 and 0.105 M citrate, using 7 types of
   thromboplastin and various types of instrumentation. The two citrate
   concentrations were provided in both evacuated siliconised glass tubes
   and in evacuated polyethylene terephtalate (PET) tubes. The ISI
   difference between the two citrate concentrations was 5.4% for one
   system but not greater than 3% for all other systems when blood samples
   were collected with either siliconized glass or PET tubes. Most of the
   ISI differences between the two citrate concentrations were not
   significant at the 5% level. It is concluded that the ISI differences
   between 0.105 M and 0.109 M citrate are not of practical importance. In
   contrast, ISI differences between siliconised glass and PET tubes,
   using either 0.105 or 0.109 M citrate, were significant (p < 0.05) for
   most thromboplastin systems and amounted to 7%. ISI interchange between
   these glass and PET tubes could induce WR differences amounting to 14%.
   which could affect clinical dosage of oral anticoagulants.

AB This paper analyzes the communication between science and technology
   journals (STS), to illustrate patterns of differentiation and
   integration within scientific fields. First the STS field is
   delineated, using journal-journal citations as the empirical base. A
   strong and increasing differentiation is found, between 'qualitative
   STS','quantitative STS' (scientometrics), and 'S&T policy studies'.
   Given this process of differentiation. the relations between the three
   sub-fields of STS are analyzed, in terms of mutual flows of
   information, the joint information base, and research topics. Is
   differentiation and codification of sub-fields visible? The findings
   suggest that the relations between qualitative and quantitative STS are
   one-sided, and that integration between the sub-fields is almost
   completely lacking. However, the relations between scientometrics and
   S&T policy studies are much stronger and more substantial, and the same
   is the case for scientometrics and information science.

AB The CoaguChek(R) PT system is a portable point-of-care device for
   prothrombin time testing that can be used with capillary and venous
   whole blood. This system had been calibrated by the manufacturer in
   terms of the international normalized ratio (INR) for monitoring oral
   anticoagulant therapy. The purpose of the present study was to compare
   capillary blood with venous blood INRs from healthy volunteers and
   patients treated with oral anticoagulants using the same CoaguChek(R)
   PT system. Two different CoaguChek(R) PT strip formulations
   [international sensitivity index (ISI), 1.5 and 1.1] were used in
   separate test series. The differences between capillary and venous
   blood INRs were statistically significant (P < 0.001) but the magnitude
   of the differences was small. The mean relative deviations of the INR
   were 5.8 and 2.8% for the strips with ISI 1.5 and 1.1, respectively.
   These deviations are clinically acceptable. It is concluded that
   capillary blood can be replaced by venous blood for the calibration of
   the CoaguChek(R) PT system. Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis 11:559-562 (C)

AB Aims-To determine the conditions of photodynamic inactivation of
   vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) added to pooled coumarin plasma and
   the effects of the photodynamic treatment on the prothrombin times and
   international normalised ratio (INR) in a Netherlands national external
   quality assessment scheme.
   Methods-Pooled coumarin plasma samples were illuminated with visible
   light in the presence of 1 mu M methylene blue. Inactivation conditions
   for VSV in pooled coumarin plasma were determined using an end point
   dilution assay. Plasma illuminated for 20 minutes was mixed with red
   blood cells and mailed to participants of the Netherlands external
   quality assessment (EQA) scheme. Prothrombin times and INRs were
   determined with various thromboplastin reagents.
   Results-Photodynamic treatment using 1 mu M methylene blue and 700
   W/m(2) caused 4.7 log inactivation of VSV in pooled coumarin plasma.
   Fibrinogen and coagulation factors II, V, VII, and X were decreased
   slightly by the treatment. These conditions caused prolongation of the
   prothrombin time in EQA surveys. The magnitude of the effect was
   different for various thromboplastin reagents. The increase of the INR
   was negligible when measured with the Thrombotest reagent. With other
   reagents, an approximately 5-16% increase of the INR was observed.
   Interlaboratory variation of the INR was not affected by photodynamic
   treatment.
   Conclusions-Photodynamic treatment of pooled coumarin plasma is very
   effective for the inactivation of some enveloped viruses such as VSV,
   but has only a limited effect on the prothrombin time and INR.
   Photodynamic treatment can be used to improve the viral safety of
   coumarin plasma for EQA of the prothrombin time and INR.

AB The interlaboratory variation of the International Normalized Ratio
   (INR) in various external quality assessment schemes is still
   relatively high. This is partly caused by inaccuracy of manufacturers'
   stated International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and/or local
   instrumentation effects, The interlaboratory variation and accuracy of
   INR determinations may be improved by a local calibration procedure
   based on lyophilized plasmas with assigned INRs. The purpose of the
   present study was to determine INR values for different types of
   lyophilized plasmas to be used for local calibration. A total of 13
   lyophilized plasmas tone normal, six from coumarin-treated patients,
   six artificially depleted) were analyzed by 10 laboratories, each using
   five calibrated prothrombin time (PT) systems. INRs were calculated for
   each plasma using each laboratory's specific ISI and mean normal
   prothrombin time values. In the same way, five deep-frozen pooled
   plasmas from coumarin-treated patients were analyzed. There were
   significant INR differences for the lyophilized plasmas between the
   prothrombin time systems, The differences were relatively small for the
   deep-frozen coumarin plasmas (CV 2.6-3.3%) and three lyophilized
   coumarin plasmas from one manufacturer (CV 3.7-4.8%). Important INR
   differences were observed for three lyophilized coumarin plasmas from
   another manufacturer (CV 9.5-14.1%) and several artificially depleted
   plasmas (CV 5.3-12.8%. The citrate concentrations in the artificially
   depleted plasmas were lower than those in the normal and coumarin
   plasmas. These differences should be considered in the selection and
   certification of plasmas as calibrants for local calibration of PT
   systems. The lyophilized plasmas' INR values obtained in the present
   study will be used for a field study of local PT calibration to assess
   their efficacy.

AB The possibility of reduction of numbers of fresh coumarin and normal
   plasmas has been studied in a multicentre manual prothrombin (PT)
   calibration of high international sensitivity index (ISI) rabbit and
   low ISI human reference thromboplastins at 14 laboratories, The number
   of calibrant plasmas was reduced progressively by a computer program
   which generated random numbers to provide 1000 different selections for
   each reduced sample at each participant laboratory. Results were
   compared with those of the full set of 20 normal and 60 coumarin plasma
   calibrations. With the human reagent, 20 coumarins and seven normals
   still achieved the W.H.O. precision limit (3% CV of the slope), but
   with the rabbit reagent reduction < 50 coumarins with 17 normal plasmas
   led to unacceptable CV, Little reduction of numbers from the full set
   of 80 fresh plasmas appears advisable. For maximum confidence, when
   calibrating the lSI of a new reagent, it would always seem worthwhile
   to use the full number of patients and normal plasmas at each centre
   for the initial calibration, i.e. 60 fresh coumarin and 20 fresh normal
   plasmas. Smaller numbers should achieve the required precision with the

AB An underlying assumption of the WHO orthogonal regression model for
   prothrombin time standardisation is that a single line describes the
   relationship between PT of abnormal and normal plasmas. The aim was to
   evaluate Tomenson's correction for lack of coincidence using the model
   of the ECAA human reagent with lyophilized plasma calibrations. Local
   ISI calibrations using ECAA lyophilized normal and abnormal plasmas
   were performed on coagulometers with the ECAA human thromboplastin.
   They gave a high incidence of non-linearity of the two calibration
   slopes. The mean percentage deviation from assigned values of the
   target coumarin plasmas coagulometer INR at 45 centres before local ISI
   correction was 16.6% and 11.9% respectively in two studies. After local
   ISI calibration, the unsigned deviation was reduced to 5.54% and 6.61%
   respectively, Tomenson's correction for non-linearity further reduced
   the mean deviation to 3.08% and 2.96 % respectively in the two studies
   demonstrating the value of the procedure.

AB Five tissue factor reagents and three types of automated instruments
   for prothrombin time (PT) determination were studied in an
   international multicenter collaborative exercise. The purpose of this
   work was to determine the international sensitivity index (ISI) for
   each combination of reagent and instrument against the international
   reference preparation RBT/90. Each type Of instrument was used by 3 or
   4 centers to assess the interlaboratory variation of the ISI. The
   interlaboratory variation of the ISI for each combination of reagent
   and instrument ranged between 0.4% and 7.8% coefficient of variation.
   For three reagents. the mean ISI values for ACL (nephelometric) and STA
   (mechanical) were practically identical, but the mean ISI values for
   MLA (photo-optical) were at least 10% higher. For two other reagents
   prepared from rabbit tissue, the mean ISI values increased in the order
   ACL, STA. MLA. The widest range of mean ISI values was noted with one
   rabbit tissue factor reagent: 1.68 for ACL and 2.00 for MLA. Exclusion
   of patient specimens with INR <1.5 and INR >4.5 determined by the
   international reference preparation resulted in a slight decrease of
   the mean ISI.
   The interlaboratory variation of the International Normalized Ratio
   (INR) was assessed from the results obtained with common lyophilized
   and deep-frozen plasmas. The use of instrument-specific ISI values
   resulted in reduced interlaboratory variation of the INR. It is
   recommended that thromboplastin manufacturers provide
   instruments-specific ISI values.

AB Guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO) state that in
   order to calibrate a prothrombin time system for International
   Sensitivity Index (ISI), freshly prepared specimens from 20 normal
   individuals and 60 patients receiving coumarin are required. These
   numbers are required to obtain a precise value of the calibration line
   slope when there is considerable scatter of individual data about the
   regression line. The scatter can be reduced by pooling individual
   plasma samples. In the present study, four pooled plasmas were
   prepared, one from 20 normal individuals and three from three groups of
   30 patients receiving treatment with long-term oral anticoagulants.
   Prothrombin times were determined with four thromboplastins,
   HepatoQuick (rabbit thromboplastin combined with adsorbed plasma),
   Recombiplastin (recombinant human thromboplastin), Thromborel-S (human
   placenta), and Thromboplastin-C Plus (rabbit brain). Calibration line
   slopes were calculated for the six possible combinations of
   thromboplastins using the set of all individual plasma samples and the
   set of four pooled plasmas. In most comparisons, the WHO calibration
   model was appropriate, i.e. the line calculated for the patients'
   samples passed through the mean of the normals. The calibration line
   slopes obtained with the set of four pooled plasmas did not differ by
   more than 5% from the corresponding slopes calculated with the original
   individual plasmas. For some combinations of thromboplastins non-linear
   relations were observed both with the individual plasmas and with the
   pooled plasmas. We conclude that pooling individual plasmas does not
   significantly change the calibration relation between prothrombin times
   determined with the original individual plasmas. Freshly pooled plasmas
   can be used to determine the ISI of prothrombin time systems with an
   acceptable degree of precision. (C) 1998 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Local calibration studies have been performed with lyophilized plasmas
   at 155 European laboratories to assess coagulometer effects on manual
   ISI of ECAA thromboplastins (low ISI human recombinant and high ISI
   rabbit brain). Common sets of 7 normal and 20 artificially depleted
   lyophilized plasmas were tested with the thromboplastins in the routine
   local coagulometers. With the human reagent, marked lowering of the
   manual ISI resulted with most coagulometers, which was associated with
   disproportionate shortening of the normals. Where this shortening did
   not occur, there was little coagulometer effect on the ISI. With the
   rabbit reagent, proportionate shortening with both normal and abnormal
   plasmas occurred in most instruments with little effect on ISI. INR
   correction by local ISI assignment appeared successful with the ECAA
   human reagent. There was negligible INR correction from local
   calibration of the ECAA rabbit reagent in coagulometers where
   thromboplastin ISI were unchanged from the ECAA established manual
   values.

AB International sensitivity index calibrations based on the W.H.O,
   recommended method depend on orthogonal regression analysis, As this is
   not readily available in statistical packages, comparison has been made
   with simple linear regression analysis in a study of coagulometer
   effects on the International Normalized Ratio (INR) at 155 European
   centres, Sets of seven lyophilized normal and 20 lyophilized
   artificially depleted abnormal plasmas were provided with five coumarin
   test plasmas and two European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation
   reference thromboplastins (low International Sensitivity Index (ISI)
   human and high ISI rabbit). Local ISI based on the artificially
   depleted lyophilized plasmas using conventional orthogonal regression
   gave good correction for local coagulometer effects on the human
   reagent and minimal correction with the rabbit reagent INR. Results
   were considerably worse after attempts at correction using calibration
   based on linear regression analysis with both reagents. The results
   indicate that calibration of coagulometer prothrombin time systems
   using simple linear regression is not appropriate.

AB Objective.-To review the state of the art of laboratory monitoring of
   oral anticoagulant therapy, as reflected by the medical literature and
   the consensus opinion of recognized experts in the field, and to make
   recommendations for improvement in laboratory monitoring of oral
   anticoagulant therapy.
   Data Sources.-Review of the medical literature, primarily from the last
   10 years, and current laboratory practices by a panel of 8
   international experts in the field of oral anticoagulant monitoring.
   Data Extraction and Synthesis.-After an initial assessment of the
   literature, key points were identified. Experts were assigned to do an
   in-depth review of the literature and current practices relevant to
   each of the key points and to prepare a summary of their findings and
   recommendations. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated to
   every participant in the College of American Pathologists Conference
   XXXI on Laboratory Monitoring of Anticoagulant Therapy prior to the
   conference. Each of the key points and associated recommendations was
   then presented for discussion at the Conference. Recommendations were
   accepted if a consensus of the 26 experts attending the Conference was
   reached. The results of the discussion were used to revise the
   manuscript into its final form.
   Conclusions.-Consensus was reached on 12 recommendations concerning the
   laboratory monitoring of oral anticoagulant therapy. Detailed
   discussion of the rationale for each of these recommendations is found
   in the text of this article. Discussion of points on which consensus
   was not reached is also included in the text. It is hoped that
   widespread adoption of these recommendations will further improve the
   laboratory monitoring of oral anticoagulant therapy.

AB Artificially-depleted lyophilized plasmas and lyophilized coumarin
   plasmas were prepared and compared with fresh coumarin plasmas to
   assess their comparative reliability in local thromboplastin
   calibration using the manual prothrombin time (PT) technique. Their
   certified PT values were inserted in turn on the vertical axis in place
   of the PT obtained with fresh coumarin plasmas. PT results were
   obtained at eight ECAA national laboratories ('test centres') and
   inserted on the horizontal axis. The resulting thromboplastin
   calibration slopes were compared with conventional fresh coumarin
   plasma calibration slopes at the same 'test centres'. When 60
   artificially-depleted plasmas were substituted for 60 fresh plasmas,
   the mean calibration slopes with the human plain International
   Reference Preparation (IRP) were 4.2% higher. For comparison with 20
   lyophilized coumarins, three sets of 20 artificially-depleted plasmas
   were selected in sequential order from the 60. The lyophilized coumarin
   plasmas gave a mean deviation of 9.6% from the fresh plasma calibration
   slopes compared with values of 2.0%, 6.1% and 11.7% for the three sets
   of 20 depleted plasmas.
   Although both types of lyophilized plasma calibration slopes give
   measurable differences from conventional fresh plasmas, these may be
   regarded as acceptable in clinical terms.

AB Aim-To assess reliability of like to like and cross species
   calibrations using two types of certified freeze dried plasma
   calibrants-artificially depleted of vitamin K clotting factors, and
   from coumarin treated patients.
   Methods-Six ECAA national control laboratories provided certified
   values for the freeze dried plasmas in terms of the human plain
   international reference preparation (IRP) (BCT/441) with the manual
   prothrombin time technique. Eight other ECAA national laboratories
   determined international sensitivity index (ISI) values in full fresh
   plasma same species and cross species WHO calibrations against a low
   ISI human IRP (BCT/441) of the ECAA low ISI human thromboplastin and
   high ISI ECAA rabbit thromboplastin. Parallel calibrations were
   performed using the certified values.
   Results-Calibrations on fresh plasmas of the human ECAA reference
   thromboplastin (stated ISI = 0.95) gave ISI of 0.957 against the human
   IRP and 1.66 against the rabbit IRP. The ECAA rabbit (stated ISI =
   1.67) gave an identical value on the fresh plasma calibration v the
   human IRP. With freeze dried depleted plasmas certified in terms of the
   human IRP, the ISI of the ECAA human was 1.01, but the ECAA rabbit
   (stated ISI = 1.67) gave a low ISI of 1.47. The freeze dried coumarin
   plasmas gave an ISI of 0.943 for the ECAA human but only 1.493 for the
   ECAA rabbit.
   Conclusions-Fresh plasmas give reliable ISI when calibrating
   thromboplastins in same species and cross species calibrations. Freeze
   dried plasmas certified in terms of a single IRP, whether artificially
   depleted or of coumarin plasma origin, cannot be used for calibration
   of dissimilar thromboplastins.

AB The minimum requirement of lyophilized plasma samples for a reliable
   International Sensitivity Index (ISI) was assessed by calibrations
   based on reducing numbers from a maximum of 60 depleted and 20 plasma
   samples from patients receiving coumarin using a manual technique and
   low ISI thromboplastin. The probability of achieving an international
   normalized ratio (INR) result within a clinically important range of
   20% deviation has been assessed at European Concerted Action on
   Anticoagulation (ECAA) national laboratories in calibrations of ECAA
   reference thromboplastin against the certified prothrombin time (PT)
   with a reference thromboplastin. With conventional orthogonal
   regression using a certified PT and linear regression using certified
   INR, deviations and the coefficient of variation of the calibration
   slope increased with reduced numbers. The INR deviations became marked
   when the number of abnormal plasma samples was reduced to fewer than
   20. Calibrations of 3 abnormal plasma samples and 1 lyophilized normal
   plasma sample gave a high incidence of deviations greater than 10% with
   an INR of 3.0. The study demonstrates that with both methods of
   analysis, an optimum minimum number of lyophilized plasma samples is
   needed for a reliable local ISI.

   therefore been prepared at the ECAA Central Facility and studied at 143
   laboratories in sixteen European states using coagulometers in serial
   field exercises. All centres tested either the high ISI ECAA rabbit or
   low ISI ECAA human reference thromboplastin. The MNPT of fresh plasmas
   and means of the lyophilized samples were closely comparable with most
   routine rabbit thromboplastins. Using human thromboplastins means with
   the lyophilized normals were marginally but significantly longer and
   with the bovine Thrombotest significantly shorter than the MNPT of
   fresh plasmas causing alterations in INR. There was no appreciable
   effect on INR Of 2.5 and 3.5 when lyophilized normals were substituted
   for fresh normals with the rabbit reagents.
